PREFACE
The purpose of this volume is to present, in harmony with the popular
character of the series of which it is a part, brief sketches of
some of the most familiarly named men and well-known incidents in
the history of Western Civilization. The plan upon which the work is
constructed assumes that the broad highway of historical narrative
must be followed, however attractive may be the deviations from it
that offer themselves at almost every page. The story told here has
been told often before and very frequently the telling of it has come
from master hands of literature. It is no easy task to reproduce, in
a condensed form, material so often handled under much more generous
limitations of space than are possible in this work. An attempt
has been made, however, to escape from the bald tabular method of
recording historical happenings that is almost certain to make a
continuous reading of text-book history an impossibility. This must
be the apology for many omissions; not only had the temptation to
generalize to be resisted in favor of what might be called a process
of arbitrary selection but many things are passed over in order to
give appropriate emphasis in treating the matters which do actually
appear in a narrative. If the volume had aimed at comprehensiveness,
many more conquests would necessarily have been described and the list
of characters and leaders in large numbers of military campaigns could
of course be almost indefinitely enlarged. One can say in any case
that though such additions will naturally suggest themselves, there
is less doubt as to the claim of the leaders and events selected to
appear with the prominence here assigned to them. If there has been a
guiding principle in the selection, it may be found in the deliberate
choice made of widely different periods of history. What may be called
the group conquest is best illustrated in the case of the Ottoman
Sultans and the Spanish Conquistadors, whereas the personal factor of
the conqueror comes intensively forward in the chapters describing
Alexander, Cæsar, and Napoleon. Although the military aspect of the
history of conquest has not been neglected, the other less visible
elements that ushered in great changes in history have not been
omitted. In the preparation of the volume some attempt has been made
to incorporate methods, points of view, and material that might not
be accessible to those not concerned with the range of literature
to which the ordinary student of history must appeal. It is only
fair, therefore, to express my obligations to the following works.
In the chapters dealing with ancient history, Beloch’s “Griechische
Geschichte,” Delbrück’s “Kriegs Geschichte,” Kaerst’s “Geschichte
des Hellenismus” and Heitland’s “History of the Roman Republic” have
been largely used. In the chapter on Charles the Great, apart from
Hodgkin’s well-known volumes “Italy and Her Invaders,” I have drawn
upon Hartmann’s “Geschichte Italiens,” Ranke’s “Welt Geschichte,”
Hauck’s “Kirchen Geschichte” and Lavisse’s “Histoire de France.” For
the Ottoman conquest Professor Jorga’s two recently published volumes,
“Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches,” have been found especially useful
because the author is thoroughly acquainted with the authorities both
Slavonic and Turkish not previously accessible to Occidental scholars.
In the chapter on the Spanish Conquest use has been made of Payne’s
“History of the New World,” MacNutt’s “Life of Las Casas,” and in the
narrative portion Garcia’s “Character de la Conquista Española” has
been found especially valuable. In the life of Napoleon, which offers
the most serious difficulties in applying any accepted method of
condensation, the well-known volumes of Fournier and portions of the
“Histoire Générale” of Lavisse and Rambaud have been followed. Much
help has been received from Professor W. P. Trent, the editor of the
series; in the arduous task of revision, I wish to express my special
obligations for time and work ungrudgingly given by my colleague, the
Rev. S. L. Tyson of the University of the South, and I cannot pass over
aid of the same kind received from Mr. Karl Schmidt of the New York
_Churchman_.W. L. B.SEWANEE, TENN., _January, 1913_.

I INTRODUCTORY
Even in the critical time of the Persian invasion, the Greek peoples
did not act together. The experiences of political individualism were
too strong to be overcome, and the rooted tradition of local autonomy
successfully resisted all attempts at larger plans of unity. It is not
surprising that at a time when Greek thinkers regarded the development
of the city-state as the highest field for human endeavor, Greek
statesmen should have seen in the expansion of their native communities
only a loose federation of subject cities to be exploited financially
or for the purpose of adding increased military and naval strength, and
not to be subjected to any formal centralized control.[Illustration: ALEXANDER]As time went on the old solidarity of the Greek city-state was sapped
in the fight of social classes and political parties. Not only were
Athens, Sparta, and Thebes frequently at war with one another but in
each one of these states there were at work factions dominated by
revolutionary aims. Nothing was regarded as fixed except that the
community must be self-sufficing, it mattered little in what way. It
seemed as if the troubled relations of Greek political life might go on
indefinitely after the Persian invasion had been repelled.No Greek statesman for a hundred and fifty years, say roughly from 500
B.C. to 350 B.C., the most brilliant period of Greek history, regarded
the kingdom of Macedon as anything but a negligible quantity. Macedon
itself was a land that lay on the boundaries of the Hellenic world.
Its people were held to be half Hellenic and half barbarian. Even
to-day scholars are not at one on the question whether the Macedonian
dialect can be reckoned as properly belonging to Greek speech. But
it was this alien power that ended in bringing Greece to a kind of
unity, a unity based on the force of arms. The most remarkable feature
of this achievement lies in the fact that it was accomplished by one
man, Philip of Macedon, who began his victorious career in 359 B.C. by
repressing internal disturbances at home and by dealing effectively
with his warlike neighbors, the Illyrians and the Thracians. The
divisions in Greece gave him the opportunity of intervention there.
He posed as the friend of the oligarchic party in various Greek
communities, and made it his aim to oppose by diplomacy and by war the
most important center of Greek democracy, Athens. The final struggle
between the free states and the Macedonian monarchy took place at the
battle of Chæronea, August, 338 B.C. Philip won a decisive victory,
because he had spent years in training a professional army that proved
irresistible when it faced the best citizen soldiers of Athens,
Thebes, and other smaller towns which, persuaded by the eloquence of
Demosthenes, stood side by side in the defense of liberty. Philip
survived his victory only a short time, dying in 336 B.C. as the master
of Greece and leaving to his son Alexander the heritage of his unique
achievements.
II THE CONQUEST OF GREECE
Alexander’s succession to the throne of Macedon seemed secured by his
father Philip’s sincere personal affection for him. His confidence in
Alexander’s ability, even in his son’s early youth, was manifested
in the assignment to him of the most responsible positions under his
father’s directions. Philip saw to it that his son should be carefully
educated by placing him under the charge of Aristotle. Good reports
must have come of his precocity, because Philip, while he was occupied
in the siege of Byzantium, handed over to Alexander, then only sixteen
years old, the administration of Macedon. Two years later, at the
battle of Chæronea, already mentioned as marking the downfall of Greek
freedom, the youth was placed at the head of the division of the army
which took the offensive at a critical part of the engagement, and
it was through this important command that the questionable honor of
striking the decisive blow in the defeat of the allied forces of free
Greece was ungrudgingly conceded to him.Philip, unattractive as his character was in so many ways, stained
as he was by savage passions and duplicity, at least performed
conscientiously and effectively a father’s part in preparing his son
for the high position he was to take in the future. But the domestic
situation of the Macedonian royal family was very far from being
modeled on that described in the Odyssey as befitting the heroes and
the leaders of men. Philip was lawless, and his numerous amours brought
him both difficulty and notoriety, for in his irregular relations he
did not scruple to disregard the customary conventions of Greek social
life. On his return from his campaign for the subjugation of Greece,
he became enamored of Cleopatra, a girl belonging to a distinguished
Macedonian family, whose uncle, Attalus, had a high place in the
government. Cleopatra’s position made it impossible for the King to
offer her the place of a royal mistress; accordingly he made her a
legitimate wife. Olympias and her son Alexander left Macedon, the queen
returning to her home in Epirus, and the crown prince withdrawing to
the traditional enemies of the Macedonians, the Illyrians.Philip, alarmed at the possibility of political combinations dangerous
to his throne, came to an agreement with Alexander by which the latter
was to return to his father’s court at Pella, and Olympias’ brother,
the prince of Epirus, was induced to give up his hostility against
his brother-in-law by a promise that he should have in marriage
Philip’s daughter, another Cleopatra. This alliance took place with
great ceremony in the summer of 336, in the ancient royal town of
Ægæ. Immediately after Philip prepared to set out to war with Persia.
During the marriage festivities, however, he was assassinated by one
of the members of his bodyguard, Pausanias, who in the confusion that
followed almost succeeded in making his escape. Personal motives were
assigned as grounds for this murder. Pausanias, it appears, had been
deeply insulted by Attalus, the uncle of Philip’s young wife Cleopatra,
and failing to get redress from the King, had so revenged on him his
injured honor. It has been asked why, if this were the case, he did not
strike at Attalus rather than Philip. The probability is that Philip’s
murder was inspired by a woman’s indignation.It was suspected immediately after the event that it was a case of
“cherchez la femme,” and all indications pointed to the outraged
Olympias as the author of the murder. Alexander himself was thought
to have been concerned in his father’s death, for his own rights of
succession were endangered by the influence of Cleopatra over Philip,
an influence no longer merely sentimental, since she had recently given
birth to a son. For this infant she would naturally strive to secure
the Macedonian crown, and Alexander would be left to play the uncertain
rôle of Pretender.Whatever happened at Ægæ, the fruits of the crime fell into Alexander’s
hands. He had been officially proclaimed his father’s heir. Of Philip’s
sons he was the only one who had been tested on the battlefield, and
he was also the one who had already shown capacity for leading the
state in such crises as were bound to result from his father’s murder.
Philip’s old companions in arms did not hesitate for a moment as to
the proper choice of a ruler. Alexander was immediately recognized as
king, and in the selection special weight was attached to the fact that
his cause was urged by Antipater, one of Philip’s closest friends and
supporters.In this way the young prince’s road to the succession was made easy;
there were no disturbances, and care was also taken that there should
be no competitors for the crown in the future, for the young son of
Cleopatra was killed. But these grim measures to establish domestic
peace did not stop here. There was another line of Macedonian princes,
descended from the dethroned family of Lynkestes; there were two
members of this house who might, by making awkward claims at unsuitable
times, give much trouble. These two, Heromenes and Arrhabæos, were
both executed, on the ground that they had acted as accomplices
with Pausanias in the conspiracy against Philip. They had a brother
Alexander, whose life was spared only because he was a son-in-law of
Antipater and had hailed Alexander as the new king immediately after
the murder.By these deeds of violence, Alexander became the acknowledged master
of Macedon, but the prospects outside his own country were anything
but favorable. In Asia, Attalus was at the head of the Greek cities.
As the uncle of Cleopatra he would naturally be a most bitter enemy
of Alexander. The uncertain future in Macedon was not lost on those
Greeks whose liberties Philip had so recently destroyed, and whose
acquiescence in the rule of Macedon was due only to their fear of
the conqueror. Now they were ready to throw off the yoke, needing
no excuse, but only an opportunity of rising, which the advent to
the throne of an untried youth made most hopeful. A revolt broke
out in Ambrakia and the Macedonian governor was driven out. Thebes
was preparing for a similar outbreak, and there were plain signs of
restlessness in Ætolia and in the Peloponnesus.Athens was the city to which all the opponents of Macedonian rule
looked for sympathy and support. The peace party there, who had gained
adherents among the Athenians because of the moderation shown by
Philip after his decisive victory at Chæronea, now lost ground because
patriotic hopes sprung anew to life at the unexpected death of the man
who had shattered the traditional system of Greek city autonomy.Every Greek regarded Macedon as an alien and semibarbarous power, and
one can sympathize with their view. Demosthenes was the leader of the
patriotic party in Athens, and all attempts to undermine his popularity
only put the partisans of Macedonia in a worse light in the eyes of
the Athenians. Whenever he was judicially attacked he came out of
the trial in triumph. Besides, the personal ascendancy of Demosthenes
protected the minor politicians who joined him as opponents of the
friends of the Macedonian monarch. Hyperides, who was responsible for a
decree calling every Athenian freeman, slave, and ally under arms for
the defense of the city against Philip after the defeat of the Greeks,
was brought to trial for his action and, despite the eloquence of the
pro-Macedonian orator, Aristogeiton, was acquitted.The current of popular emotion was even more plainly revealed when
the time came to deliver the oration, at the Attic feast of the
dead, to commemorate the citizens fallen at the battle of Chæronea.
The honor fell to Demosthenes, the one man whose implacable hatred
to the Macedonian dynasty and all its works was known to everyone.
Attempts were made in Athens to reform the terms of military service
by arranging that all citizens should be called out to defend
their country, and at the same time money was spent in putting the
fortifications of the city in a state to resist an army composed of
skilled troops and provided with the siege artillery of the time.But care had been taken not to invite attack while Athens was yet
unprepared. At the marriage feast of Ægæ appeared an Athenian
deputation bringing a golden wreath to Philip and a copy of a decree,
passed formally by the city, by which it undertook to surrender anyone
in its jurisdiction who should dare to plot against the king. When
the news of the assassination reached Athens, Demosthenes appeared
in the council in festal garb, and solemnly thanked the gods for the
deliverance done at Ægæ. He considered that Athens had nothing to fear
from the silly youth who now was ruling over Macedon.But Alexander showed that the great orator had not taken his
enemy’s measure. By the rapidity of his actions, he checked all
attempts to revolt. Suddenly appearing at the head of his army
in Thessaly, he received from the Thessalian allied cities the
position of commander-in-chief, as his father had done before him,
and moving rapidly south, he reached Thermopylæ, where he summoned
the Amphiktyons, and meeting no opposition, was declared by them
guardian of the temple at Delphi. Marching farther south to Thebes,
he prevented, by his presence with an overwhelming force, any
anti-Macedonian movement; and when the Athenians sent a delegation to
greet him, he was tactful enough not to ask for further guaranties of
good behavior on the part of the city they represented.The Hellenic league, which included all the Greek states south of
Thermopylæ and all the islands which had once owned the supremacy
of Athens, met again at Corinth and renewed with Alexander the same
agreement that had previously been made with his father, a treaty of
offensive and defensive alliance, and the chief command by land and
sea was assigned to the new king, as his father’s successor. After
this triumphal and peaceful progress, Alexander returned home, where
his barbarian neighbors were giving trouble by revolts against his
authority.In order to bring himself in contact with the Greek opposition to
Alexander, Attalus, one of the two commanders of the Macedonian army in
Asia, had entered into relations with Demosthenes, only a short time
after Alexander’s succession. As Cleopatra’s uncle he took a leading
part in engineering a conspiracy intended to supplant Alexander by
Amyntas, the young son of Perdikkas, the elder brother of Philip, who
by the traditional usage of the Macedonian monarchy was entitled to
succeed Philip. The success of Alexander in Greece convinced Attalus of
the futility of his schemes, and he therefore tried to make advances
to the young ruler. But Alexander was not to be placated, and, as a
deviser of conspiracies in his own interest, he showed that he had
nothing to learn from the practised hands of the Macedonian nobles.It would have been extremely unwise for Alexander to have shown himself
openly an enemy of Attalus, who enjoyed much popularity in the army.
Accordingly he made a show of friendship by graciously accepting the
advances of Attalus, and at the same time he despatched an associate,
Hekatæus, on whom he could rely, with directions to assassinate
him. The treacherous deed was made the easier, because Parmenio,
joint-commander with Attalus in Asia Minor, facilitated the plans of
the assassination, despite the fact that Attalus was married to his
daughter. The tribal interests of a half-barbarous people had full sway
among the Macedonians, so Parmenio, who had throughout his life been
conscientiously loyal to the Macedonian monarchy, did not scruple to
sacrifice his daughter’s husband, when it appeared that his son-in-law
was plotting to supplant the regularly accepted monarch of his people.Alexander’s difficulties were being quickly dissolved by crime and
bloodshed. The Macedonians had none of the political experiences common
to the free Greek communities, and assassination was regarded both as
an ordinary expedient for removing opponents, and as the logical method
of rounding off a policy that was complicated. With Attalus removed,
Alexander could proceed, without further hesitation, to strengthen his
position at home. Amyntas, the young pretender, was executed, and with
him all of the relatives of Attalus and Cleopatra. In this Borgia-like
program of eliminating possible claimants to the throne, only the
stepbrother of Alexander, a half-witted lad, Amidæus, was spared.
Later Alexander’s mother, Olympias, forced her rival, the queen-widow
Cleopatra, to commit suicide.With this orgy of crime, the reign of Alexander was ushered in, and one
reads with astonishment to-day the thin and specious apologies which
would excuse the young ruler, the real instigator of these atrocities.
As a matter of fact he early acquired the habit of assassination;
unfortunately he never unlearned it. Whatever may be argued in behalf
of his people, who were uncivilized, nothing can extenuate this early
exercise in crime of the pupil of Aristotle. When we survey his record
of one year we perceive that hatred of his deeds must have been the
test of patriotism and good citizenship among the Greek communities,
who might well see in him the typical tyrant of their political
theories.Alexander’s violent preparations for a peaceful reign were successful.
During his lifetime the tranquillity of Macedonia was not disturbed.
Greece had been brought by the display of military supremacy to a
position of servitude; all that needed to be done before he took up his
father’s program for the invasion of Asia, was to bring the western
tribes on his northern frontier to reason, and to force home upon them
the realization of the power of Macedon.In the spring of 335, Alexander left Amphipolis, and by a rapid march
of ten days reached Mount Hæmus in the thick of a population which
had never recognized the supremacy of Macedon. They tried to defend
themselves in their mountain passes, but Alexander soon forced his way
through, and on the top of the highest mountain, celebrated his victory
by setting up a thank offering to Dionysus. He then gave his attention
to various mountain tribes with whom his father had had trouble, who
had never before been subjugated, but who now met a decisive defeat
at his hands. An island on the Danube, where the tribesmen had placed
for security their wives and children and property, proved, however,
impregnable. The young king showed himself from the first a master of
strategy, for although he could not capture the island, he executed
rapid movements along the river, beating the Getæ who were defending
the passages, and when the Triballi had come to terms, he marched up
the Danube, and then, crossing the eastern passes of the Hæmus range,
returned to Pæonia.Alexander’s absence in the north in this untiring campaign against
barbarian tribes, whose homes and habits were hardly known to the
civilized states of Greece, was taken advantage of by his enemies.
While he was fighting on the Danube, the King of Illyria, Kleitos,
whose people had given trouble to Philip and whose father had fallen
in battle with the Macedonians, rose in revolt. Several tribes
farther north on the Adriatic coast joined with the Illyrians in this
anti-Macedonian movement. Without a moment’s hesitation, Alexander
turned to deal with his new enemies, and in order to do effective work,
penetrated far into the mountainous region of Illyria. The Macedonian
army soon found itself in a hazardous position, surrounded on all
sides by hostile tribes. By skilful strategy, Alexander withdrew his
troops from the danger that threatened them, while they were besieging
Pelion in the face of superior numbers, and when he found that the
Illyrians were following him, he quickly turned on them, administered a
decisive blow, and forced Kleitos to seek a refuge in the territory of
the Taulantines, one of the tribes which had been co-operating with the
Illyrians in their resistance to his army.In the meantime, the presence of a Macedonian force in Asia Minor had
awakened the Persians to the danger confronting them of an invasion
from Greece. Its full meaning was hardly appreciated, and the new
situation was interpreted as only another example of the type of attack
so frequently made by the Greek communities ever since the time when
the Persian invasion of Greece had been successfully blocked. It had
always been found possible to avoid a serious attack from Greece on
the Persian Empire by playing off one Greek state against another.
This well-tried expedient was now used again. Letters were sent from
the King of Persia to the states of Greece urging them to rise against
Macedon, and offering large sums of money to subsidize the revolt.
Sparta alone responded to the invitation; Athens and the other states,
which had just renewed a formal alliance with Macedon, seemed to
realize the hopelessness of an anti-Macedonian movement, and refused to
accept the offer of Persian money. All that the representatives of the
great king could accomplish in this direction was to leave in the hands
of Demosthenes the sum of three hundred talents, with the understanding
that he could use his own discretion in employing it to the best
advantage in the interests of Persia.The action of the great Athenian orator in accepting the Persian gold
has been severely criticised and warmly defended. It must be remembered
that to him Alexander appeared only as the destroyer of Greek liberty
and not as the protagonist of Greek culture, a position which can be
understood only as the result of his conquests in the East. There was
no reason why an Athenian patriot should have been willing to destroy
the Persian Empire at the cost of the enslavement of his own city.The perils and difficulties of the Illyrian campaign were magnified by
the rumors which reached the Greek cities. It was even reported that
Alexander had been slain and his army destroyed. This report was soon
followed by an uprising in Thebes against the Macedonians. The leaders
of the Macedonian faction were murdered and the Macedonian garrison
in the citadel closely besieged. The democratic constitution was
then restored and Theban officials were elected according to the old
constitutional forms. At this juncture, Demosthenes used some of the
Persian treasure to purchase arms, which he sent to Thebes to aid its
citizens in their contest for the restoration of their independence.While the Thebans were most active, the rest of Greece was not slow in
showing its antipathy to Macedonian control. Athens prepared itself to
do battle for Greek autonomy; the isthmus of Corinth was occupied by
an army raised from among the Arcadian cities, with Mantineia at their
head. And the people of Elis and Ætolia showed that they would be ready
to aid the Thebans.But before any common plan of resistance could be prepared, Alexander
and his army had passed the frontiers of Bœotia after a remarkably
rapid forced march, undertaken as soon as the news of the defection of
the Thebans had reached him in Illyria. It took him but fourteen days
in all to cover the distance from the scene of operations in Illyria to
the gates of Thebes. He was willing to come to terms with the Thebans,
offering them easy conditions provided they would admit his troops into
the city; but the mass of the inhabitants preferred to cast in their
lot with those who were in favor of resistance.The exiled citizens of Thebes knew they would receive short shrift
at the hands of the son of the man who had driven them from their
native city. The chances of successful resistance were overestimated,
but Thebes had formerly led a forlorn hope in its contest with the
Spartans; and, as the unexpected had happened before, the Thebans,
who were preparing to withstand the Macedonians can hardly be blamed
for recalling the glorious memories of the battle of Leuktra. But they
were now dealing with a new, vigorous army, not with a Spartan force
spoiled by routine. As no help could be looked for from the outside,
the situation was altogether different. The result proved that the
Thebans of Alexander’s day had inherited indeed the valor, but not the
intelligence, of the generation of Epaminondas and Pelopidas.The Macedonian garrison still held out in the Kadmeia, the citadel
which lay in the southern part of the city, near the gate of Elektra,
through which passed the road to Athens. Its walls were an integral
part of the fortifications of the city. The object of the Thebans
was therefore to cut off all communication from the Kadmeia by
building about it inclosing lines. This operation Alexander aimed to
prevent, and with Perdikkas at the head of a contingent of Macedonian
mountaineers, he succeeded in breaking through the Theban line of
defense, and finally forced his adversaries back to the walls of the
city. They were closely pursued in this retreat, and, as they entered
the gate in disorder, the Macedonians were able to force their way
into the city at the same time. Another division of the Macedonians
found little difficulty in entering the Kadmeia, and from this point
of vantage they quickly descended into the city. The Thebans made an
attempt to rally in the market place, but the rout was soon general.
After the city was overrun by the Macedonians and their allies, it
was noted that the people of the smaller Bœotian towns signalized
themselves by their acts of cruelty done on the now defenseless
Thebans, from whose tyranny they had suffered in the past. Six thousand
men, it is said, perished in the taking of Thebes, while the Macedonian
loss did not exceed 500. (September, 335 B.C.)Alexander called together his allies to settle the fate of the
conquered. The decision was a horrible example of rancorous hatred, for
he allowed the smaller cities of Bœotia, smarting, as we have seen,
under the sense of long grievances, to work their will on their once
powerful neighbor. The town was to be razed to the ground, only the
house of Pindar being spared. The sole part of the fortifications of
the town to be retained was the Kadmeia, which remained as a military
post with its Macedonian garrison. The Theban territory was to be
divided among the allies, and all the captive Thebans, men, women, and
children, with but a few exceptions, were to be sold as slaves. Those
Thebans who escaped from the city were to be outlawed, and no Greek
city would be permitted to receive them. The only positive items in
this ruthless decree were the provisions for restoring Orchemenos and
Platæa, places which Thebes had once treated with the severity now
meted out to her.Such a catastrophe, as the result of a defeat or a siege, had never
before been witnessed in Greece, and the impression produced was
one of unmitigated terror. It was not simply the misfortunes of the
existing Theban community, or the material loss from the annihilation
of property. Thebes had the closest associations with the heroic age of
Greece, its name was interwoven with the stories of gods and heroes.
Kadmus had founded it; within its limits Dionysus and Herakles had
been born. The city which had shattered the power of Sparta was left
desolate, and the plow passed over the ground where it had once stood.
It seemed according to a contemporary as if Zeus had torn the moon from
the heavens.The impression made throughout Greece by this barbarous deed was
universal; no one dared to think of resistance to Alexander. There was
a general desire among the various cities to place themselves in a
favorable position with the conqueror. The Arcadians condemned to death
those who had advised that aid should be given to the Thebans; in other
places the partisans of Macedonia were received back from exile, and
haste was made to acquaint Alexander of the general desire to meet his
wishes.The Athenians were celebrating their most solemn religious festival,
the Eleusinian Mysteries, when the taking of Thebes was announced.
There was widespread consternation, because it was assumed that the
next move of Alexander would be made against Athens in order to punish
its citizens for their anti-Macedonian sentiments. The celebration of
the festival was abandoned; the inhabitants of the open country took
refuge within the city walls, in anticipation of the ravaging of their
lands, and the fortifications surrounding the city were fully prepared
for defense. In spite of the plain dangers involved in showing sympathy
for the defeated Thebans, fugitives from that city were received with
an open-handed hospitality, and their needs cared for without stint.
But at the same time an opening for maintaining amicable relations with
the victor was preserved, by sending a formal embassy to Alexander to
congratulate him on his return from Illyria and for his quick victory
over the rebels in Thebes.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'The true situation of affairs in Athens was an open secret. Alexander
knew the part played by the Athenians in preparing for the Theban
revolt; he knew, too, that they had been on the point of actively
and openly co-operating with the Thebans, and that the plan had been
frustrated only by the rapidity with which he had moved on the city.
Yet the young ruler showed himself unexpectedly placable in his
treatment of Athens. There is no reason to attribute his attitude
to mere generosity of sentiment in favor of the city because of its
glorious past. There were more practical reasons; the siege of Athens
could hardly be successful except through command of the sea, and any
attempt of this kind would most likely have been frustrated or at least
rendered doubtful by the intervention of the Persian fleet.Instead of advancing into Attica, Alexander stopped to parley, and
agreed to abstain from hostilities on condition that the Athenians
should promptly expel the Theban fugitives, and also should surrender
to him the men who had been lately responsible for the anti-Macedonian
direction of the government. It is to the credit of the Athenians that
the first condition was without a negative rejected; and as to the
second there were many of the anti-democratic faction who would have
been glad to get rid of their opponents by agreeing to this indirect
demand of the Macedonian king that the government of the city should
be handed over to his partisans. Phokion, one of the distinguished
and revered members of the oligarchic group, was willing to accept
the condition unreservedly; but Demosthenes and Demades, another
popular leader, successfully urged the assembly of the people to vote
against it, and even Phokion agreed to head an embassy to acquaint
Alexander with the decision of the Athenian citizens. The king showed
himself ready to compromise, for the success of his schemes against
Asia depended largely on the good will of Athens and its fleet. It
was finally arranged that the Athenian anti-Macedonian military
leader Charidemos should be banished, a proposal to which it was all
the easier for the Athenians to accede, because he was not a native
Athenian. This officer and several others withdrew to Asia and took
service under Darius.
III THE CONQUEST OF PERSIA
Now that the pacification of Greece was effected by the restoration of
Athens as a member of the Macedonian confederacy, Alexander, without
visiting that city, marched to the isthmus of Corinth to arrange for
the various Greek contingents for his expedition to Asia, and after
receiving from the oracle at Delphi a reply encouraging him to carry
out his grandiose scheme of conquest, he retired to Macedonia to spend
the winter before setting out on his march against the Persian Empire.Of the details of his proposed invasion nothing is known beyond the
fact that his original scheme must have been considerably modified
as he penetrated farther into Asia. His geographical knowledge of
the interior of the empire could hardly have been sufficient for an
orderly mapping out beforehand of the course he actually took. That was
entirely governed by the extraordinary series of events which marked
the various stages of his expedition. His design was to dethrone
the Persian king and secure possession of the country. To do this
effectively the first step was to conquer Asia Minor, to get under his
control the remoter provinces of Syria and Egypt, and then to advance
on Babylon and Susa. That there was immediate necessity for setting his
army on the march was plain to him, because of the dangerous position
of the Macedonian forces already in Asia Minor. The Persian general,
Memnon, had checkmated Parmenio, who was recalled, and the prospects of
Macedonian success were blighted by the defeat of another Macedonian
general Kallás in the Troad. Before Alexander left his own kingdom,
the authority of the Persian government had been generally restored
throughout the whole of Asia Minor.In the spring of 334, Alexander marched to the Hellespont with an
army numbering altogether 30,000 infantry and 4500 cavalry. Of these,
12,000 infantry and 1500 cavalry were from Macedon; contingents from
the allies made up the rest. There were besides 160 warships, of
which Athens furnished twenty. Alexander’s chief military adviser
was Parmenio, whom Philip, his father, had declared to be the only
Macedonian general he had discovered in many years. Of the subordinate
officers the most noteworthy were Philotas, who was in command of the
Macedonian cavalry, and Nikanor, who led the álite of the Macedonian
infantry (the so-called Hypaspistæ, or the Bodyguards). During the
absence of the king, the administration of Macedon and of the subject
states was left in the hands of Antipater.The incompetence of the Persians in aggressive resistance was manifest
from the first. They were far superior to the Greeks at sea, and if
they had made intelligent use of their fleet they could have prevented
Alexander’s army from crossing the Hellespont. Indeed, orders had been
issued the year before to the coast cities that their ships should be
kept in readiness in anticipation of an invasion. But so slipshod was
the administration in the loosely governed provinces of Persia that
their great fleet was unable to put to sea when Alexander reached
the narrow arm of water which divides Europe from Asia. He had no
difficulty in passing; indeed Parmenio was left to superintend this
operation, while the young king visited the cities of the Troad rich
in legendary lore, and made a pilgrimage to the tomb of his reputed
ancestor, Achilles.The Greeks soon began their march down the coast. The satraps of the
neighboring provinces had in the meantime gathered together all the
troops available in the Propontis and had joined the army of Memnon.
From the statements made in contemporary sources, it is not possible to
gather the numerical strength of the army which now opposed Alexander’s
advance; it is certain, however, that in infantry the Persians were
weaker than the Greeks, while it is probable that they were also
outnumbered in cavalry.They were certainly aware of their weakness, because Memnon advised
against a stand-up battle, suggesting instead that they should retire
into the interior, wasting the country as they went, and so hinder the
rapidity of the enemy’s march until their own fleet appeared; then the
war could be carried into Greece and Alexander forced to retreat. But
this prudent strategy was not acceptable to the Persian satraps, who
preferred active measures that seemed to offer a chance of preventing
Alexander from getting a firm foothold in Persian territory.They prepared to offer battle by taking up a position on the river
Granicus, a stream flowing down from the northern slope of Mt. Ida
to the Propontis. It seems as if the Persians, conscious of their
weakness, selected a battlefield where their enemies, with a river in
front of them, would find it a matter of some difficulty to attack.
They may have supposed that Alexander would hesitate to advance under
such unfavorable conditions. The Macedonian army was so disposed
that the heavy-armed infantry held the center while the wings were
formed by the cavalry and the bowmen. Alexander himself was with the
picked Macedonian cavalry on the right wing; next him were arranged
the hypaspists, extending towards the middle. This wing, comprising
cavalry, bowmen, and heavy-armed troops, appears to have crossed the
river first and to have put to flight the Persian cavalry. That the
Persians used horsemen here and not bowmen seems strange. Cavalry were
of little use in preventing an advance up the steep slope from the
stream.First the Persian horse were put to flight by the right Macedonian
wing, commanded by Alexander, who took an active part in the
hand-to-hand conflict; then the phalanx of Greek mercenaries on the
Persian side, who had stood by hitherto without taking any part in the
engagement, were attacked in front by the Macedonian phalanx and on the
flanks by the cavalry and bowmen and, being thus prevented from making
any real resistance, were hewn down or taken prisoners. The Macedonian
loss was so small, eighty-five horsemen and thirty foot soldiers, that
it would seem that probably the Greek mercenaries, instead of resisting
their own kinsmen, allowed themselves to be taken prisoners. The brunt
of the battle was borne by the Persian horsemen, who fought valorously,
and in the obstinate scrimmage with them Alexander was in considerable
personal danger. Two of the satraps lost their lives on the field.
The Greek prisoners were sent in chains to Macedon, and of the booty
taken, 300 suits of armor were sent to the Parthenon at Athens as
a thank-offering, a visible reminder to the Greeks of the victor’s
progress. (May-June, 334 B.C.)The fruits of the victory were immediate: several of the principal
cities surrendered, among them Sardis, with its impregnable citadel,
and Ephesus. In both places Alexander was greeted as a deliverer from
Persian tyranny; democratic government was restored, and a beginning
was made for organizing a massacre of the oligarchic faction. This
Alexander prevented, making it clear by his intervention that he did
not wish to alienate the sympathies of the propertied classes in Asia.
Of the other Greek cities in Ionia and Æolis, only one gave serious
trouble, Miletus, which looked to the Persian fleet for aid. It was
occupied besides by a strong garrison of Greek mercenaries. Alexander’s
fleet, however, appeared at Miletus before the Persian fleet, which was
on its way from Cyprus and Phœnicia, reached the scene of action. When
this fleet came up, it tried in vain to entice the Macedonian ships
into an action, and remained idly by while Alexander besieged Miletus
and finally took it by storm.The sole stronghold still left to Persia in the region was
Halicarnassus to the south. Hither the Persian fleet repaired, and
here, as the place was strongly fortified and well manned with troops,
Memnon planned to establish a base for further operations by sea
against Greece itself. But Alexander declined to take the risk of
meeting the Persian fleet in a naval engagement. Winter was at hand,
and most of the Macedonian ships had been sent home; there was only
a small squadron left, and the king marched south with his army to
besiege Halicarnassus by land.The problem before him was anything but easy, for Halicarnassus,
besides being strongly fortified, had through the presence of the
Persian fleet free communication with the outside. It could be supplied
with food, although the opportunity of obtaining mercenary troops from
Greece was made difficult through the fear of Macedon. The city walls
were surrounded with wide ditches and these Alexander filled up, in
order to give access to his siege engines. Several breaches were made,
but the first attempt to storm the place failed, and the defenders of
the city erected new fortifications in place of those that had been cut
down. They also made a sortie, trying to destroy the siege engines,
but were repulsed with loss. Memnon saw that the town could no longer
be held, and by night embarked his troops, carrying them to Cos; but
before he left he set fire to the abandoned town. Alexander immediately
entered, showed himself merciful to its citizens, and proceeded
on his march, leaving a division of 3050 men to watch the citadel
of Halicarnassus, which evidently he did not think of sufficient
importance to besiege now that the Persians had only a small number of
troops in the neighborhood, in Salmakis and on the island Arconnesus.The whole of the province of Caria now ceased to resist, with the
exception of a few places on the coast. A part of the Greek army, under
the orders of Parmenio, were sent into winter quarters in Lydia, while
Alexander advanced through Lycia and Pamphylia, without meeting any
real resistance, and marched by the way of the mountainous country of
Pisidia, among a population never conquered by the Persians, and in
the spring of 333 joined Parmenio at Gordion, the ancient capital of
Phrygia. From here the route of the army was through Cappadocia by
the narrow pass called the Cilician Gate, by which the road from the
interior plateau crosses the Taurus on its way to Tarsus. The garrison
which occupied the pass fled on the approach of the Greek army, Tarsus
itself was abandoned, and the whole province of Cilicia was occupied
without resistance.In the meantime, however, Memnon had not been inactive, and he was
putting to good use his superiority in naval strength. Several islands
had either been occupied or were making preparations to join the
Persian general, and even in continental Greece the anti-Macedonian
influence was being felt. There was no question that Memnon’s arrival
on the shores of European Greece would be the signal for a general
abandonment of the Macedonian cause. Athens even sent an embassy to
Darius, although the city did not dare to join the Persians openly. In
the midst of these successes, Memnon was taken ill and died. Those who
succeeded him in the command showed none of his capacity. The fleet
was kept in inactivity, and though on land some small successes could
be put to the credit of the Persian arms in Asia Minor, the soldiers
operating there were soon directed to join the main army of Darius
in Syria, now being collected to meet the advancing Greeks. When the
news of Alexander’s victory at the Granicus reached the interior of
the Persian Empire, Darius began to draw together a large army, and
leaving Babylon in January, reached northern Syria in autumn. Alexander
was still in Cilicia, detained in Tarsus by a severe illness, and on
his recovery busied himself with the conquest of some of the coast
cities. But when he heard of the advance of Darius, he marched trough
the narrow pass near the coast which connects Cilicia and Syria, and
commenced the siege of Myriandros, the first Phœnician city on the
road. He evidently reckoned on Darius meeting him in the level places
of northern Persia, where the latter’s cavalry could be used to its
best advantage, but Darius showed a keener strategical instinct than is
usually associated with Persian generalship. While Alexander was taking
the coast road south, Darius’ army made a northerly movement, passing
over a difficult mountain region, and so appeared in the rear of the
Macedonian army on the level plain near Issus. The Persians had a
strong position; on their right was the sea, and on their left a chain
of mountains. On the front they were protected by the deeply worn bed
of the river Pinarus. They had also constructed a line of earthworks.The preliminary operations of the Persians were conducted with
great intelligence. By them Alexander was cut off from his base and
his position was desperate, unless he could restore his line of
communications by a successful engagement. This was no easy matter, for
the mountain defile, the Assyrian Gate, had to be passed through, a
place where the mountains and the sea are so close that there is room
only for a road. Darius had an excellent position but failed to make
any use of it. Without attempting to interfere he allowed Alexander to
march through the narrow strip of land between the mountains and the
sea and to change from a column formation into regular battle array.It took the Greek commander the whole night to make the journey from
Myriandros, a place south of the defile, to the level country on the
banks of the Pinarus. As Alexander’s army debouched on the plain, the
cavalry and the light-armed troops sent against them by Darius failed
to arrest their progress. The Persians were outmanœuvered from the
start, for on the plain, which had very narrow limits--a little more
than two miles wide--Darius could make no use of his superior numbers,
nor was there opportunity for bringing to bear to any purpose the
Persian advantage in cavalry. It was possible for Alexander to extend
his own line of battle just as far as the enemy could, and the nature
of the ground protected him against any enveloping manœuver. Thus the
disposable forces, on either side, were equalized, and on account of
the superior training and skill of the Macedonians, there was little
doubt from the first as to the issue of the fight.On the Greek side the left wing was commanded by Alexander in person,
and it was made up of the Macedonian cavalry, the hypaspists, and
a part of the ordinary infantry. The vigor of their onslaught was
irresistible, and the Asiatics opposed to them gave way after a short
struggle and fled. The whole Persian center was disorganized, even
Darius avoiding capture with difficulty. His chariots, his royal robes,
and his arms fell into the hands of the victorious Greeks. In another
part of the field Parmenio, who was in command of the left wing of
the Greek army, had no easy time in withstanding the charges of the
Asiatic cavalry, and also when the Macedonian phalanx undertook to
storm the heights which were occupied by Greek mercenary troops on the
other side, they were repulsed with considerable loss. Fortunately,
Alexander, after defeating the division opposed to him, was able to use
his infantry to attack the mercenaries on their rear, and they were
forced to withdraw from the field. They retired in good order, but the
Persian cavalry proved inefficient, and were repulsed with great loss.
In their flight they demoralized the reserves which had been placed
by the Persians immediately behind the line of battle. The Persian
army ceased to exist as a military entity and the fugitives were saved
from further pursuit only by the early nightfall of the autumn season.
Darius was able to bring together on the other side of the Syrian
mountains 4000 men, most of whom were Greek mercenaries, and with a
small force he recrossed the Euphrates. The main body of the Greeks,
attached to the army of Darius, made their way to Tripolis in Phœnicia
and from there sailed to Cyprus. (October, 333 B.C.)After the battle the Persian camp was occupied by the Greeks, and
among the captives were the mother of Darius and his wife, Stateira,
and her children. These members of the royal household were treated
considerately. Their presence with the Greek army was a most
valuable asset, and a few days after his defeat Darius began to open
negotiations for the purpose of having the captives restored to him.
Alexander showed no unfriendly spirit, and received an embassy with
formal proposals of peace from Darius. The conditions were, that all of
the country west of the Euphrates should be ceded and the large sum of
10,000 talents given for the return of the royal captives. In addition
to this, as a pledge of good faith, it was proposed that Alexander
should receive one of the king’s daughters in marriage. The offer was a
proof that Darius realized how deep was his humiliation and how small
the chance of successful resistance to the conqueror.Liberal as the terms were, it must have been plain to Alexander that
to make peace now was to leave his work half finished, especially as
the first half was the more difficult. In it he had defeated the best
soldiers under the command of Darius, and there was nothing more to
fear from the Persian fleet, its most important units being withdrawn
to protect Syria, nor was a rising in Greece likely to be attempted.
The news of the battle of Issus had made the anti-Macedonian faction
in the Greek cities see the purposelessness of counting on the
co-operation of Persia. At the Isthmian games the representatives of
the Hellenic confederation voted Alexander a golden crown as a defender
of the liberties of Greece.Alexander answered the proposition of the Persian king in a stern
mood, fully conscious of his strength. His letter to Darius, which
has been preserved, is a document that speaks in no uncertain tone.
“Your ancestors invaded Macedonia and the rest of Greece, and without
provocation inflicted wrongs upon us. I was appointed leader of the
Greeks and crossed over into Asia for the purpose of avenging those
wrongs; for ye were the first aggressors. In the next place ye assisted
the people of Perinthus, who were offenders against my father, and
Ochus sent a force into Thrace, which was part of our empire. Further,
the conspirators who slew my father were suborned by you, as ye
yourselves boasted in your letters. Thou with the help of Bagoas didst
murder Arses (son of Ochus) and seize the throne unjustly and contrary
to the law of the Persians, and then thou didst write improper letters
regarding me to the Greeks, to incite them to war against me, and
didst send to the Lacedæmonians and other of the Greeks, for the same
purpose, sums of money (whereof none of the other cities partook but
only the Lacedæmonians); and these emissaries corrupted my friends
and tried to dissolve the peace which I had brought about in Greece.
Wherefore I marched forth against thee who wert the aggressor in
general. I have overcome in battle first thy generals and satraps, and
now thyself and thine host, and possess thy land through the grace of
the gods. Those who fought on thy side and were not slain but took
refuge with me, are under my protection and are glad to be with me and
will fight with me henceforward. I am lord of all Asia, and therefore
do thou come to me. If thou art afraid of being evilly entreated, send
some of thy friends to receive sufficient guaranties. Thou hast only to
come to me to ask and receive thy mother and children, and whatsoever
else thou mayest desire. And for the future whenever thou sendest, send
to me as to the Great King of Asia, and do not write as to an equal,
but tell me whatever thy need be, as to one who is lord of all that is
thine. Otherwise I shall deal with thee as an offender. But if thou
disputest the kingdom, then wait and fight for it again and do not
flee; for I will march against thee, wherever thou mayest be.”Darius now set about collecting another army and made no more peace
proposals. He gathered the fragments of the force that had been beaten
at Issus, and to this were added contingents drawn from all the
furthermost parts of his empire still in his hands. The army so formed
was almost exclusively Asiatic, for of Greek mercenaries there were
only the soldiers, a few thousand all told, who had followed him in his
flight. No others could now be secured. Darius’ new plan was to await
the approach of Alexander on the plains of Assyria, where the Persian
cavalry could be used with most effect.On Alexander’s part there was no haste in turning to the interior.
Instead of following Darius, he remained on the sea coast, while
Parmenio was sent to Damascus with half the Greek army, to seize the
treasure left there by Darius before the battle of Issus. Alexander
with the rest of the army turned south to the conquest of the great
island city of Phœnicia, which unlike its smaller neighbors had refused
to surrender and had declared its neutrality to Alexander. Tyre was the
center of Persian sea power, and so long as it remained independent its
fleet could be used against the Greek king, either on the sea itself or
as an instrument for creating disturbances in continental Greece.The siege of Tyre involved special difficulties; not only were its
walls high and strong, but it was situated on an island separated
from the mainland by a shallow body of water. As Alexander had no
fleet adequate to conduct aggressive operations from the open sea
against the city, he planned to bring up his siege engines against
the walls from the land side, by building a causeway over the shallow
body of water. The defenders of the town tried repeatedly and with
great bravery to prevent such an approach from being made. Tyre’s own
commercial competitors, Cyprus and the less important Phœnician cities,
including Sidon, placed their navies at Alexander’s disposition, and
with their ships he began to operate from the sea. The situation of the
town was desperate, but its people made a defense as desperate and as
resourceful as their daughter city Carthage in later days against the
Romans.When the causeway was finally constructed, the walls on this side,
being 150 feet high and enormously thick, were not damaged by the
siege engines. Accordingly Alexander changed his plans quickly; the
engines were mounted in vessels and a breach was effected in one of the
battlements extending along the harbor. While the Macedonians were now
able to penetrate the city, they met with heavy resistance from the
besieged townsmen, and the occupation of Tyre was only effected by the
protection of Alexander’s naval allies, who forced an entrance into the
two harbors, and so drew off a portion of the defenders from the side
where the Greeks were making their attack. The stubborn defense cost
the Tyrians 8000 men, and of the prisoners 3000 were sold as slaves.
On the Macedonian side the loss was small, only amounting to 400 men,
but no mention is made of the losses of the allied fleets. The siege of
Tyre lasted seven months, the city falling in July, 332. The long delay
was worth while, for the successful issue showed how invincible was the
generalship of the Greek leader. By the possession of the city he held
the key to the control of the eastern Mediterranean.On the way south he met with no resistance except from the strong
citadel at Gaza, which withstood him for two months and was finally
taken by storm. The march to Egypt could now be safely undertaken,
as the whole sea coast from the Hellespont south was in the hands
of the Greeks. Egypt itself had no love for its Persian masters. It
had not long before been autonomous for fifty years, and it had been
brought back under the régime of the Great King under circumstances of
repression that made its inhabitants greet Alexander as a liberator.
The Persian governor, seeing the folly of resistance, gave up the
strong places, and Alexander passed the winter in the country. During
his stay he founded the only good harbor on the coast, the city which
still bears his name. This undertaking was not the boastful action of a
conqueror, solicitous of the praise of posterity; it was a keen-sighted
scheme to divert from the Phœnician towns of Syria the control of the
Mediterranean trade. Within half a century Alexandria had become a
great commercial emporium, the center of Greek science and learning,
and for three hundred years it continued to be the richest and largest
city in the world.As the members of the old Egyptian monarchy had proclaimed themselves
sons of Ammon, Alexander, in order to regularize his position in the
newly conquered province, made a visit to the temple of Zeus Ammon,
traveling across the desert with a small company of troops. He was
greeted by the priests of the temple as the divinely accredited ruler
of Egypt, but the exact words of the response of the oracle were not
communicated. They were kept as a mystery, but the divine honors
claimed afterwards by Alexander were always connected with this
mysterious attestation of his claim that his father was no earthly
parent, but Zeus himself.Darius, meanwhile, was in no position to interrupt this series of
successes in Syria and in Egypt. He had no army there prepared to
take the field, but he did try to interfere with the Greek lines
of communication in regions more remote from the present scene of
operations. Antigonus, left in Phrygia as its governor, was attacked
by a force composed of some of the soldiers who had fought on the
Persian side at Issus, as well as of contingents from Cappadocia
and Paphlagonia. But the attempt was unsuccessful. Antigonus showed
remarkable military ability, for with his small force he defeated the
Persians and added to the region under him the country of Lycaonia,
which had never submitted to Persian rule. In the spring of 331
Alexander left Egypt for his march to the interior of the Persian
Empire, and by the middle of the summer he crossed the Euphrates
near Thapsacus, and from there, taking a northerly direction through
Mesopotamia, he passed the Tigris on the 20th of September.The advance of the Greek army was continuous, little resistance being
offered to its progress. It seemed to be the aim of Darius to do
nothing to prevent Alexander from penetrating into the interior. If
the Greeks were defeated there, they would be cut off from retreat,
and in case the Persians again failed, there would be a chance for
the vanquished to withdraw in security to the mountainous country to
the north. Alexander has been criticised for delaying so long in his
occupation of Syria and Egypt; indeed Parmenio had urged him to accept
the terms offered by Darius after the battle of Issus, a suggestion
which called forth from Alexander the reply “that he would do it if
he were Parmenio.” But the small number of soldiers under his command
showed the strategy he followed to be as cautious as his conduct of the
expedition was daring. If he had gone straight on after the battle of
Issus, he would have been obliged to detach enough men from his main
army to act as a corps of observation in Syria and Egypt, and this
would have left him hardly more than 20,000 men.In the meantime he had received accessions of numbers, so that when he
came to confront Darius for the second time he had under his command
about 47,000 men. The engagement took place at Gaugamela (October, 331
B.C.), not far from the ruins of Nineveh. Darius had made some attempt
to give an improved armament to his foot soldiers, supplying them
with longer spears and swords so that they might fight the Macedonian
phalanx on more equal terms. Besides this, he had provided chariots
armed with scythes and a small number of elephants, which could be
effectively used only in a level country. But his chief hope lay in his
cavalry, of which he probably had 12,000, while Alexander had but 7000.The Greeks had had four days’ rest in a fortified camp before they
were drawn up in battle array, and besides this the ground between
them and the Persians had been carefully reconnoitered, in order to
discern if the enemy had constructed concealed pits to confuse the
cavalry charge. There was no way of protecting the flanks of the army,
so Alexander placed a reserve force behind with orders to move towards
the right or the left, according as the expected turning movement from
the Persians might develop. The Greeks moved forward on the 30th of
September, with Alexander leading the Macedonian heavy cavalry and the
bulk of the phalanx. He directed his attack against the enemy’s left
wing, but as he did so he was charged on the flank by the Scythian and
Bactrian horse. He sent against them the reserves previously mentioned,
and himself engaged the Persian infantry, who had lost heart when
they were attacked by the Macedonian cavalry. The manœuvers with the
scythe-bearing chariots did no damage, for the Greeks made way for them
to pass through their ranks, and re-formed again as soon as they had
rattled past. The onslaught of the phalanx proved irresistible; the
Asiatic foot could not withstand its superior armament and discipline.
The Persian center was broken and again Darius had the ignominious
experience of a headlong flight. The Persian cavalry, left to battle
alone, was soon demoralized and could not hold its ground.Parmenio’s experience with the left wing of the Greeks was different,
for he had difficulty in keeping his position against the Persian
horse. He could not follow Alexander’s advance, and hence there came
to be a great gap between the two positions of the army. In this open
space the Persians precipitated themselves; the Greek lines in battle
array were forced farther apart and their camp occupied. It was a
most dangerous position, but the barbarians, instead of using their
advantage, busied themselves in plundering the Greek camp. Alexander
turned from pursuing the Persian center to help the hard-pressed left
wing, and on his way met the enemy’s cavalry, now on their way back
with the booty of the Macedonian camp. He tried to cut them off from
their main body, but they fought with desperation and succeeded in
breaking through. In the hand-to-hand fights one of Alexander’s closest
friends, Hephæstion, was wounded.The danger to the left wing was now over, for the Persian commander
Mazæus, on hearing of his king’s flight, had ceased the attack on
Parmenio, who now occupied the Persian camp, while Alexander resumed
the pursuit of the main body, anxious to get Darius into his hands.
He marched with great rapidity, reaching on the day after the battle
Arbela, at which place the supplies and treasures of the flying
Persians were discovered. But the Great King had made good his escape
to Media, where, owing to the mountainous character of the country,
it was useless to pursue him farther. The results of the battle were
impressive materially and emotionally. The Persians had no heart to
continue the war. Their army was destroyed, 10,000 prisoners were in
the hands of their enemy, and the road to their capitals, Babylon and
Susa, lay open. All this had been won by Alexander at a small cost,
only 100 Macedonians having fallen, and the whole loss of the Greek
army did not exceed 500 men.Alexander marched to Babylon, which was surrendered without resistance
by its inhabitants, who welcomed him as a liberator. Religious
differences had made the citizens regard the Persians as oppressors,
and Alexander won over the Babylonians by acting as the protector of
their national religion. He rebuilt the Babylonian temples and also
showed a placable temper by keeping the Persian Mazæus as satrap of
the province of Babylonia. Without delaying at Babylon longer than was
necessary to conciliate the inhabitants, Alexander passed to Susa. Its
citadel offered no resistance, and with its surrender the town and
its treasury, amounting to 50,000 talents ($60,000,000), became the
property of the conqueror. (December, 331 B.C.)The next stage of the conquest of the interior of Asia was the
occupation of the country called Persis, the homeland of the Persians.
To reach it a difficult country held by Uxian hillmen had to be passed.
These were proud of their independence, for they had never paid tribute
to the Persians, and they now occupied their mountain defile, prepared
to dispute the passage of the Greeks. They were easily circumvented by
Alexander’s strategy, and brought to reason. Farther on, the access to
Persepolis was strongly defended by the Persians, but Alexander forced
his way through devious mountain roads and took the capital without
trouble. The national treasure, equivalent to 120,000 talents, fell
into his hands.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'Up to this point the march of Alexander had been through territories
which the Persians had themselves acquired by conquest, and which had
been long exploited by their satraps. The populations were, therefore,
not inimical to the new conquerors. Indeed, as we have seen in many
cases, the latter were greeted as deliverers from the heavy yoke of the
Persians. On its side, the Macedonian army had been kept under strict
discipline, and the lives and property of the people through whom it
had passed were carefully respected. But Persepolis was really in the
enemy’s country, the cradle of Persian rule, and there was no chance
of reconciling its inhabitants by kind treatment. They were now to
feel the brunt of real warfare. The city was given up to plunder, and
the royal citadel of the Achæmenian kings was burnt down in a drunken
revel. This ruthless act has been condemned, and it does appear to have
been the result of a moment of excess, not planned as part of a policy
of repression, for Alexander ordered the flames quenched, though he
himself had cast the first firebrand that had set the costly cedar work
of the palace in flames.These various military operations lasted far into the autumn. When
winter came the sorely tried and traveled Greeks took four months’
rest, and from this point begins another stage in the expedition, for
Persis was regarded as sufficiently pacified to allow the bulk of the
army to march into Media. Here Darius was preparing to make a last
stand, but his efforts to collect a new army had the somewhat pitiful
result of bringing to his standard a force of not more than 3000
horsemen and 6000 foot soldiers. As the Greeks approached, he fled
before them, recognizing the hopelessness of resistance. He seemed
minded to take refuge in the extreme limits of what had been his
empire, the province of Bactria. Without striking a blow, Alexander
occupied Ecbatana, the last of the great Persian capitals.All that now remained was to round off the conquest by capturing the
person of the defeated monarch, and to force the satraps of the eastern
provinces to accept the new régime. This program offered no serious
military problems, but it was bound to consume time and required
patience. Many of the non-Macedonian Greeks were now sent home, after
receiving generous rewards for their service, and Parmenio was left
at Ecbatana, while Alexander with the best of his troops set off to
pursue Darius. Hurrying on by Ragæ, a place a little to the south of
the modern capital of Persia, Alexander found there that the royal
fugitive had already passed through the Caspian Gates into the regions
of Parthia. Bactria was still much farther to the east. The followers
of Darius, with the exception of a few faithful Greek mercenaries,
determined to hand over their unlucky monarch as a prisoner to the
satrap of Bactria, Bessus, a kinsman of his, and to trust to his
initiative to organize a national resistance more effectively than
Darius.When Alexander, after a stay of several days at Ragæ, heard that his
old antagonist was a prisoner he hurried on, taking rest neither by
night nor by day, and finally came up with the barbarians, who now
preserved no semblance of discipline in their retreat. When Bessus and
the other conspirators saw Alexander approaching, they ordered Darius,
who was probably carried in a litter, to mount a horse and accompany
them. When he refused, they stabbed him and rode off. He was found
dying at a spring near the road, by a Macedonian soldier. By the time
Alexander reached the place the end had come. All that he could do for
his fallen foe was to throw his own cloak over the body and order it to
be sent with befitting honor to the queen mother. The last member of
the Persian monarchy, which had become a world power under Cyrus, was
buried in the royal tombs at Persepolis.
IV THE INVASION OF INDIA
The death of Darius did not delay the activity of Alexander; he was all
the more stirred to pursue Bessus when it was announced that the satrap
of Bactria was claiming to be the successor of Darius and had assumed
the insignia of royalty. But the regions close at hand had to be
pacified, so Parmenio was sent to occupy the country near the southwest
coast of the Caspian Sea. Alexander himself had to retrace his steps to
deal with a rebellious satrap who had previously sent in his submission.On the march southward, the province of Drangiana was taken without
resistance, but the conqueror’s stay at the capital, Prophthasia, was
marked by a mysterious tragedy. It was reported to Alexander that
Philotas, the son of Parmenio, was plotting against him. An assembly of
the Macedonian army was summoned, and the charges laid formally before
them. Philotas admitted that he had known of a plot to assassinate
Alexander, but had kept it secret. This reserve was treated as treason,
and Philotas was put to death by the soldiers. This semi-judicial act
was followed by the murder at Alexander’s command of his faithful
lieutenant, Parmenio, for which there was no excuse, as he had never
been charged with complicity in the guilty knowledge of his son.
But Alexander probably judged that the execution of Philotas would
inaugurate a blood feud familiar to Macedonian life, and he resolved to
take no chances.The road to Bactria selected by Alexander led him through modern
Afghanistan and across the Hindu Kush mountains. But first he turned to
the south in order to secure Seistan and the northwestern portion of
Baluchistan, known at that time as Gedrosia. The winter of 330-29 he
spent in the south of Seistan among a friendly people, the Ariaspæ, to
whom, on account of their hospitable reception, he granted autonomy.
Among the Gedrosians, their neighbors, he set up a satrapy, with a
capital at Pasa.In the spring, the Greek army pushed on to Arachosia, almost directly
south of Bactria, where the king founded another Alexandria, probably
on the site of the modern Candahar. At the foot of the high range of
the Hindu Kush, a complex mass of mountains which divides southern from
central, eastern from western Asia, called Paropanisus, the army passed
the winter, and yet another city, named after their leader, was founded
somewhere to the north of Cabul, Alexandria of the Caucasus. In the
early spring the difficult mountain ranges which protected Bactria were
crossed, the troops suffering much from the cold and from the lack of
food. They were obliged to subsist on raw meat and on herbs instead of
bread. After resting the army, Alexander led them on through an arid
plain to Bactria, the chief city of the satrapy. (329-28 B.C.)Bessus, the pretender, had tried to hinder the progress of the Greeks
by laying waste the country in front of them, but as soon as they drew
near, his horsemen deserted him and he fled across the Oxus. Alexander
lost no time in following him up. The pursuit carried him through
Sogdiana, where he crossed the Oxus on the rafts, made of inflated
skins, such as are still in use to-day. The river was passed at a point
where it was not a mile wide, at Kilif, and from thence the road was
taken to Maracanda, a town whose old name is now thinly disguised as
Samarcand. Bessus was deserted by his supporters, who thought that they
would be glad to secure peace by his surrender. They abandoned him, and
he was found by a division of the Greek army in a walled village, and
was finally sent in chains to Bactria, after Alexander had charged him
with the murder of Darius, his kinsman and benefactor.The ardor for annexing the Far Eastern division of the Persian Empire
to his rule spurred Alexander on, now that the rebellion of Bessus had
so unexpectedly failed. He purposed to make, not the Oxus, but the
Tanais his frontier on the northeast. The resistance seemed easily
overcome; the seven strongholds of the Sogdians were occupied, and on
the banks of the Jaxartes, or Tanais, at a point which is the gate of
communication between southwestern Asia and China, the pass over the
Tian-shan mountains, Alexander set the boundary of his conquests in
this direction, by founding a new city called Alexandria the Ultimate,
in later days Khodjend. While he was planning his new town, the country
rose in revolt, for the chieftains of Sogdiana had no mind to lose
their freedom. The small Macedonian garrisons left in the strongholds
a short time before were overpowered, and the city of Maracanda was
being besieged. The news of the revolt had spread far and wide, and
the various Scythian tribes were hurrying to join in driving out the
invaders. Alexander quickly recovered the strongholds, burning five of
them, but at Cyropolis there was stout resistance, and he received a
wound. The inhabitants of all were removed and forcibly transplanted as
citizens of the new Alexandria. (328 B.C.)It was not possible to go to the rescue of Maracanda because of the
threatening attitude of the Scythian tribes, who were preparing to
descend upon Alexandria, which was only separated from them by the
river Tanais. The danger of being rushed by these barbarous hordes was
imminent. The new city, therefore, was made capable of resistance; in
the short period of twenty days it was surrounded with walls of unburnt
clay. But Alexander determined also to strike terror by aggressive
action. He brought up to the banks of the river engines which threw
stones and darts among the enemy and forced them to retreat from the
stream. Then the Greek army crossed, and the Scythians were soon
routed. The king, with his cavalry, pursued them some distance in their
own territory. The heat was intense and Alexander was made dangerously
ill by drinking the water along the line of march.On his recovery he had to deal with a difficult revolt in Sogdiana,
again led by Spitamenes, who had figured in the previous uprising
and who this time had succeeded in cutting off a detachment of
Macedonian troops sent in pursuit of him. It is recounted that the
fear of a disaster made such a serious impression on the conqueror
that he covered the distance to Samarcand, over 150 miles, in three
days. Spitamenes did not wait to try conclusions with the Greeks, but
abandoned the siege, drawing off hurriedly in a westward direction,
closely pursued by Alexander.The Persian leader and his Scythian supporters were driven into the
wastes across the river Sogda, and Alexander, after ravaging the
province of Sogdiana, crossed into western Bactria and passed the
winter at Zariaspa, one of the chief cities of that region.While residing here, the trial of the pretender Bessus was begun. He
was condemned to mutilation and to die on the cross at Ecbatana. This
type of punishment was alien to Greek feeling and tradition, but it
is not necessary to say that Alexander’s apologists have argued the
necessity of conforming to the habits of Oriental races when they are
to be ruled successfully by outsiders. Alexander himself, as he had
never assimilated the best traditions of Greece, seemed ready enough to
adopt Oriental customs either to heighten his own dignity in Persia or
to impress the Persians that he was the legitimate successor of Darius.The colloquial axiom, “the longest way round is the shortest way home,”
can be applied to the science of government and politics, and it is
more than probable that the Hellenization of Asia would have had less
of the pinchbeck quality if Alexander had been trained in Sparta rather
than in Macedon. In any case, we know that his abandonment of the
homely traits characteristic of the relations between a Greek commander
and his soldiers made him unpopular, and that, especially, the favor
shown by him to the Persians who sided with him was distasteful to the
Macedonians. His execution of Parmenio savored of oriental despotism,
and during this winter there were open signs of discontent in the camp.
(328-27 B.C.)The winter quarters were changed to Maracanda on account of the
restlessness among the natives, and in the relaxation from the strict
discipline the soldiers and their leaders spent much of their time
in carousing. On one occasion when Alexander and his companions were
excited with wine, the king was made indignant at some slighting
reference to his military exploits made by his foster-brother Clitus,
who appealed to some verses of Euripides which signify that the army
does the work and the general reaps the glory. Alexander in his drunken
passion hurled a spear at the offender, and Clitus fell dead. The fatal
issue of this drunken quarrel was followed by three days’ passionate
remorse, and Alexander lay in his tent sleepless and refused food. The
fact that he had murdered his intimate friend could not be glossed over
even if the army were willing to exculpate their leader, by giving
Clitus a post-mortem trial, or by their ascribing the act to the
Dioscuri, whose festival was being celebrated at the time.The excitable temperament of Alexander, unfortunately, cannot always be
ascribed to intemperance in drink. He began to be intoxicated with the
idea that he was a semi-divine being, and he undertook to act the rôle
of an avenging deity, in executing a ruthless sentence of destruction
on a small Greek colony in Sogdiana, where dwelt the descendants of
the people of Branchidæ, who generations before had betrayed to the
Persians the treasures of a temple of Apollo not far from Miletus.
The act had never been forgotten, and now Alexander caused all the
inhabitants of the place to be massacred, and every vestige of it to be
destroyed. An action like this was alien to the spirit of free Greece,
and it marks the king’s progress in Oriental despotism. It is all the
more a witness to his personal degradation that the Milesian men in his
own army, to whom Alexander wished to leave the decision, could not
themselves agree on the fate of the Branchidæ, and hence the initiative
in the massacre was due to the savage sentiments of their leader.The pacification of Sogdiana took some time, owing to the rugged nature
of the regions in the southern part of the province, but the campaign
is chiefly noteworthy because it resulted in the marriage of Alexander
with Roxane, the daughter of a native chieftain who had gallantly
defended against the Macedonians a mountain fastness called the Sogdian
Rock. It had never been noted in the career of the youthful conqueror
that he was susceptible to the influence of women. Hence this sudden
attachment was as unexpected as it was unpopular in the army. They
disliked to have their king ally himself with an alien, and their lack
of sympathy was accentuated because Alexander chose to marry his bride
after the fashion of her country.The influence of the Oriental environment was seen also in the
introduction of Persian court ceremonial. The king desired to make the
custom of obeisance to royalty used by the Persians applicable also
to the Greeks. Callisthenes, a nephew of Aristotle, who was attached
to the army as official historiographer of the campaign, earned
Alexander’s resentment because he sturdily refused to adopt the Persian
ceremonial in the king’s presence. He was soon afterwards charged with
being involved in a plot to murder Alexander, which originated because
of the resentment held against the king by the royal pages, when one
of their number, Hermolaus, was flogged and reduced from his position
for a breach of etiquette in a boar hunt at which Alexander was
present. Callisthenes, apparently because he was an intimate friend of
Hermolaus and therefore assumed to be an accomplice in the plot, was
hanged.Three years had now passed since the death of Darius; Alexander had
done in the interior of Asia a work which no western conqueror has
accomplished since on so large a scale. Even to-day the effective
occupation by Russia of the lands once included in the Persian
Empire falls short of Alexander’s achievement, because Afghanistan,
included in his conquests, is still an autonomous state. It will have
been already noticed that much attention had to be given while the
Macedonian army was in these Far Eastern provinces, to their protection
against the nomad tribes on their frontiers. These operations in
Bactria and Sogdiana were a necessary part of the conquests of Persia,
since these remote provinces acted as a barrier against the savage
tribes of the central Asiatic steppes, who might at any time by joint
action overrun the civilization of the regions south of them. The
special care shown by Alexander in the construction of settlements
in this region is an evidence of his desire to make them centers of
civilizing influence by which the restless herdsmen might be trained to
orderly methods of life. The experiment failed, but it was a brilliant
vision--a vision which might have become a reality if the conqueror had
lived the normal span of years.The beating down of all opposition in the enormously extensive
empire which the defeat of Darius had laid at his feet had now been
accomplished. If Alexander had been a statesman and nothing else, he
would have stayed his hand, because the consolidation of the territory
he had overrun was a work demanding the time and the talents of the
greatest genius. But Alexander had not the temper of a Roman proconsul,
capable and zealous to solve large political problems. He was young
enough to be influenced by the spirit of adventure, and unlike Cæsar
and Napoleon, had sometimes no deeply laid scheme in his military
exploits.There was no political or military necessity summoning Alexander
to the conquest of India, but there was the irresistible charm of
novelty exerted by the unknown, the ambition to penetrate into
regions untrodden before by any Greek, and with this feeling of the
conqueror the modern world is able to sympathize. He was lured also by
the legendary stories of the visits to India of the god Dionysus and
the hero Herakles. The mystical, superstitious traits in Alexander’s
character could easily be stimulated, as we have already seen, to
emulation with the divinities of his people, and he was also glad to
afford proof that he could effect a conquest attempted without success
by Cyrus and Semiramis.The actual military difficulties of the undertaking were not great,
for though the Indians were brave and warlike, and though they had a
well-populated land to draw from, they were not a national unity. As
the Indian states were constantly at war with one another, there would
be an opportunity of securing allies in the peninsula. There was no
difficulty in securing recruits for the expedition, although it is true
a large detachment of the army had well-understood motives for desiring
to be left in Bactria; but some of the best Asiatic warriors from these
regions were enrolled, 30,000 in number, and the levies with which
Alexander now prepared to descend on India were certainly twice as
great as those with which he had left Macedon seven years before. His
army was now a great cosmopolitan community, an organism resembling the
mercenary armies of the Middle Ages, in the times of the Condottieri.
It was self-supporting and self-sufficient in more senses than one, for
it included artisans, engineers, physicians, diviners, literary men,
athletes, secretaries, clerks, musicians, as well as a host of women
and slaves.Most of the states in northern India at this time were inhabited by
what is often called an Aryan stock, the descendants of a succession
of waves of emigration through the northwestern hills from central
Asia. They had given up their nomadic life and reached the agricultural
stage. The Brahman caste system, with its asceticism, and with its
power of directive guidance in the state, according to the dictates of
a religious sect, already dominated the life of India, and the country
as a whole was made up of small principalities and village communities
with no common bond of union.Alexander effected his entrance into this new world by marching from
Nicæa (probably to be identified with Cabul) along the Cabul river and
then proceeded through the now well-known Khyber Pass. For the purpose
of securing his communications much time had to be spent in warfare
with the brave inhabitants of the Himalaya Mountains. Many fortresses
were taken, the most remarkable of these exploits being the capture of
the rock of Aormas, which probably lies on the right bank of the Indus,
some sixty miles above the junction of that river with the Cabul. The
two tribes whose resistance gave the most trouble were the Aspasians
and the Assacenes, dwelling in localities which can now be identified
as being parts of Chitral in the Pangkan and Swat valleys.This hard preliminary campaign lasted all the winter; in the spring
the Indus was crossed and a three days’ march was made eastward to
Taxila, a rich country, whose prince, along with lesser princes, gave
a friendly welcome to the conqueror. But this friendly attitude was
not taken by Porus, the ruler of the region farther south, who sent a
formal defiance to Alexander, and prepared to resist the invaders by
collecting an army of from thirty to forty thousand men. With this he
encamped on the river Hydaspes and prepared to contest its passage.
Alexander transported the boats, which he had constructed for crossing
the Indus, to the Hydaspes, and took up a position on the right bank
of the stream, near Jalalpur, in view of the army of Porus, who had
collected a large number of elephants, a formidable obstacle to the
effective use of the Greek cavalry. (326 B.C.)In the face of an enemy so placed the transit of the river was
impossible, for the edge of the stream was slimy, making an insecure
footing for the soldiers, and the horses, terrified by the presence
of the elephants, could not be kept in control and would certainly be
lost. Besides, Porus kept a sharp eye on all the fords near his camping
ground. Alexander kept the enemy busy by making various feints as if
he were about to attempt to pass the stream. It was the rainy season,
and the Indian soldiers and elephants were kept in battle array at the
threatened points, exposed for hours to the force of the wind and rain.
Porus began to think that the Greeks were afraid to force the passage,
and these manœuvers were continued until he was off his guard.Some sixteen miles below the Greek encampment, where the river made
a bend, there was a wooded island which hid the right shore from
observation. Taking advantage of this, and also of the fact that on his
side of the river there was a thick forest, Alexander managed to bring
his boats, which were made of skins, to a place opposite the island,
and at the same time he marched some of his troops down the stream,
leading them by a detour some distance from the bank, in order to
prevent the enemy from detecting his operations. The rest of the Greeks
were left at the original camping ground or were posted along the river
at different points, with directions to cross and aid him at the proper
moment.The actual crossing of the division under his command was done under
his own eyes. Regiments of heavy-armed men were left on the right
bank in anticipation of a possible rear attack by Abisares, prince of
Cashmir, who, it was known, had promised to assist Porus in resisting
the invading army. The passage was facilitated by the stormy weather
which prevailed during the night. The Indian outposts heard nothing,
and Alexander led the way safely past the island to the opposite shore,
where, though some difficulty was caused by mistaking an islet for the
mainland, the cavalry were disembarked and put in battle array. The
whole number of troops under Alexander’s command were 6000 hypaspists,
4000 light-armed foot, 5000 cavalry, including 1000 Scythian archers.
In the meantime the Indian outposts had ridden away to announce to
Porus what had happened and to prepare him for the news of the Greek
advance. Alexander went swiftly forward, taking with him all the
cavalry, and he soon met and defeated a detachment of 1000 Indian
horsemen and 160 chariots under the command of the son of Porus.The Indian king himself was advancing with the bulk of his army, and he
drew up his line of battle as soon as he found a piece of sandy ground
suitable for displaying the cavalry and elephants. In front he placed
200 elephants at intervals of 100 feet, and behind them his infantry
to the number of 20,000. In the wings his cavalry were drawn up, about
4000 in all. Alexander placed the pick of his army, the hypaspists,
immediately in front of the elephants. The use of these animals in
battle was still a strange sight to the Greeks, and the Indian fighting
line seemed to them like a city wall with towers. Porus did not think
that his foes would venture to advance through the spaces left between
the elephants. He argued that the horses would be terror-stricken and
the foot would be met by the Indian foot soldiers if they tried to
attack the elephants from the side, and that they would hesitate to
move directly against them for fear of being trodden down by their
onslaught.Exactly how the Indian infantry were armed is left uncertain. They
probably had not the solidity of the Greek phalanx and were depended
upon only to cover the work of the elephants. Alexander kept his
infantry in reserve until he was able to confuse the line of the enemy
by a cavalry attack. His cavalry he directed to spread out and attack
not only in front but on the flanks as well. This manœuver was executed
with practised precision, and neither the Indian chariots nor their
horse could withstand the furious onslaught of the Greek squadrons,
and soon retired behind the elephants with the Macedonians in close
pursuit. As the elephants wheeled round, passing through the infantry
in order to meet the Macedonians, the quick advance was blocked; the
horses could not be induced to charge. They were obliged to retire;
then Porus, on his side, vigorously attacked both the Macedonian
cavalry and the phalanx.The fight was now a general one. The Greek authorities paint this stage
of the battle in superlative diction, describing how the elephants
pressed through the thickly packed masses in front of them, rending and
trampling the soldiers and horses as they went, while the engines on
their backs scattered destruction far and wide. But the Macedonians
finally won by striking down the elephants’ drivers and destroying the
turrets they were in, and so wounded the beasts themselves that they
ceased to attack. With the elephants rendered useless, the chance of
victory for the Indians was gone. Their infantry was not sufficiently
disciplined to make any use of the confusion caused in the Greek ranks
by the work of the elephants. Besides, the Macedonian cavalry had in
the first stage of the engagement got so far into the Indian lines,
that they remained not only on the field of battle, but actually were,
as the engagement advanced, behind both the enemy’s infantry and the
elephants as well. When the Indian cavalry tried to take a hand in
the fight and leave the part of the field where the elephants were in
action, the Greek horse, having a superiority in numbers, forced them
back.The Greek infantry phalanx had been ordered by Alexander to keep its
ground, but when the cavalry fight made it impossible for the Indians
to move forward, the Greek foot soldiers drew away from their first
position, where they were liable to a frontal attack by the elephants,
and driving the elephants back, exposed the enemy to an attack by the
Macedonian horse. Unprotected as the Indians were on both sides, they
could not escape defeat, and at this point of the battle they suffered
severely; most of the elephants and King Porus himself were taken
prisoners.The Greek historian, Arrian, says that the Macedonian loss was only 310
dead, mostly horsemen; but as other authorities add 700 foot soldiers,
it seems likely that the battle was a stubborn one, for there were
only 11,000 men engaged in Alexander’s army. The fact, too, that the
use of elephants became customary in the wars fought by Alexander’s
successors, some of whom were present at the battle of Hydaspes,
proves that the fight with Porus must have made an impression on his
opponents, and this places it in a different category from the easier
victories over the Persians. Alexander treated his defeated antagonist
with magnanimity and erected his kingdom into a vassal state; but
as safeguards of his loyalty, directed that two garrison cities,
Bucephala and Nicæa, should be established in his domains, one on
either side of the Hydaspes near the site of the battle. A lieutenant,
Crateros, was left to carry out these building plans, while Alexander
turned to the conquest of the neighboring tribes. The only notable
difficulty was the taking of the town of Sangala, the chief citadel of
the free and warlike Cathæans, which had been strongly fortified and
which had to be taken by storm.The general result was that the Punjab was annexed to Alexander’s
empire and placed in the hands of vassal princes. From this region
the Greek army advanced to the river Hyphasis, reaching it at a point
higher up than its junction with the Sutlej. This was the extreme limit
of Alexander’s march. He would have gladly gone farther, for the whole
of India might well have become a subject state; but the army had
suffered from the discomforts of the rainy season, and they were weary
of campaigning. The horses were worn out, the armor and accoutrements
in bad condition. The temper of the troops, devoted though they were
to their commander, left no doubt that they would mutiny if Alexander
refused to turn back. He told the officers he would go on himself, and
that they could return to Macedonia and let the Macedonians know that
they had abandoned their king in a hostile land.But appeals and threats alike failed to convince the army that their
view of the situation was unreasonable. The sacrifices were found to be
unfavorable, and persuaded by this intimation of the disfavor of the
gods, the king consented to return. On the bank of the Hyphasis twelve
altars were erected of large size, as lofty as the walls of a city, to
mark the limits of Macedonian conquests, and as a thank-offering to the
gods for their protection through the hazards of long-continued warfare
in strange lands. The army then retired to the Hydaspes.Alexander was an explorer as well as a conqueror, and his
disappointment at this enforced withdrawal from the prosecution of his
march must have been that of a man who was within reach of the goal and
just failed to attain it. According to the geographical notions of his
day, he was near the certain limit of the world; he knew nothing of the
great Indian peninsula, and of course nothing of the vast extent of
Siberia or the Chinese Empire. He supposed that the Ganges flowed into
an eastern sea which was continuous with the Caspian and which washed
the shores of Scythia and the base of the high mountains he had lately
passed through. On the river Hydaspes, a fleet had already been under
construction; as soon as it was ready he embarked on it a part of his
best troops, while the mass of the army, in two divisions, moved down
the stream. The route followed was along the Hydaspes to its confluence
with the Akesines, then down this stream to the Indus and the Indus
itself to the Delta.From the military point of view, this concluding stage of the Indian
expedition offers little of special interest. The inhabitants of the
country either submitted to or fled from the Greek army, and various
strongholds were taken by storm. In an assault on one of them, held
by the Malians, who dwelt in the southern Punjab, the king, who had
pressed forward in the midst of the enemy, found himself separated
from the main body of his followers and was dangerously wounded. In
the region the army traversed several colonies were founded; another
Alexandria rose at the point where the Akesines flows into the Indus,
and at Pattala a harbor and navy yard were built. The conquered portion
of India was organized in three satrapies, one of which was under
Porus, who had a free position as a vassal prince, for in his territory
there were no Macedonian garrisons.But the real subjugation of the country had not been effected by the
spectacular march through it; as soon as the Greeks turned their backs,
an uprising took place. Before the whole army reached Pattala, a part
had been detached with directions to march west to Arachosia, and to
wait in Caramania till it was joined there by the main division. The
fleet was placed under the command of Nearchus, a Cretan, who was
to take it along the coast of the Indian Ocean and finally into the
Persian Gulf. Alexander, at the head of the rest of the army, took the
road through Gedrosia.The difficulties of the return were considerable. The men under
Alexander suffered terribly in passing a desert country before they
reached, after sixty days’ slow progress, the capital of Gedrosia,
Pura. In the farther stretch to Caramania there was also exhausting
work, but these trials marked the end of the expedition, for Crateros,
who had led the rest of the troops by Arachosia, soon arrived, and news
came of the landing of the fleet after a skilfully managed cruise of
seventy-five days through unknown waters on the coasts of Caramania. A
year had now passed (325 B.C.) since the beginning of the return home
from India. During the course of the winter the army returned to Susa,
thus concluding this remarkable adventure of Far Eastern conquest.
V ALEXANDER’S EMPIRE
It had now been five years, from the summer of 330, since Alexander
had left Ecbatana in pursuit of Darius. His presence was urgently
needed, for the government of the empire was in chaotic state so far
as the central administration was concerned. Fortunately the attempts
at an uprising had generally been feeble, and were easily and loyally
suppressed by the satraps where they did occur. Only one gave trouble,
a revolt in Bactria, initiated first of all by Greek mercenaries and
taken up by the native inhabitants as far as the border of Scythia.
This lasted some time, and peace was not restored until after
Alexander’s death.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'But the maladministration of the conquered provinces was more serious
than these uprisings. During Alexander’s absence in the Far East there
had been boundless liberty in the financial plundering of the people.
Peculation was the rule everywhere, and it was common to the Persian
official class, to whom the government of the satrapies had been
intrusted. Trained as these officers had been in maladministration and
corruption, they had no notion of following different standards, simply
because there was a different ruler. While Alexander was in Bactria he
had been forced to deprive several satraps of their governments. It was
time for the strong arm of the king to be felt, and there was no doubt
about his intentions and aims. Many Persian satraps were executed and
their places taken by Macedonian officers. But while Alexander had been
away the infection had spread to European office-holders, both military
and civil. We hear, for example, of the death penalty being inflicted
on Greek commanders of the troops in Media, who had plundered graves
and temples and had signalized their rule over the subject population
by systemic oppression.Among the guiltiest of this class was the minister of finance,
Harpalus, who treated the state’s money as his private property, had
brought over from Athens a company of gay comrades, and was living the
easy, reckless life of an Oriental satrap. His previous record had been
anything but clean; before the battle of Issus he had been obliged to
return to Greece and had only come back to Asia because he had received
the royal pardon. He knew that there was no chance of finding the king
amenable to excuses or explanations; so with 5000 talents taken from
the treasury, he raised a body of 6000 mercenaries and departed for
the sea coast, hoping to stir up a revolt. The scheme was a pitiable
failure; no satrap held out a hand to him; and finally Harpalus sailed
to Athens, where he had influence and could count on a welcome, because
of the strong anti-Macedonian feeling in the city.Alexander showed his appreciation of the lesson of Harpalus’ official
career by ordering the governors of the provinces to dismiss all
soldiers they had collected on their own authority. Now that the
period of military expansion was closed, the king devoted himself to
the organization of the empire, following the lines he had worked out
originally, which tended to the amalgamation of the Greek and Persian
elements. This ideal survived the experience of maladministration,
and Alexander held fast to it, despite the opposition of the officers
of his army. He seems to have believed firmly in the possibility of
educating politically the Asiatic peoples so that they could be ruled
without display of despotic power, and he was just as firm in trusting
to the loyalty of the Persian ruling class to carry out this program
of interracial conciliation. In doing so he failed to take account of
the Persian’s deep-rooted dislike of the Greeks, which with Oriental
wiliness his new subjects could conceal, but which was ever present as
an inducement to them to take advantage of the first opportunity that
offered to throw off the yoke imposed upon them by the conquest.Alexander planned to make his scheme a success by marrying the
daughters of the Persian official class to the Macedonian officers. He
led the way by claiming, as the successor of the Great King, the right
to have more than one legitimate wife, and after his return from India
he added to his royal household a daughter of Darius, Stateira, and a
daughter of Ochus, Parysatis. Alexander’s close friend, Hephæstion,
received another daughter of Darius, and altogether eighty of the high
officers in command of the Macedonian army were married to Persian
women of high degree. The wedding festivities were made a national
affair, and took place at Susa on the same day with great ceremonial,
all the brides receiving from Alexander marriage portions. The
Macedonian private soldiers, who followed the example of their chief on
this occasion, were richly rewarded.It is said that the officers were as dissatisfied with the matrimonial
schemes of the king as they had been with his plans for further
conquest in India; in any case, it is known that on the king’s death
there was a general movement among them to get rid of their Persian
helpmates. The discontent among the rank and file of Alexander’s
followers with his program of social equality between Greek and Persian
could not be appeased, even when he paid their debts at the time of the
“Union of the Two Races” festival, an act of bounty which cost him
about $5,000,000. The hostility to Persian influence was accentuated by
the introduction of foreign troops into the army. This was naturally a
step required by the necessity of raising a force greater than Greece
could possibly supply. That thinly populated country must have been
already drained to the point of exhaustion by the demands already made
upon it to fill up the losses during the years of constant campaigning.
And as a matter of fact, we know that a year and a half after the
passage of the Hellespont with 35,000 men, Alexander led to battle at
Arbela about 60,000, and in the years during which the expedition was
moving in the Far East, the various additional troops must have equaled
altogether 50,000 men. The substitution of Persian contingents for
Greek soldiers was a matter of plain necessity. They received lower
pay, they cost less to feed, without considering the saving made in the
high cost of transportation of bodies of men from continental Greece to
the interior of Asia.Orders had therefore been given to draw 30,000 young men from the
conquered provinces and to prepare them for military services according
to Macedonian methods. A further and more radical stage in the
amalgamation policy was reached when Persians were enrolled in the
Macedonian phalanx and Asiatic horsemen in the élite regiment of the
Hetæroi; even in the life guards distinguished Persians were received,
and the command of that force was assigned to a warrior from Bactria,
Hystaspes.These leveling measures were more than the Macedonian veterans could
endure, and they became openly mutinous when Alexander proposed to
dismiss those who had been longest in the service. The whole army stood
together and told the king that they would serve no longer, and that he
would see how he could do without them, now that he had his Persians
to serve under him. Alexander then set to work to organize purely
Persian regiments on the Macedonian model, a Persian life guard, a
Persian squadron of Hetæroi, and a Persian phalanx. This satisfied the
Macedonians, and they were farther placated by being given precedence
over the various Persian units of the army. Under these conditions,
the veterans were willing to be dismissed, and they received one
talent as a bonus and full pay until they were actually on Macedonian
soil. Moreover, the king agreed to provide for the education of their
children. Ten thousand men on these terms returned to Greece.A more effective means for bringing together the two races on an equal
footing was the establishment of military colonies throughout the
empire. At an early stage of the expedition this had been adopted as
the readiest way of keeping peace in the conquered territory. Tyre
and Gaza, after the native population had been sold into slavery,
received a new population of Greek origin. We have already noted the
extension of this scheme in the Far Eastern provinces and in India.
Altogether seventy cities are said to have been founded by Alexander.
These colonies, though primarily intended for military purposes, became
centers of industrial communication and of civilization. The case of
the Egyptian Alexandria is so well known that it does not require to
be stressed. Less familiar are the proofs of Alexander’s sagacity as a
founder of flourishing towns in other parts of his empire. Alexandria,
on the Persian Gulf, continued through the whole period of antiquity to
be the greatest emporium of the whole region of Mesopotamia. Alexandria
in Arcia (Herat) and Alexandria in Arachosia (Candahar) are still
to-day important towns in Persia.Despite his absorption in military interests, Alexander found time
for looking after the economic development of his empire. The Indian
Ocean was opened to commerce by the remarkable voyage of Nearchus which
concluded the Indian expedition. Attempts were made to circumnavigate
the Arabian peninsula, and, though they failed, yet a considerable
portion of the coast was explored. The Caspian Sea was also the scene
of exploring adventures, because it was supposed to be a part of the
vast ocean by which the earth was surrounded. The Tigris was freed
from obstruction and made navigable; the ancient irrigation canals in
Babylonia were restored; and a beginning was made in constructing a
harbor near Babylon.Equally farsighted was Alexander’s foundation of a unified monetary
system for the empire. Under Persian rule the custom had been for the
satraps to coin silver money, while the coinage of gold was reserved
to the Great King. The result was that each province followed its own
customs and financial chaos prevailed. Alexander reserved the minting
privilege to the general government; even where provincial coining was
permitted, the coins were of the same general type and bore the name of
the king. The only exception to this rule is found in the case of the
autonomous Greek cities on the western coast of Asia. This new monetary
system was based on that of the Athenians; the bimetallic basis, as
it had existed in the Persian Empire, was abandoned and the silver
standard, as used at Athens and Corinth, took its place. The reformed
monetary system of Alexander continued down to Roman times.The large hoards of precious metals, which fell into Alexander’s hands
during the course of his conquests, not only gave occupation to his
mints, but also freed him from financial anxiety. He had begun the
expedition in a state of insolvency, for he had a debt of 1300 talents
with only seventy in his war chest to cover it. The maintenance of the
army required a monthly expenditure of 200 talents, and to this 100
talents had to be added for the fleet. The provinces in western Asia,
the first fruits of his victories, could not supply a sum so large, and
it was lack of money which caused Alexander to give up his fleet in
the autumn of 334. After the battle of Issus and the conquest of the
rich province of Egypt, there was soon a surplus where there had been a
deficit, and Alexander was able to send considerable sums of money to
Antipater to help him out in his campaign in Greece.Rich as were the Persian treasures, they were heavily and constantly
drawn upon by the ever-developing military needs of the conqueror.
The whole force under arms, including the very numerous garrisons,
must have equaled 100,000 men. This meant at least an expense of
7000 talents; to this large sum must be added the drains caused
by Alexander’s generosity, by official peculation such as that of
Harpalus, and by the gifts to old soldiers, who were richly rewarded.
The royal household, which was organized on the Persian model, was most
expensive; the royal table alone costing 600 talents. Of course, the
receipts were large, probably from fifteen to twenty thousand talents
annually, but Alexandria’s budget was far from balancing; and at the
time of his death, there were contained in all the treasuries of the
empire only 50,000 talents, about $70,000,000, a small sum when the
size of the empire is taken into account.In administering his domains, Alexander showed great conservatism; he
made few changes, he allowed each of the countries which acknowledged
the Great King as its overlord to retain its particular institutions.
One important modification he did introduce into the loosely organized
and haphazard Persian system of rule, the division of power. The
Persian satrap was generally the sole governor, having in his hands the
civil, military, and financial administration. Alexander limited him to
matters of internal administration, appointing a financial officer and
a military commander armed with considerable powers. After the return
from India, there was a further innovation made by the appointment of
a Chiliarch, as the supreme director and head of the provinces, with
a place immediately after the monarch himself. This official was a
part of the governmental machinery of the Persian Empire, holding in
it the place of a Grand Vizier. It was given to Alexander’s friend,
Hephæstion, but after his death it was left vacant. The most trusted
servant, the actual head of the administration, was the Chief Secretary
Eumenes from Cardia, a man of first-rate military and civil capacity;
he was unfailingly loyal to his master, and after Alexander’s death,
suffered many vicissitudes because of his devotion to the Macedonian
royal house.Alexander was not satisfied with the rôle of conqueror; he wished to
give his rule in the East that trait of legitimacy which the popular
Oriental mind required as a stimulus to its loyalty. It was impossible
for him to be King of Persia by the grace of God, for it was the might
of his own hand, not the right of succession, that constituted him the
heir of Darius. This Gordian knot of politics he solved in his own
direct fashion by directing that divine honors should be paid to him
by the subject populations. The custom of apotheosis originated in
Egypt, but it was not alien to Greek thought, according to which no
deep distinction existed between man and divinity. The mythical heroes
of the Greek people, whom all allowed to have once been men, were
everywhere honored with altars and sacrifice. Asclepius and Herakles
sat on Olympus with the greater divinities of a purely spiritual
origin. It had become not unusual in the age preceding Alexander
to accord divine honors to the living. Such had been the case with
Clearchus of Heracleia who had been greeted as the son of Zeus, and
with Dionysius the Younger who had caused himself to be honored at
Syracuse as the son of Apollo. Alexander’s achievements, far greater in
comparison, gave him a right to this distinction during his lifetime;
his divine origin had, besides, been attested by the Erythrian Sibyl
and by the oracle at Branchidæ; with this theological and official
stamp all that remained to be done was to give the accepted belief a
concrete form. The cult of the conqueror became a part of the state
religion in the Greek communities throughout the empire. Whether
Alexander took the initiative in this form of adulation we do not know;
he certainly did not discourage it, and on his return from India he
did not reject the adulatory form of congratulation expressed by many
Greek states, who instead of sending formal deputations, presented
the so-called “theories” usual when the festivals of the gods were
celebrated. Athens at first resisted this form of transcendent
courtesy, but finally, in order to avoid offending Alexander, it was
resolved in the year 324 to enrol the conqueror among the gods of
the city under the designation of Dionysus. So this debasing custom
took root in Greece; the monarch became, by a noxious fiction,
differentiated from the rest of mortals, and the infection spread
from Greece to Rome, and later on became crystallized in Christian
civilization, through the example of the Byzantine court, and under the
form of monarchy by divine right has not yet disappeared.After the dismissal of the veterans from the army at Opis, Alexander
withdrew from the plains of the Tigris, and according to the custom of
the Persian monarchs spent the summer in the highlands of Media. He
passed the time in relaxation; nautical and athletic festivals were
held, in which celebrities from Greece took part. When the cooler
weather began, there were expeditions to repress the bandit hill-tribes
who dwelt between Ecbatana and Susa, people whom the Persians had never
succeeded in bringing under control. Afterwards, the king returned
to Babylon, where he received deputations from the Greek states and
even from Italy. It was thought that an expedition to the west was
being planned. But the king preferred to give his immediate attention
to Arabia and, by conquering it, to open at last a direct road of
communication between the interior of Persia and Egypt.By June both the fleet and army were ready to start. A great banquet
was given in honor of Nearchus, the admiral who was to undertake the
adventurous voyage from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. The king
withdrew from the feast and spent the rest of the night in a carouse
with a friend, Medius. He rose late in the morning and another night
was spent in excessive drinking. The following day he was attacked with
fever; he could not walk and had to be carried on a couch to the altar,
to make the customary sacrifices. He spent the day discussing the plans
of the expedition with Nearchus. In the evening he had himself conveyed
across the river to a garden villa, hoping for relief from its quiet
isolation. But for six days the fever continued, the king being able
only to attend the sacrificial ceremonial. His condition grew worse,
and he was taken back to the palace; he slept a little, but the fever
did not abate, and when his officers visited him, they saw that he had
lost the power of speech. There was confusion among the soldiers, for
it was rumored that their leader was dead; they clamored to be let into
the palace, and passing by the bodyguard they circled past the bed
of the dying monarch; but he was not able to speak and only signified
by movements of his hands and eyes that he recognized them. Some of
those about him spent the night in the temple of Serapis, awaiting an
indication of the god that he might be transported to the temple as he
lay and be healed by divine help. But they were warned, it is said, by
a voice that he was not to be moved, and on the evening of June 13th he
died, before he had completed his thirty-third year.During the years of Alexander’s conquests, the history of the Greek
states sinks into insignificance. After the battle of Issus all hope
of defeating Macedon by a combination with Persia was abandoned. The
confederacy sent congratulations, and only Sparta stood aloof. Its
king, Agis, even ventured to declare war, but, after a few small
successes, he was defeated in the battle of Megalopolis, losing his
life in the field. Sparta then sent hostages to Alexander and was
generously treated. Later on he interfered again in the affairs of
Greece by directing the confederation to take back the Greek exiles,
20,000 in number, and so mark his overlordship by an era of good
feeling. Only two states objected, Athens and Ætolia.The only exciting incident in continental Greece was connected with
the flight of the faithless finance minister, Harpalus, who came to
the coast of Attica with 5000 talents, a body of mercenaries, and
a considerable fleet, hoping to stir up a revolt. But the Athenian
politicians were too cautious to be drawn into an intrigue which would
certainly have proved dangerous. They seized Harpalus and took his
treasure, proposing only to surrender this money to officers expressly
sent by Alexander. Half the money taken disappeared and there was no
official record made of the sum received. Demosthenes was involved
in the scandal, and he emerged from it with a besmirched reputation.
Harpalus escaped and was soon afterwards murdered. Demosthenes was
condemned, imprisoned, and escaped. But Greek feeling was not sensitive
about a case where it was plain that a man had appropriated stolen
money for the good of the state, and Demosthenes was praised as a
patriot.Alexander’s conquests, both in method and in achievement, were but the
elaboration of the groundwork laid down by Philip his father. The army
that conquered Persia and invaded India was trained in the campaigns of
continental Greece, and without this preliminary training in Europe,
its spectacular successes in Asia would not have been possible. Up to
the time of Philip of Macedon, warfare in Greece had achieved only
negative results. It was not systematized, no extensive imperial rule
had come to the victors through any of the decisive battlefields, for
these military successes were never followed up by a consistent scheme
of conquest. Philip changed all this, and he brought his developed army
and his new political policy into close connection. Demosthenes himself
remarked this contrast, for he said that King Philip fought his wars
not only with a phalanx of heavy-armed men, but with light infantry,
archers, and cavalry.The old campaigning schedule, which consisted in ravaging the enemy’s
territory for a few months, a set battle in the open country, and
a withdrawal to winter quarters, was no longer observed. If the
Macedonian king did not find his enemy in the field, he besieged his
towns, using siege engines to bring him to terms. Summer and winter
were alike used for operations when the old array of citizen amateur
soldiers had given place to the professional fighters. Alexander’s
victories were won not only on the battlefield, but through the quick
following up of his victories; the enemies’ power of resistance was
annihilated by the rapidity with which a defeated army was pursued and
never allowed a chance to gather itself together again after it was
beaten. These cavalry marches in the rear of a retreating enemy, or the
suddenly delivered attacks on a foe preparing to resist, attacks made
irrespective of mountains and deserts, were as military achievements no
less remarkable than the set battles and the sieges of strongly walled
cities and citadels. Supremely characteristic of Alexander’s strategy
was the pursuit after the battle of Gaugamela, when numbers of horses
fell on the road from exhaustion.As a general, Alexander did great deeds and did them in an heroic
style. He was a warrior distinguished by personal bravery, filled with
the ardor of combat, eager to be in the thickest of the fight, and
yet the physical passion of the fighter in no way dulled the acute
intelligence of the general, or made him indifferent to the mastery of
details in preparing for battle or in following a victory up after it
had been won. He showed strategical knowledge in approaching the enemy
and knew how to overcome the natural difficulties in his way. So we
see him unhesitatingly marching through narrow defiles and organizing
different classes of troops according to the changing conditions which
confronted him. He showed high capacity in selecting his base, in
looking after his communications, in providing for and provisioning his
men. When all was ready, and not before, these cautious provisions gave
place to the impetuous onslaught in battle and the untiring pursuit
of the defeated enemy. But the duties of generalship, complicated as
they were, were not allowed to interfere with the “joy of fighting.”
Alexander in every fight led his cavalry in person; whenever a breach
was made in a fortification he was in the first rank; whenever a town
was taken he was the first to scale the wall.He seemed instinctively to have taken in the significance of the
enlarged scale on which warfare under him was conducted. He had
to solve untried problems, due to the vast extent of territory he
traversed, so different in every way from the restricted limits of
continental Greece. The students of strategy have especially admired
his originality in the systematic following up of a victory, an element
in successful warfare not dreamed of by the citizen generals of Greece.
In the Peloponnesian war it never occurred to the Spartans when they
had defeated the Athenians to besiege Athens. But after Issus, a most
decisive victory, Alexander showed the utmost resourcefulness in the
long seven months’ siege of Tyre, and finally took it by storm. The
same mobility of generalship is noted in India, where he did not
hesitate in the face of a division of elephants, an unknown arm in
warfare, to cross a river and deliver a frontal attack.The army, which never failed to respond to the ever-developing visions
and schemes of its commander, until he had carried it to the eastern
limits of the known world in his career of conquest, was at the very
beginning of Alexander’s career trained for any military project he
might propose. It was composed of seasoned officers and men, who
had proved their mettle and gained their laurels under Philip while
he was bringing his army to the highest pitch of excellence. In the
list of great Greek military leaders, Philip is placed by the side of
Epaminondas, the Theban, the man who revolutionized the Greek art of
warfare by a fine stroke of genius. It had been noted that in the Greek
battles, where the phalanx had become the controlling factor, its right
wing was frequently victorious in both opposing armies. This phenomenon
was simply due to the fact that the Greek heavy-armed soldier carried
a shield on his left arm and naturally tended to move in an oblique
direction towards the right hand. The chief innovations introduced by
Epaminondas were the strengthening of the left wing by increasing its
depth--it was made fifty men deep--and the holding back of the right
wing as the whole phalanx advanced in battle array. With the increased
depth of the phalanx, the front was necessarily shortened, and in order
to prevent flanking operations, Epaminondas made great use of cavalry,
in protecting the flanks of his men from an encircling movement on
the part of the enemy, whose phalanx, since it was not so deep (being
the old shape), would stretch out on both sides beyond the lines of
the Theban line. As a general, Philip accepted these new tactical
principles originated by Epaminondas, and applying them to Macedonian
conditions, made of the Macedonian army a wonderfully effective
military machine.Macedonia was peopled by peasants and herdsmen, and up to Philip’s time
they were an untrained mass, insufficiently armed, not able to contend
with the armies of the rest of Greece. There was a landed aristocracy
in Macedon, forming a special warrior class, who fought as cavalry.
Using these elements and adding to them Greek mercenaries, King Philip
had created a military force far superior to any that Greece had ever
seen before.The Greek cavalry moved in loose formation, the horsemen wore armor,
and as arms they had a shield, sword, and spear, the spear being used
rather for throwing than for striking, as is the case with the modern
lance, with the whole momentum of the moving mass, man and horse.
The troops of the Macedonian cavalry, formed of the nobles of the
land, were called the followers of the king, “Hetairoi.” They bore a
shield and a spear for casting or thrusting, and a sword, and were
always given a crucial position in an engagement. As contrasted with
Greek cavalry generally, the Macedonians showed superior training
and discipline; they moved together and behaved in a fight, not as
individual warriors, but as tactical units, and were controlled in
their movements by a single will. Such development of cavalry was
unfamiliar to the Greek republics, which confined themselves to the
technical training of the phalanx.The Macedonian foot were the special creation of Philip, and were
named by him “the followers on foot.” They fought in the ordinary
phalanx formation, but closer together than was usual, and used long
spears, so that several lines were enabled at once to engage in actual
hand-to-hand fighting. The spear was so constructed as to weight,
thickness, and length that it could reach the opposing line and yet
be firmly grasped. The ordinary spear was somewhat over six feet in
length, but the Macedonian phalanx depended for its success not so much
on man-to-man fighting as on the irresistible impact of the whole. When
it was acting on the defensive, it was virtually impenetrable. Its
disadvantage was in its lack of individual initiative; the soldiers
were machines rather than fighting men. It was heavy in its movements
and could be thrown into disorder more easily than the older Greek
phalanx with its looser formation. The élite corps, the hypaspists,
were more lightly armed than the men in the phalanx, and so moved more
freely. In Alexander’s battles they were the connecting link between
the cavalry and heavy mass of the phalanx, which advanced slowly
forward. As managed by Alexander, these various arms seem to have
worked admirably together, all sharing in the activity of a general
offensive movement. It should be added that Alexander was also indebted
to his father for much of the advance made in the art of besieging. He
constantly used siege engines, and we have noticed how much he depended
on their successful employment at Tyre and Halicarnassus.Posterity has justly selected the epithet “great” as most fitting
to be coupled with Alexander’s name, and he has this honor for more
than one reason. It is perhaps less contested than in the case of
any other of the world’s leading personalities, Charles the Great
alone excepted, for Charles, like Alexander, introduced a new age of
the world’s history. Great as were the successes of Alexander, they
constitute less of a claim on the personal admiration of posterity than
his knightly qualities as a warrior, and the charm and impetuosity of
youth. His great victories were won between the years of twenty-one and
twenty-five. In the space of thirteen years there are crowded together
events and achievements that would exalt the longest life of the
greatest man.His sudden and premature death did him a kind of poetic justice,
because his temperament cannot be coupled consistently with the
characteristics of old age or even with the middle period of man’s
life. His body and his brain had been under a tremendous pressure,
which even a strong constitution could not resist. It was this restive
youthfulness that spurred him on to adventures which were purposeless
when looked at from the point of view of the mature statesman, such
as the expedition to India, an uncalculated move not to be understood
except as due to the stimulus of an explorer’s curiosity and the desire
to accomplish a feat unheard of before.The impulsiveness and emotionalism of Alexander in combination with his
military genius produced results unprecedented in history. His career
is that of a Homeric hero on a larger stage. It is not surprising that
his conquests almost defy criticism and make a personal estimate seem
artificial. He did so much that it apparently makes little difference
what he was, for his actions speak for themselves, and they tell
their tale like a fairy story, without any need of analysis. It is
obviously unfair to look for constructive statesmanship in a career so
short, when almost every month was occupied with military campaigns
either planned or in execution. When his life was ended, Alexander was
still a young man with a fresh and vigorous intelligence, open to new
impressions. It is hazardous to infer (as Grote does) that he would
have spent his life in acts of military aggression or that he would
have sunk to the position of an Oriental despot, little differing from
the Persian kings to whose title he succeeded. It is safer to put aside
these pessimistic historic prognostics of what might have been, and to
recognize that Alexander, provided he kept his mental powers undulled
by drink, would have remained a Greek and not become a Hun or a Vandal.His enthusiasm for absolutism was, when one considers his age and
how deeply he was involved in military plans and schemes, less of a
reflection on himself than a curse to his followers and successors,
who kept faithful to the personal tradition of their leader and made
the Hellenization of Asia untrue to so much that was best in Greek
political life and thought. It was, as Ranke says, a break in their
whole national history, for the Greeks to have extended over them the
kind of authority which was in no way different from that against which
they had contended in warfare for a century. But it must be remembered
that Alexander had only just begun to rule over Asiatics; he had
receded before his death from pressing his theory of amalgamation to
its logical conclusion, and quick as he was to feel instinctively the
meaning of new conditions, it may be fairly supposed that he would have
come to recognize the value of Aristotle’s profoundly wise advice to
him, that he should behave to the Greeks as a leader or president and
to the barbarians or non-Greeks as a master.We may put to one side all the ingenious speculations as to what might
have happened if Alexander had reached the ordinary limit of human
life, a line of thought which Livy seems to have originated, when he
tried to foretell for his age what would have happened if Alexander
had taken up the rôle followed later by his relative, Pyrrhus. It is
only necessary to say that, so far as Greek affairs were concerned,
Alexander was the son of his father. His public career began when, as
Philip’s son, he put the finishing touches to Philip’s program for
dominating the free states of Greece. So long as Alexander lived, the
lines of Macedonian supremacy, the outcome of the battle of Chæronea,
remained clear and fixed. The destruction of Thebes was but the
epilogue of Philip’s own career. The sentimental vein in the nature of
Alexander made him patient with the somewhat childish and ineffective
hostility shown him by both Athens and Sparta, venerable names as
protagonists in the secular struggle with the Persians, whose mantle
had now fallen on his broader shoulders.In Asia his conquests, rather than his half-thought-out plans for
racial amalgamation, were decisive of future political development.
There was an expansion of Hellenic culture throughout the East, marked
by the common use of the Greek language and by a general absorption
of the special traits of Greek social usages and sympathies. The
civilization, so wrought out and transplanted, lost the creativeness
and the spontaneity of the small communities of continental Greece.
The Hellenic spirit lost its potency, if we may so phrase it, and in
the sphere of government especially exhibited disheartening symptoms
of selfishness and greed. Economically, the opening up of Asia meant
enlarged facilities for the commercial exploitation of a vast and
rich territory. It ushered in a period of great industrial fortunes,
it increased opportunities for communication both by land and sea, it
established higher standards of comfort and taste among populations
who had lived a crude, colorless, and isolated existence. On the basis
of Alexander’s conquests a grandiose cosmopolitanism was built up in
Asia which cast down tribal and racial boundaries and made it possible
for masses of plain people to gain a livelihood under tolerable
conditions.  *  *  *  *  *CÆSAR
I CÆSAR’S BEGINNINGS
The progress of an imperial power is obscure even when the foundations
of its greatness are associated with some great military leader or
lawgiver, but when one has to give a reason why some one political
community becomes the point of centripetal attraction, and gathers
about it, either by fear or devotion, the support of large masses of
mankind, the efforts of historical analysis are frustrated at almost
every point.[Illustration: CÆSAR(Naples, Museum.)]');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'The rise of the small town community on the Tiber, about whose name
there centered for nearly two thousand years the dread and the
reverence of the progressive nations of the world, is veiled in legend.
Why did not Palestrina, or Cori, or one of the numerous Etruscan
cities to the north, become the germ of a world-wide rule? Of course
the answer of the economist is that just because Rome is situated on
the Tiber, its position gave it possibilities of advancement denied
to the ordinary hill towns of Italy. This explanation may be taken
as sufficient only when one allows that the burghers of Rome set out
to accomplish what they did, not only because they were traders, but
because the imaginative and grandiose factors in commercial enterprise
must have worked in a singularly sensitive and highly organized social
medium.If the rise of the republic of Rome is difficult to account for, even
more difficult is it to explain why such a community endowed with great
generals, great statesmen, and great patriots, found it impossible so
to modify their republican institutions that the manifest advantages of
a sane and well-balanced democracy might be retained unimpaired, and
might be extended at the same time to conquered races and nations. The
rigidity of Roman republican institutions led to grave and demoralizing
social disorders. The victories of Roman arms abroad were accompanied
by political degradation at home. It must have been felt as a shock
when a local government, admirably devised to promote civic virtues and
secure just administration, was found, just as soon as Rome got the
better of her numerous enemies, to be such a convenient protection for
misrule.As early as the last twenty-five years of the second century before
Christ, the machinery of Roman government seems to have been recognized
as inadequate to perform its functions. Constitutional methods and
precedents were inadequate to solve the agrarian question, nor was
there in the state, as an organism, sufficient force either to check an
oligarchy of wealth or to impose restrictions on the personal ambitions
of successful military leaders such as Marius and Sulla. Some of the
fundamental principles of the Roman republican system were now treated
as legal fiction. There had been years of civil war, for not only had
Rome been attacked by groups of Italian towns associated with her
for several hundred years, but Roman citizens had been divided among
themselves in a way that would have been unthinkable in the period of
the Punic wars.One would like to know the personal political convictions of the
opposing leaders, Marius and Sulla. The probability is that neither of
them looked much farther ahead than does a representative of “boss”
rule in America, who would be very much surprised if asked whether he
would like to see the principles of the political ring incorporated
frankly and definitely in the Constitution of the United States. It is
certain that after the death of Sulla, though personal rule had come
to an end, there was no effort made to prevent its re-emergence. The
question was rather--from what quarter it would emerge. The common
opinion was that the popular general, Pompeius, distinguished by his
victories in the East, would come to take the place left vacant by
Sulla’s death. He had none of the antipathetic personal qualities of
the late dictator, therefore he was regarded as a man of principle,
and accordingly, fitted to supply the personal element in Roman
administration which most people seem to have felt was needed.But all these calculations were soon upset. Pompeius, rapidly elevated
to greatness along a smooth road of easy gradients, trusted to his
friends in Rome to overcome all the political obstacles in his way
there. While he was still acclaimed the great military champion of the
Roman Republic, he soon found himself face to face with a rival--a man
who set himself forward purposefully to revive the popular platform of
the Marian party.Caius Julius Cæsar, born July 12, 100 B.C., had no natural affiliations
with the popular side of politics represented by Marius. So far as
descent was concerned, he was an aristocrat of the aristocrats,
belonging to an ancient patrician _gens_ which traced back its
legendary origin to a divine being--the goddess Venus. Of the early
years of Cæsar only a little is known; and that little is handed down
in the form of anecdotes the value of which lies in the incidental
light they throw on his travels in the eastern part of the Roman world.
It would be more interesting to know something of Cæsar’s education
than of his capture by pirates off the coast of Asia Minor--an accident
used by his ancient biographers to prove what everybody knows--that
he was a brave man even in the most hazardous circumstances. His
early years could not have been spent carelessly, for he acquired a
remarkably sound education. His literary tastes must have been the
result of long discipline. His manysidedness and intellectual facility
were fully recognized by his contemporaries. Even Cicero, who claimed
to have spent his youth as a model “grind,” tacitly allows that Cæsar’s
intellectual equipment was fully the equal of his own. The years of
study were a necessity as well as a diversion. It was not safe even for
a brilliant young man, while the truculent Sulla was dictator, to show
practical interest in home politics, especially if his sympathies were
with the Marian party.And Cæsar was from the first a partisan of Marius. He was pledged
to this political faction by family ties as well as by personal
conviction. Marius’s wife was Cæsar’s aunt, and Cæsar himself had made
the alliance with the Marians closer by taking as his wife the daughter
of Cinna, one of the most active of Marius’s supporters. During the
Reign of Terror caused by the proscriptions of Sulla, Cæsar, because of
his relations with the democratic party, had with difficulty escaped
the dictator’s vengeance, and while Sulla continued to control the
Republic Cæsar found it prudent to withdraw into obscurity, from which
he only emerged when the revival of the democratic tradition could be
safely undertaken. Then he took the first opportunity that offered
itself to make a declaration of loyalty to Marius, the old leader of
the democracy. It was at the death of his aunt, Marius’s widow, that he
delivered a funeral address in which he praised Marius’s principles and
achievements. (68 B.C.) This challenge made to the dominant party by
the young politician was a bold stroke. His speech was the sensation of
the hour, and the glowing words which expressed his purpose of working
for the restoration of the Marian democracy won for him the warm
approval of the popular party. Not long after this Cæsar was chosen
to his first elective office, that of Ædile, in 65 B.C., a somewhat
irregular proceeding, for he was two years short of the legal age.
He used his term of service in order to increase his favor with the
democracy, and he showed a keen political scent in discovering ways
and means by which he could keep himself constantly in the foreground
as the champion of popular rights, earning a reputation for lavish
expenditure of money by giving public games, fairs, and gladiatorial
shows. It was not difficult at this time to win the favor of the
Roman democracy. Pompeius, who controlled the army and through his
position as commander-in-chief exerted a preponderating influence on
the government, was on the point of completing the destruction of the
upstart empire of Mithridates and bringing the Asiatic provinces with
firm hand again under the sway of Rome. There stood in Cæsar’s way as
a competitor for political honors only the second-rate personality of
Crassus, the richest man in Rome, who, somehow, despite his belief in
the venality of the populace and his readiness to act upon his belief,
seemed never to have struck the popular imagination powerfully enough
to acquire the momentum of the genuine demagogue.Cæsar had great advantages through his family connections; his position
as the legitimate heir of Marius made him already a central figure in
the political life of the city, and even Crassus found it advisable
to work for him and with him, by advancing him large sums of money to
cover the lavish expenditure of the three years’ ædileship. Cæsar was
already looking beyond Rome and its purely local interests. That he
had no confidence in the kind of government under which he served is
shown by pretty clear intimations that he was aware of the existence
of a plot, intended to reduce the power of the senatorial oligarchy to
zero. It is certain, too, that Cæsar worked hard to secure a military
command in Egypt, which was not yet a Roman province and, therefore,
could furnish him an admirable vantage ground by its wealth and by
its strategical position for blocking the plans of Pompeius, who was
working through control of the senatorial oligarchy for a revival in
his own hands of personal rule after the Sullan model. This design
of Cæsar was a bold one and conceived with a large vision. Its aim
was to provide a stronghold for the democracy should the central
government, as seemed likely to happen, be manipulated by an irregular
dictatorship. The plan may have been suggested by the career of
Sertorius in Spain, where this successful opponent of the Sullan
régime had so long offered a refuge to all those who were enemies of
the oligarchy that ruled the capital. It was characteristic of Cæsar’s
confident temperament that he was willing, without previous military
training, to undertake a hazardous adventure that meant certainly a
conflict with the seasoned generals of the oligarchy.A further indication, if any were needed, of the purpose of the new
leader of the democratic party to treat Pompeius as the danger point
on the horizon, was a proposed scheme of an agrarian legislation by
which a board was to be created with extensive military and judicial
power for the purpose of selling all the properties and territories
acquired by the state since the year 88, along with all of the war
booty and confiscated revenues now in the hands of Pompeius. To this
measure was added a clause intended to transform the bill into a
popular manifesto for the colonization of Italy with small landholders,
and therefore constructed on the lines of those earlier agrarian laws
which mark the commencement of the struggle of the Roman democracy with
the capitalistic oligarchy two generations before Cæsar’s time. This
agrarian legislation was defeated by Cicero, who in this case, as often
elsewhere, championed the interests of the moneyed classes. He who was
now Consul and was posing as the Grand Conciliator, praised Pompeius
as the strict constitutional champion, and characterized Cæsar’s
agrarian legislation as revolutionary. In the face of the Consul’s
opposition Cæsar hesitated to press the matter and withdrew his bill.
(64 B.C.) As this is the first legislative act brought forward under
Cæsar’s influence, it is interesting to note that his later political
methods and policies are anticipated in it. His Agrarian Law, when
analyzed, contains two elements. There is the purely personal feature,
more or less cleverly concealed in various clauses of the measure
so constructed as to forward the political interests of its author,
and, secondly, one can detect in Cæsar’s plan for agrarian reform a
keen-sighted appreciation of existing social and economic needs. This
last showed itself in the provision that the surplus population of Rome
should be employed as cultivators of the soil. Cicero’s methods of
defeating the bill by appealing to party prejudice were as essentially
demagogic as were Cæsar’s plans for winning popular support for his
measure. The only difference between them was that Cicero was working
in the interest of a capitalistic oligarchy, while Cæsar directly
aimed at the establishment of personal rule under the protection of an
irresponsible commission with unlimited powers. The campaign against
the dominant party was not, however, allowed to drop because of the
withdrawal of the Agrarian Bill. Cæsar, through one of his lieutenants,
brought impeachment proceedings against the murderer of a democratic
leader who had distinguished himself in the last days of Marius. It was
part of his pin-pricking policy, meant to intimidate the senatorial
faction, and the aim was clear, for the Senate had by a decree relieved
the murderer of responsibility years before. Nothing came of the
impeachment, but it went on record as showing Cæsar’s loyalty to the
democracy. His next proposal was especially gratifying to the admirers
of Marius, because it involved the removal from the children of the
victims of the Sullan proscription the disqualification by which they
were prevented from holding public office.Soon after this, in the spring of 63, when there was a vacancy in
the office of Pontifex Maximus, the supreme head of the religion of
the city of Rome, Cæsar became a candidate. There were no religious
qualifications necessary; the office had no more relation to personal
belief than that of a prince bishop of the later history of the German
States, when territorial princes added the episcopal to their other
titles. Cæsar was one of the most advanced free-thinkers in Rome. But
he felt no incongruity, and apparently no one else did, in his desire
to figure as the director of the traditional religious usages of the
capital. The position meant so much to Cæsar that, heavily indebted as
he was, he refused to withdraw his name, when a large sum was offered
by an opposing candidate on condition that he would retire from the
contest. The office of Pontifex Maximus carried with it a number of
powers with great political possibilities, because in addition to
controlling the property attached to the college of priests over which
he presided, the Pontifex had important jurisdiction in religious
questions, the determination of religious scruples, and the charge of
the Calendar. All of these matters were intimately connected with the
Roman legislative procedure and also with the judicial system as worked
by the Roman magistrates. Moreover, it was a life position, and one’s
only surprise is that Cæsar’s administration of the office was not
attacked by his enemies. As a matter of fact, his career as an official
religious leader is marked by beneficent reforms in the Calendar and
by a solid contribution to the science of chronology.There was some difficulty in the election, for it had been placed by
Sulla in the hands of the members of the college. But this measure was
repealed, and when the people became the electors, Cæsar had easily the
majority of the votes over his two conservative opponents. The year 63
had not been, as we have seen, a happy or tranquil one for the men in
power; there had been a constant series of attacks made upon them, and
they had been forced to stand steadily on the defensive.Before the time for the consular elections the extreme wing of the
popular party appeared to have got out of hand. They selected for
their candidate Catiline, a leading spirit among the criminal and
corrupt order of Roman society, who had contested the election before
and had been defeated. Cæsar had already energetically supported
Catiline, but in the latter’s second attempt to be elected Consul,
it seems clear that Cæsar’s support was at best half-hearted. Cæsar
had come to know the reckless nature of Catiline’s program, with its
appeal for a general canceling of debts and its general attack on all
capitalistic interests. The scheme, however, did win the approval of
the discontented classes, and the occasion for carrying it through
was favorable, because Pompeius, the only man with a military force
adequate to act forcibly on behalf of the senatorial oligarchy, was
absent still in the East. It was understood that Catiline, if he
obtained office, would use it to inaugurate a social revolution;
if he were defeated, it was planned that violent methods should be
used to force a change of government on the oligarchy. An army was
to be collected in Italy, the city was to be set on fire, and in the
confusion the reins of government would be taken by Catiline and his
followers.The plot was shrewdly defeated by Cicero, who was given by the
Senate unlimited powers, after a state of siege had been proclaimed.
Catiline escaped from the city, taking refuge with his army, which had
been collected near Florence; but several of the other conspirators
were taken prisoners in Rome, and the question of their fate was
brought up before the Senate. Cæsar had by report been implicated in
the conspiracy, but Cicero refused to follow up these suspicions.
Accordingly, in the senatorial debate, Cæsar appeared rather in the
light of a cross bench statesman than as a firm supporter of the
revolutionary leader.It must be remembered that the Senate had no right to condemn a man
to death or to banishment. A general in the field could inflict the
death sentence without appeal, but no magistrate within the precincts
of the city could do so; there was an appeal from his decision to the
people legally assembled. Cicero wished to get from the Senate an
authoritative opinion, as to whether under their previous decree of
martial law he could exercise in the city the summary rights allowed to
a general in the field. Cæsar spoke after the consular members of the
Senate, all of whom had declared for the administration of the extreme
penalty. He opposed it in a careful and statesmanlike speech, using
his opportunity for putting himself on record as the upholder of the
democratic view of the constitution.As no verbal report of any other of Cæsar’s speeches has come down to
us, it is interesting to give an extract from Sallust’s version, which
may be taken as an accurate outline, for, owing to Cicero’s personal
interest in the matter, the whole proceedings of the Senate during this
crucial debate were taken down in shorthand. After deprecating the use
of rhetoric as likely to prejudice the judgment, and remarking that
eloquent pictures of the horrors of war and rebellion were alien to
the matter in hand, Cæsar’s words were: “And indeed, for the crimes we
have to deal with, no penalty is in itself too cruel; death at least
cannot be so, for it puts an end to the misery of this life and brings
no torment in another. But the penalty will be looked on as cruel,
simply because it is unconstitutional. It has been over and over again
forbidden by express legislation to scourge or kill a citizen without
trial. You do not propose to scourge these men, presumably because the
law forbids it. Why, then, do you propose to put them to death? Both
penalties are equally illegal. I must remind you also of the precedent
your action will create. Once place such a power as you claim in the
hands of a government and you cannot put a limit on its use; it may be
and will be used against good and bad alike, as it was by the Thirty
at Athens and in our own recollection by Sulla. I do not fear this
now or with Cicero as Consul; but I will not answer for the power of
the sword in the hands of future Consuls. Let us abide by the law and
not seek in a panic to overrule it. My advice is, not indeed that we
let these men go, and thus increase the resources of Catiline, but
that we commit them for life to close custody in the largest Italian
towns, securing them by holding over each town the heaviest possible
penalty in case they should escape. And I further propose that we pass
a decree embodying our opinion that no proposal touching them shall be
made henceforth either in Senate or assembly; and that disregard of
the decree shall be treated by the Senate as high treason against the
state.”The hint of a reaction was not an oratorical commonplace; it was
suggested by the recent history of Rome itself, and proved most
effective, for even Cicero’s own brother, Quintus, who followed Cæsar,
expressed his agreement with him. Cicero himself, in his reply, took
a rather wavering position, paying special attention to the practical
proposals of Cæsar, which so many modern historians have decided to
be weak and specious. But these have forgotten that, even if Cæsar’s
plans for keeping the prisoners as perpetual ticket-of-leave men in
various Italian communities offered no effective guarantee that they
would not escape, there was no especial reason for fearing their
presence again in Rome after Catiline and his army had been destroyed.
None of the conspirators was a man of first-rate ability, and besides,
the experience of unsuccessful conspiracy has almost as strong an
educational effect as imprisonment. Many Paris communards settled down
as peaceful citizens.Cicero made an unfortunate experiment at this juncture. The Senate
listened readily to the summary appeals for justice to traitors
made by Cato, but Cicero’s execution of the Catilinarians was stored
up against him in the popular mind, and much of the good he might
have done in his political career was frustrated by his weakness in
identifying himself with the blind passion of the reactionary party.
For the moment, however, Cicero carried the people with him; they lost
their heads, alarmed by the wild tales of conflagration and massacre.
Cæsar’s life was in danger, because he had pleaded for a policy of
moderation, and it must be allowed that the words of his speech did not
represent a pose. The principles he stood for in 63 he adhered to after
the civil wars were over, when a word from him might have initiated a
proscription after the Sullan model.
II ALLIANCE WITH POMPEIUS AND CRASSUS
The year following the suppression of the Catiline conspiracy was one
of uncertainty. Pompeius was returning home after his six years’ stay
in the East. The question was whether he would play the rôle of a new
Sulla. It seems generally to have been expected that he would. There
was no army in Italy strong enough to resist his will; certainly the
force which had overcome Catiline near Fiesole was quite unequal to
such a work. The question was, who were to be his friends and what
policy would he pursue. One of the general’s emissaries appeared in
Rome, and made it clear that Pompeius could not be used as a mere tool
of the senatorial party. Cicero made tactless overtures to secure his
favor, and met with a cold reception.Cæsar showed more diplomacy, paying the general the compliment of
requesting him to finish the Capitoline temple, one of the chief
shrines of the civic religion of Rome. This duty came within Cæsar’s
province as Pontifex Maximus, and besides as Prætor for this year
he held a position which made his influence useful to the returning
general. Both the scheme for the restoration of the temple and a
measure for recalling Pompeius to the city, which was supported by
Cæsar, were opposed by the Senate, and the discussion led to such
violence that the Senate suspended Cæsar from his functions as
magistrate, and only restored him when he had personally intervened to
quiet the passions of the mob.Though Cæsar’s year of office was over (61 B.C.), and the time had
come for him to administer Spain as Proprætor, that being the province
assigned him, he delayed his departure. There were many grounds for
this course. Pompeius had been keeping his own counsel as to his
future plans, and required watching. Cæsar had difficulties with his
creditors; he had long been heavily in debt, and his year of office,
with its sensational political activities, must have severely drained
his resources.But the chief cause which delayed his journey west was the violation,
in the House of the Pontifex Maximus, of the sacred mysteries of the
Bona Dea by a young Quæstor-elect, Clodius, who was suspected of being
the lover of Cæsar’s wife, Pompeia. A scandal involving the head of the
state religion was a serious matter, and Cæsar lived up to the rôle
assigned him by sententiously remarking that Cæsar’s wife ought not
even to be suspected and by seizing this opportunity of divorcing her.
The step satisfied public opinion at the time, but the dignity of the
act is somewhat lessened in the eyes of later critics from the fact
that the Pontifex Maximus himself was, even according to the flexible
standards of Rome, notorious for his moral laxity.When Clodius’ trial was held, Cæsar diplomatically denied that he had
any certain knowledge of the case. Politics were so much involved in
this trial that proscriptions might have been initiated. Clodius was
a figure in the popular party, and, in the end, by the common method
of bribing the judges, an acquittal was secured. Pompeius, in the
midst of this exciting time, had arrived in Rome, thus giving Cæsar
an opportunity of taking the measure of the over-praised Eastern
conqueror. Before Cæsar left for Spain, mutual advances had taken
place, and he felt sure that Pompeius would not ally himself with the
senatorial party. Cæsar also continued to be on good terms with the
millionaire Crassus, and before leaving Italy he borrowed from him
eighteen hundred talents to satisfy the demands of creditors.Of the period of Cæsar’s rule in Spain little is known; but his service
there was valuable to him because, while contending with the hardy hill
tribes, who were constantly in arms against the Romans, he received
a training in war that afterwards stood him in good stead. He showed
himself, too, an able and conscientious administrator, regardful of
the condition of the provincials, who had suffered from the loss of
property and from heavy taxation during the unintermitted war that took
place while the government at Rome was destroying the home-rule system
set up by Sertorius. The beneficent character of Cæsar’s administration
showed itself in his friendly relation with the free city of Gades,
where he was called in to reform the local laws and to settle factional
disputes. The prosperity of the town in after years may reasonably
be supposed to have dated from this period. Even Cicero speaks in
glowing language of Cæsar’s supervision. The generous character of his
treatment of the town is seen in its admission twelve years afterwards
to the full Roman franchise. One of the most distinguished of the
citizens of Gades, Balbus, became Cæsar’s confidential agent and
secretary, serving in this capacity for many years without a break.
After his master’s death, Balbus rose to be Prætor and Consul; he was
the first enfranchised foreigner who held these highest offices in Rome.All the affairs relating to his provincial government were set in order
in the spring of 59 B.C., when Cæsar set out for Rome to be there in
time for the consular elections, which were usually held in summer. He
had two objects in view: one to secure the dignity of a triumph, the
official stamp of a successful military commander; the other to present
himself as a candidate for the consulship. It was impossible for him
while holding a military command to appear within the walls and
formally solicit the votes of his fellow-citizens. He therefore asked
for permission to become a candidate without fulfilling the formal
conditions, and this request the Senate refused to grant. Cæsar solved
the difficulty by sacrificing the triumph; he resigned his command and
entered the city as a private individual.But now the opposition to him took another form. A determined
aristocrat, M. Calpurnius Bibulus, who, apart from his political
tenets, had a long-standing personal grudge against Cæsar, was put up
by the senatorial party as his colleague for the consulship, and was
elected by the lavish use of money. Cæsar’s next move in this game of
political strategy was a master stroke of astuteness; he formed a close
combination with Pompeius, whom the senatorial party had just irritated
by vetoing all his pet schemes, among them an opportunity of a second
consulship and a plan to reward his soldiers by a distribution of
public lands. As a third member of the alliance Crassus was introduced,
a valuable asset because of the great financial backing he could give.
He saw a chance for promoting his political advancement with two such
colleagues to help him. It was a frank system of give and take; there
were no strong personal ties between any of the three members of the
junta, but they had at least a common opponent, the senatorial party.An effort was made, though it was unsuccessful, to detach Cicero from
his friendly relations with the aristocratic majority in the Senate;
as he declined the invitation, the new political machine became a
triumvirate, the union of three influential persons to overcome
opposition and to prevent the wheels of public business from being
blocked by the endless methods of obstruction ever ready to be employed
in the complicated system of Roman government, where the checks were
more numerous than the balances. It simply meant that these three men,
and not the reactionary senators, should decide on the distribution of
provinces, on the candidates for offices, and on the command of armies.
From the record of all three, it was clear that the technique of the
constitutional system would not be treated with great reverence, for
all were practical politicians and had definite personal ambitions to
gratify.As Consul, Cæsar began his year of magistracy with a policy of studied
moderation. He tried to get on with Bibulus by showing him marked
consideration in the way of official precedence, and his first reform
of senatorial practice concerned a subject which might well have been
taken as a non-controversial matter, the publication of the Senate’s
proceedings. Cæsar proposed that a summary of each debate should be
exposed to view in the Forum. It was an intimation to the senators that
they must hold themselves responsible to public opinion.The next proposal was to make some arrangement by which the veterans of
Pompeius’ army should be supplied with public lands. These lands had
to be acquired by the state from private owners, so the proceeds of
the extensive conquests of Pompeius’ conquests in the East were to be
applied to this purpose. The Senate refused to listen to any agrarian
measure; the very name frightened them. Cato obstructed, trying to talk
the scheme out in the Senate. Cæsar, who had as little respect for
parliamentary procedure as Cromwell, put a stop to this copious oratory
by placing the speaker under arrest. He was soon released, however, in
deference to the pressure of his colleagues.In the face of the hopeless opposition of the Senate to the Consul’s
legislation, the only course left to pursue was for Cæsar to present
his legislation directly to the popular assembly, without the
authorization of the Senate. This method was extraordinary, but not
absolutely illegal, and it had been employed by reformers since the
time of Tiberius Gracchus. There were, of course, grave objections to
it, for measures could be rushed through without proper discussion, and
it is well known that hasty legislation is often dangerous, even for
those who promote it. A specially drastic feature of the agrarian bill
was the clause which compelled senators and all officers, to be elected
in future, to swear to be faithful to its provisions.In this way Cæsar hoped to secure his measure from being abrogated
when the year of his magistracy was over. This clause was not,
however, a new expedient, but it was now being used in a new way to
prevent the claim that prerogatives of the Senate had been violated by
passing legislation without consulting its wishes. Pompeius promised
to support the bill by arms if violence were resorted to on the other
side. A Tribune exercised his right to veto on the measure, when it was
introduced in the popular assembly, but this old constitutional check
was contemptuously disregarded. Also, when Bibulus, the conservative
colleague of Cæsar, interfered by formally delaying action in the
measure, he was forcibly removed from the Forum by some of Pompeius’
veterans. Bibulus was equally powerless when he invoked religious
scruples of a technical kind, for Cæsar was Pontifex Maximus as well
as Consul. Bibulus’ interpretations of signs and omens were ruled out
as irregular. Even when the bill was passed by the people, he kept up
opposition in the Senate and tried to induce the senators to declare
the agrarian law null and void. They, however, were not prepared to
join him in such a hazardous undertaking, so in disgust he withdrew for
the rest of his term into private life. His retirement led the people
to remark jokingly that the two Consuls for the year were Julius and
Cæsar, not Cæsar and Bibulus.The passage of the agrarian democratic measure, as it stood, was
undertaken to fulfil engagements made with Pompeius, whose troops were
especially concerned in this distribution of lands. Equally personal
were the measures passed by the people to regularize the situation of
the territories in the East, where Pompeius, after his conquests, had
acted on his own initiative in making treaties, imposing taxation, and
settling the terms of local administration. The personal relations
between the two triumvirs were now drawn closer by the marriage of
Cæsar’s daughter Julia to Pompeius; she was at this time twenty-two
years old, and as long as she lived she prevented any open rupture
between her husband and her father.In another legislative enactment Cæsar attested his loyal
interpretation of the triumvirate compact rather than his desire to
forward the public interests of the state. Crassus desired that the
farmers of the taxes in the province of Asia should be relieved from
the contract which they had made with the government. It was a shady
piece of business; even Cicero, who was not apt to be critical where
capitalistic interests were involved, called the scheme of Crassus
shameful. It was defeated in the Senate by the determined efforts of
Cato. The measure was afterwards jammed through the popular assembly in
a form which relieved the taxgatherers of one-third of their financial
burden.This was really a shrewd move to separate from the senatorial party
the whole mercantile class, who normally acted solidly with them. They
now looked upon the triumvirate combination as favorable to their
interests, and so deprived the Senate of a solid support at a time
when that body needed every element of the population in its unequal
struggle with the triumvirs.Much more worthy than this act of special legislation was a measure
for dealing with extortion on the part of provincial administrators.
The Roman governors and their subordinates treated the provinces
as legitimate spoil, by which they could balance the large amounts
spent at home in political corruption. This system offered the most
unwholesome example of ring rule. Every man in public life had a good
chance of ruling a province at some time in his career, and there was
no inducement to touch a well-tried system which had proved profitable
to all concerned.Cæsar’s law was a blanket measure, evidently drawn with great
intelligence and showing the familiarity of an ex-provincial official
with the concrete needs of the situation. It extended the jurisdiction
of existing courts for cases of provincial extortion, in regard to
the definition of the crime, the persons liable, and the penalties
to be imposed. All the methods of extortion were brought within the
scope of this act. The governor and his official staff were held
liable, and the punishment, hitherto chiefly imposed by damages, was
increased to deprivation of the right to bequeath property, and in some
cases expulsion from the Senate and exile were inflicted on offending
officials.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'Good as this legislation was, it contained a political element which
prevented it from meeting the whole situation of provincial misrule.
The triumvirate, we have seen, made a distinct bid for the favor of
the mercantile classes when the previous bill was passed relieving
the taxgatherers of Asia from the full extent of their contract. This
new law only concerned the administration of senatorial officials;
it did not put an end to extortion, nor did it stop the avenues of
public corruption, because the financiers, the men who gathered about
the official ruling class, were left to ply their nefarious trade
unmolested.But Cæsar’s consulship broke the power of the senatorial aristocracy,
which had been on the decline ever since the death of Sulla. By his
alliance with Pompeius and Crassus a continuity of policy was secured,
under which the old republican principle that cessation of office
meant also cessation of power came to an end. The main business at the
close of his year of service as Consul was to arrange that the system
he had started should continue to work smoothly. The two candidates
for the consulship were pledged supporters of the triumvirate. An even
more important tool was the active and unscrupulous Clodius, who had
made himself notorious because of the Bona Dea scandal. He was made a
Tribune, and as such became the local agent in Rome of the triumvirs’
interests. He signalized his entrance into office by abolishing the
small payment still exacted on the state distribution of grain to the
people, and he organized the masses into guilds, each under a district
leader, so that the populace could be controlled and could be worked
together either as a political machine or as a mob, whether to vote or
to do deeds of violence according to the password of their leader.The Senate, in arranging the assignment of provinces in B.C. 59, had
tried to diminish Cæsar’s influence by giving him for his work as
Proconsul the duty of attending to the internal condition of Italy.
This meant that he would have no military force at his command, and
that he would be expected to devote himself to the supervision of roads
and public works. The senatorial arrangement for rendering their chief
opponent innocuous was simply an invitation to him to treat it as
non-existing. It was proposed to set the Senate’s action aside and to
give Cisalpine Gaul and the adjoining province of Illyria to Cæsar for
a period of five years.When the new measure was before the popular assembly, the Senate, under
pressure from Pompeius, voted that in addition to Cisalpine Gaul in the
Celtic region on the Italian side of the Alps, the Gallic province,
with an ample army and suitable staff, should be assigned to Cæsar. It
was known that there was restlessness among the Gauls and the Germans,
who were on the borders of the prosperous Roman province in southern
Gaul along the lower Rhone. This was, of course, an opportunity for
real proconsular duty, but probably no one who voted for the assignment
realized the possibilities of the command which now fell into Cæsar’s
hand.But before setting out for his province (58 B.C.), Cæsar remained near
at hand to supervise Clodius’ arrangements for muzzling the Senate; it
was not safe for the new Proconsul to absent himself from Rome until
affairs there had been brought so under control that there would be no
chance of a senatorial reactionary movement. Clodius first abolished
the use of indefinitely prolonged obstruction, a practice involved in
the religious privilege of “watching the heavens” for evil omens, and a
method of delay normally used to prevent the assemblies of the people
from being held. The next step was to hinder the Censors from making a
combination to remove from the Senate partisans of Cæsar. This purpose
was secured by another law of Clodius that made it impossible for
the Censor to strike from the roll of the Senate anyone, except on a
formal accusation, and no member could be removed even then unless both
Censors acted together.Cæsar attempted also to conciliate Cicero by offering him a staff
appointment; on this being refused, as it was desirable to deprive
the senatorial party of the oratorical talents which gave Cicero a
hold on the people, Clodius was allowed to bring charges against him
in connection with the execution of the Catilinarian conspirators.
The terms of the new law were perfectly general; it simply outlawed
any person who had or should hereafter put to death a Roman citizen
uncondemned, that is, without due trial and sentence. Cicero took
the hint and fled from Rome. At the same time the uncompromising
senatorial obstructionist Cato was “kicked upstairs” by being given an
appointment as commissioner to supervise the annexation of the island
of Cyprus. Ample time was allowed him, and it was arranged that when
he had finished with Cyprus, he should go to Byzantium and settle some
unimportant disputes in that free city. With Cato kept busy at a long
distance from Rome, and with Cicero out of the way, there was little to
fear with Clodius acting in the rôle of “boss” of Rome.
III THE CONQUEST OF GAUL
Very soon after the flight of the great orator, Cæsar, who had been
watching with his army the proceedings within the city, started for his
province of Gaul. The country which was to be the scene of his labors
as governor, and in which through successive campaigns his reputation
in generalship was to be made, was larger than modern France, for it
extended to the Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenees. Only a part of
it was familiar to the Romans, and for this reason one of the most
striking proofs of Cæsar’s skill as a commander is the ability and
certainty with which he penetrated into regions unvisited before and
therefore unfamiliar to him except by the hearsay stories of the casual
traveler. The province had originally been occupied by the Romans in
the struggle with Hannibal, because it secured their land communication
with Spain. In its southern part it was well developed and civilized,
but the limit of Roman rule northward was marked by the valley of the
Rhone, and the famous city of Lyons had not yet been founded, which was
later on the headquarters of Roman power in Gaul.Much trouble was being experienced from Germanic invaders farther
north, who were crossing the Rhine and were in great numbers occupying
the fertile lands to the east of them. The Gauls themselves had no
cohesive power of resistance; they were constantly quarreling among
themselves, and it seemed only a question of time when the Germans,
uniting with the Gauls, who were certain to become subject to their
rule, would overwhelm the peaceful and civilized inhabitants of the
Roman province. The situation required immediate attention, for the
Ædui who lived between the Loire and the Saône were calling on the
Romans as allies for help and protection against their neighbors,
other Gaulish tribes, who with the aid of the German king, Ariovistus,
were threatening to take their land. Besides, it was reported that the
Helvetic and the German peoples were contemplating a migration on a
large scale, induced to leave south Germany by the prospect of finding
better lands farther west.The country as a whole was in a state of unrest; the unconquered mass
of the free tribes, extending from the fringe of Roman occupation
in the south to the North Sea, might easily become dangerous to the
countries under Roman occupation on the other side of the Pyrenees and
the Alps. Up to the time of Cæsar’s advent, the government at Rome had
shown singular apathy; a few resolutions had been passed, directing
that the allied tribes should be aided, but no additions were made to
the army in the province. The emotional temperament of the Gauls made
them subject to quick changes in their point of view; unless something
were done quickly, even the allies of Rome would have to be counted on
the other side. It was easy for them to drop their present allegiance,
for they were as a mass a servile population, guided by an aristocracy
of nobles or knights, and by a widely extended and mysterious guild,
the Druids, who each year held a solemn assembly in a sacred place in
the center of the land.The general difficulties of coping with the situation were great when
Cæsar took command, but the special details of the position as it
confronted him increased the obstacles in the way of prompt action.
There was but one legion beyond the Alps; the other three were far
away in Aquileia at the top of the Adriatic. It was fortunate for him
that he could draw on the reserves of Cisalpine Gaul, the richest part
of Italy, the province which extended over the plains of Lombardy
to Tuscany. This province was filled with a hardy race of yeomen
cultivators, a mixed population, having its origin in the conquered
Celtic tribes and in genuine Roman colonists.Nowhere else could there be found a better recruiting ground for the
legions, and nowhere also, on account of the general intelligence of
the inhabitants, would the personal qualities of a general find a more
immediate response. The tactfulness of Cæsar had already been put to
the test in the arena of political life; he had learned how to make
friends and to hold them. Apart from the technical gifts of military
art, the personal charm of Cæsar’s character was a great factor in
securing for him an army made up of devoted troops and officers.
They trusted him, and they were held to him as a leader, because he
seems from the first to have been able to establish close relations
of a spontaneous and genuine type with those who were under him. His
army was not a mere fighting machine, but an organism reflecting the
individual driving power and coolness of the man who led it.The series of campaigns in Gaul begins with Cæsar’s successful blocking
of the migration of the Helvetii. All that is known of the details
of the strategy employed by the Romans is derived from Cæsar’s own
report, which has been frequently criticised as intentionally obscure
and misleading. It must be remembered that the famous commentaries on
the Gallic wars were hurriedly dictated, and were meant to tell the
public what the commander-in-chief wished them to know and nothing
more. For example, many modern authorities are agreed that the numbers
of the migrating Helvetii are very much overestimated by Cæsar and that
the real purpose of their migration was artfully concealed. Napoleon,
who was a past master in falsifying military records, declared
that the campaign against the Helvetii as narrated by Cæsar was
incomprehensible.The real situation in Gaul prior to the migration seems to have been as
follows. As we have said, Ariovistus, the German king, was in control
of the central part of the country. This overlordship was burdensome
to the Gauls, who paid him a yearly tribute. A prince of the Ædui,
Divitiacus, had turned to the Romans for help, but his request was
rejected, for Ariovistus, during Cæsar’s own consulship, had been
acknowledged as king and formally declared an ally and friend of the
Roman people. There was another party among the Ædui, led by Dumnorix,
the brother of Divitiacus, who favored throwing off the German yoke,
and urged a general uprising of the Gauls, unassisted by the Romans.Not far away from Æduan territory were the Helvetii, who were
independent of the rule of Ariovistus, and with them the autonomous
party among the Ædui entered into friendly relations in order to secure
them as allies against the Germans. The Helvetii were to be persuaded
by their leaders to migrate to western Gaul, and it was arranged that,
when the whole tribe was slowly passing through the land of the Ædui,
there should be a rising against Ariovistus. The Ædui could count on
the assistance of the Helvetii, because as future occupants of Gallic
territory the immigrants would have no desire to be dependents of the
German king.This situation and this program were known to Cæsar before he left
Rome, for he was in communication with the pro-Roman party among the
Ædui. It was of course his object to frustrate this plan of driving out
the Germans without the help of Rome, because it was to his interest
that Roman overlordship should take the place of German control. The
request of the Helvetii to be allowed to pass peacefully through Roman
territory came just in time. It gave Cæsar the opportunity of defending
the frontier and strengthening his army.As soon as the Helvetii were refused a passage through the Roman
province, they started directly for the land of the Ædui, crossing
over the Roman territory, and so they abandoned the fiction of a
migration to the west. In the meantime, by the liberal use of money,
the pro-Roman party among the Ædui had got the upper hand. Accordingly
when the Helvetii, whose rear division had been attacked by Cæsar
as they were crossing the Saône, reached the land of their would-be
allies, they were treated as enemies by the Ædui, who were now calling
on Cæsar for help to resist the invaders. The Helvetii, willing to
return, desired to come to terms with the Roman general, but they
refused to accept the Roman conditions as to hostages. They started
to retrace their steps by following a more northerly course on their
return in order to take advantage of the mountainous country, as a
protection against an attack on the part of the Romans.Cæsar followed warily; his own troops were indeed strengthened by
Æduan cavalry, but these, on the first engagement, had fled before the
enemy. It was obvious their loyalty could not be depended upon, and
significant, too, that Dumnorix was in command. When an attempt to
surround the Helvetii with two Roman legions failed, Cæsar withdrew
to Bibracte, the Æduan capital, to replenish his army and probably
to prevent the defection of his allies. The Helvetii might now have
returned to their old home unmolested, but they were embittered against
the Romans, who had shown constant hostility to their movements,
whether they advanced or retreated, and they were quite willing to
treat with the patriotic party among the Ædui, who asked them now for
help against the Romans. They turned back therefore, with the purpose
of attacking the Romans as they were marching towards Bibracte.The actual number of the Helvetii engaged in this operation cannot
have been very great, for their wagon train was in a very short time
collected, formed, and turned into an improvised citadel. Their
movements before, during, and after battle show that the number 368,000
given by Cæsar is enormously exaggerated. Altogether, including allied
forces, Cæsar’s army may be reckoned at 40,000 men. There were six
legions (36,000 men) and allied cavalry to the number of 4000.When the Helvetii approached, the brunt of the fighting was assigned to
four legions of veterans; the rest, the fresh recruits and the allies,
were placed behind the line of battle and directed to protect the camp.
As the Helvetii attacked the four legions, who were advantageously
stationed on the slope of a hill, they were thrown back; but, as the
legions advanced, these in turn were vigorously attacked on their
flanks. The battle was hotly contested, the Romans taking the offensive
both in the front and on the sides. Slowly the enemy withdrew, and it
was dark before the Roman army took the massed wagons by assault. After
the victory, Cæsar remained on the field of battle for three days. The
Helvetii fled towards the east and a few days later surrendered, most
of them being sent back to their old homes. The Helvetian overthrow was
a useful stroke; it made a decided impression on the Gauls, who were
now able to take the measure of the new commander of the Romans.The next move was to break the power of Ariovistus. Cæsar represents
the suggestion as coming from various Gallic deputations, who besought
him to help them cast off the German yoke. But it is obvious that the
presence of Ariovistus in Gaul was incompatible with the purpose of
Cæsar to subjugate the entire country. All negotiations with the German
chieftain proved futile; he insisted on keeping the Gallic tribes as
his tributaries, and simply asked to be let alone.Cæsar took his army to the east and came into contact with the Germans
in the neighborhood of Belfort or in southern Alsace; it is impossible
to determine the locality with precision. Ariovistus collected his
wagons into a fortified camp on an elevation a short distance from the
position of the Romans, using his advantage to break up by cavalry
sorties the Roman line of communication. His plan appears to have been
to force the Romans to withdraw and to attack them on their march. The
German leader took full advantage of the mobility of his troops, and
his cavalry proved too strong for the Gallic horse on the side of the
Romans. All attempts to draw Ariovistus from his camp failed, until
Cæsar divided his army, placing two legions in a fortified position,
where they could more efficiently protect the line of communications.
This smaller camp Ariovistus tried to take by storm, and failed.When the main Roman army advanced, and began to threaten the wagon
citadel of the Germans, Ariovistus determined to give battle. The
battle itself was won through the superior discipline of the Romans;
once during its progress the left wing was in danger, but it was saved
by the prompt action of the younger Crassus, who was in command of
the cavalry. Cæsar with the right wing carried all before him. As to
the numbers engaged, it was Napoleon’s opinion that the Germans were
not stronger than Cæsar; the probability is that they were weaker.
Ariovistus’ whole army, though with it he controlled a large part of
Gaul, need not have been more than 20,000 men. They were, of course,
a better trained fighting force than anything the Gallic tribes could
create, and it was not difficult, using the divisions among the Gauls,
to establish an effective overlordship with a small, well-disciplined
army.Apparently the bulk of the German army was destroyed; Ariovistus,
however, succeeded in making his escape beyond the Rhine. The defeat
of the Germans had important consequences; before the opening of the
campaign against Ariovistus, news had come from the north that the
Suevi, an important German tribe, were about to move across the Rhine.
The knowledge of the fate of Ariovistus forced them back again into the
depths of Germany.During the winter Cæsar crossed the Alps to attend to the
administration of the Cisalpine province, leaving his troops quartered
in Gaul under the command of his trusted lieutenant, Labienus. He
raised two new legions, and when he returned northward it was already
plain that the pacification of the country was far from complete. The
Gauls feared the expansion of Roman power, and there were rumors of an
uprising to be led by the tribes of the Belgæ. Cæsar marched directly
to the danger spot, and taking advantage of tribal jealousies, induced
the Remi, whose territory lay between the Maas, the Oise, and the
Maine, to accept the alliance and protectorate of Rome. (57 B.C.)This was a wise move, for it was clear from reports on the spot that
the whole Belgic confederacy, representing the most warlike of the
Gallic tribes, were up in arms. The fate of Ariovistus, the year
before, had shown that the only way to resist the extension of Roman
rule in Gaul was by tribal combination. The Belgæ thoroughly realized
their danger, and when Cæsar passed their frontiers, they opposed him
with a large allied army composed of contingents of all the neighboring
peoples.The great difficulty was to keep such large masses of men together
and to provide them with food. In the time of Marius, the Germanic
invaders, the Cimbri and the Teutones, in order to secure provisions as
they went, had divided into several smaller groups, each one of which
was beaten in detail by the Roman general. Cæsar’s strategy was to be
governed by the same principles; he meant to wear the Belgæ out and
to refuse to give battle until they had lost their unity, until each
dissevered fraction might be drawn into action without support from the
rest. Cæsar having recruited two new legions, in all there were eight.
Besides, there served under him a variegated band of allies, Numidians,
Cretans, men of the Balearic Islands, and Gallic cavalry.Altogether the Roman fighting host may be reckoned at fifty to sixty
thousand men, with camp followers, perhaps nearly one hundred thousand
in all. To keep such a body in the field for a considerable time meant
a carefully organized system of transportation and economic equipment.
A strongly fortified camp was constructed on the north bank of the
River Aisne, where the soldiers were kept in good discipline. The
remains of extensive fortifications, in the form of ditches eighteen
feet wide and nine or ten feet deep, and a wall with palisades twelve
feet high, were found on the site of Cæsar’s camp by the archæologists
who worked under the direction of Napoleon III.The camp was in the country of the Remi, who had, as we have
mentioned, become allies of the Romans; it was their town Bibrax
which the Belgæ first attacked, hoping to induce Cæsar to leave his
fortified position to repel them. He remained, however, where he was,
sending sufficient help in the way of defensive artillery to enable the
townsmen to defend themselves and to force the Belgæ to give up the
siege. They then turned to attack the Roman camp. Cæsar drew up his
army, but neither side had any desire to come to close quarters, as in
front of the camp there was a considerable stretch of swampy ground.
The Belgæ then tried to cut off the Roman line of communications, but
this involved crossing the Aisne, and its banks were closely watched by
Cæsar’s men. A few horsemen and war engines were sufficient to deter
them from making the attempt.If the Belgæ had crossed with their whole army, they could have carried
out their purpose; the Roman communications would have been broken, but
the Romans could have gone ahead, and the Belgæ, outside of their own
land, had no way of maintaining their supplies. The only thing to do
was to surround the Roman camp from all sides and starve it out. Even
with their superior numbers, which Cæsar gives as 306,000, this was a
difficult operation, for the enveloping lines, owing to the country
being traversed by two rivers, would have been large. In any case the
Belgæ recognized that they could not keep the field long, and when
they heard that Cæsar’s allies, the Ædui, were invading their country,
they decided to withdraw, the confederated tribes engaging to help one
another if Cæsar’s army invaded their territory. The retreat of the
Belgæ was so unexpected that at first the Romans took it for a feint
meant to provoke them to leave their camp.As soon as the news was well authenticated, the cavalry pursued the
retreating barbarians, keeping up a series of irritating attacks. The
Belgic strongholds surrendered soon after; only three tribes, the
Nervii, the Viromandui, and the Atrebates, tried to strike a blow for
Gallic freedom. They fell upon the Romans, while they were arranging to
encamp in a woody country on the Sambre, and caused almost a panic.
The allied troops fled in confusion, but the legionaries held their
ground, getting themselves in line, and as they were far superior in
numbers to the Nervii, they soon got the upper hand of them, although
there was some sharp fighting and for a time two of the legions were
hard pressed. It was part of the Roman general’s strategy not to face a
superior force. This point is apparent in the previous campaigns, but,
as a military writer, Cæsar had no scruples in manipulating his figures
for popular consumption. When the Nervii made peace unconditionally,
they represented themselves, according to Cæsar, as having only 500 men
left out of an original 60,000 capable of bearing arms; a few years
later they appear again in the Commentaries as having a considerable
army. They also sent a contingent of 5000 to Alesia at the close of
the Gallic war. Probably a just estimate of the fighting force of the
Nervii would give them 30,000 men, because the whole population of the
district could hardly have been more than 150,000 souls. They occupied
a territory of four hundred square kilometers, and with the slight
density of population in Gaul, they could not have numbered more than
the figures given above. Even in the Italian peninsula, which was more
thickly settled, there was altogether a population of not more than
three and a half millions and a density of only twenty-five per square
kilometer. The Roman legions who opposed the Nervii in this last fight
numbered at least 40,000 men.Dwelling east of the Nervii were the Aduatuci, said to be descendants
of the survivors of the former Cimbri and Teutones, whom Marius had
destroyed. They had promised to help the Nervii, but had come too late
for the battle. Now they withdrew to their chief fortress, but when
they saw themselves being enveloped in the complicated and scientific
siege works of the Romans, their hearts failed and they surrendered
before the final assault was made. What they had not been able to do
openly they hoped to accomplish by treachery, for they reserved a part
of their arms, at the time they made their submission, and when the
Romans were off their guard at night, made a sudden attack upon them.
They were defeated with heavy loss, and the next day, in order to
make an example of them, Cæsar sold the whole tribe, men, women, and
children, into slavery, 53,000 souls in all.After the Belgic campaign was over, Cæsar laid plans for the further
expansion of Roman control in Gaul by sending one of his lieutenants
to Armorica, modern Normandy and Brittany, to secure the submission of
the inhabitants. Moreover, seven legions were placed in winter quarters
along the Loire, ready to use the stream to transport themselves to the
territory of the Veneti, the chief tribe in the west of Gaul. (56 B.C.)The announcement of Cæsar’s great success made a profound impression
in Rome; new and unknown domains were being annexed, and the people
were granted an unprecedented space of fifteen days for a public
thanksgiving. During the winter the general himself took up the
detailed work of governor of the Cisalpine province, and also made a
tour of Illyria, which had been previously unvisited by him. It was
filled with a hardy and brave population and might well be used for
drawing auxiliary troops for his army.In Gaul the situation of affairs showed that the people of Armorica
could not be depended upon, though they professed loyalty to the
Romans. Young Crassus, who commanded a garrison encamped at the mouth
of the Loire, when he found his soldiers suffering from lack of
supplies, sent some of his officers to collect provisions from the
neighboring districts supposedly friendly. The Veneti seized these men,
and refused to give them up except in exchange for their own hostages
in the hands of the Romans, and they proceeded to bind themselves
together for common action, showing their desire to repudiate the
sovereignty of Rome. Cæsar’s reply to the challenge was to order the
preparation of a fleet of ships to be put into service the following
summer against the Veneti, whose chief seats were along the sea coast.It was not possible for Cæsar to direct these operations in person,
for affairs in Rome demanded his presence on the southern side of
the Alps. Clodius had mismanaged the affairs of the democratic party
in Rome, had proved headstrong, had alienated Pompeius, and had
been unable to prevent the return of Cicero from exile. The cause
of the senatorial oligarchy was progressing, and a danger point was
reached when Crassus drew away from Pompeius, of whose popularity
he was jealous, and when Pompeius himself felt that his talents and
his position as conqueror of the East were not being sufficiently
recognized. Cato, too, was returning from Cyprus, and could be relied
upon to give the triumvirs trouble in his rôle of professional
obstructionist.As there was talk already in Rome of the recalling of Cæsar, a
consultation between the triumvirs was imperatively needed. Lucca in
Tuscany was selected for the place of meeting, which took place in
April, 56. A great crowd of officials, magistrates, and senators were
present to receive orders from the triumvirs or to hear particulars of
the conference. Cæsar by his diplomacy managed to remove the causes of
estrangement between Crassus and Pompeius, and the details of a common
policy were arranged. By the conference at Lucca, through the adroit
manipulation of Cæsar, the old combination that had begun to work
haltingly, owing to the estrangement between Crassus and Pompeius, and
also to their common lack of political acumen, was re-established and
its details settled.The main thing was to muzzle the Senate; with this done, it would be
safe for Pompeius and Crassus to carry out their plans for securing
an important province each, together with a military command for a
long term of years. The arrangement was that the other two triumvirs
(Cæsar of course returning to finish the subjugation of Gaul) should
be Consuls in 55; and after their year of magistracy was finished,
Pompeius was to have the two provinces in Spain, and Crassus was to
go to the East, where there would be a chance of achieving military
distinction in a war with the Parthians. In the local affairs of Rome
care was taken that Clodius should be kept from continuing his line of
irresponsible action, and Cicero was drawn into the sphere of Cæsar’s
influence by his brother being given a subordinate military command in
Gaul.Cæsar, when the conference was over, soon returned to the front, to
deal with the Veneti in such an effective way that by their example the
Gallic tribes might be taught the risks of braving the power of Rome.
Divisions of the army were sent to various points of Gaul, where it
seemed likely there might be sympathetic uprisings of the populations
in favor of the national movement, led by the tribes about the Loire.
The Veneti had against them Cæsar himself, and the problem of their
subjugation offered some novel difficulties. Their fortified places
were usually on headlands; sometimes inaccessible from the mainland
except by ship. The country was cut up by many estuaries, and the
Veneti, who were practised sailors, showed great mobility in their
movements. They withdrew from one post to another, easily cutting
themselves off from attack as the Romans, who were not familiar with
the country, advanced to meet them with the hope of forcing a decisive
engagement. Their power could be destroyed only in a naval battle, and
it required both patience and ingenuity on Cæsar’s part before his men
could be trained to meet the enemy in their own waters, or even before
a fleet could be built suitable to overcome the special difficulties of
navigation on the shores of the Bay of Biscay, so unlike the conditions
in the Mediterranean. The fleet of the Veneti was finally destroyed;
their ships were rendered helpless when the men on the Roman fleet cut
their rigging with long poles having at the end sharp hooked knives,
and boarding parties disposed of the warriors on the decks. Many of the
brave tribe were put to death when they submitted, and the rest were
sold as slaves.In the meantime the operations of the subordinate commanders had been
successful, and conspicuous results had been reached in Aquitaine,
where the younger Crassus had brought all the tribes to accept Roman
sovereignty. Indeed the only failure to be registered this year was
Cæsar’s own expedition in the far northern part of Gaul between the
Somme and the Rhine, the dwelling place of the Morini and the Menapii.
These tribes took refuge in their forests and could not be dislodged,
and even some incidental defeats failed to break their obstinacy.The new year, as it opened, with news of a German invasion on a large
scale, brought fresh anxieties to the commander. It was told him that
warlike tribes living in and about the Thuringian forest were on the
move towards the west, and that others had even crossed the Rhine,
dispersing the Gallic tribes in their progress. In Gaul there was a
disposition in some quarters to welcome them as deliverers; already
some of the Gallic tribes were in communication with them on a friendly
basis. (55 B.C.)Cæsar marched to meet the Germans, and in a conference with their
leaders told them they must leave Gallic territory, at the same time
offering to make an arrangement by which they could receive land on
the right bank of the Rhine. They seemed disposed to accept these
terms, but soon hostilities were precipitated because, while the terms
were being discussed, the Germans attacked some of the Gallic cavalry
attached to Cæsar’s army. The Romans moved suddenly, and according to
Cæsar’s own account, butchered in cold blood men, women, and children
to the number of 430,000, a hearsay number of course, but there is no
reason for doubting that there was a massacre. No Roman was killed and
few were wounded. Even in Rome, notoriously insensible to deeds of
blood, this wholesale butchery caused disgust. Cato proposed that Cæsar
should be given up to the barbarians as an act of justice. But the
Senate contented itself with decreeing honors for the victory, although
it was proposed, but not carried, that the operations in Gaul should be
investigated by a commission.To finish up the moral effect made on the Germans by the massacre of
their kinsmen, Cæsar built a trestle across the Rhine, transported his
army into German territory, and for a short time his soldiers were
employed in laying waste the country contiguous to the river. He had
no intention of penetrating to the interior of the country, and soon
returned to Gaul, after destroying the bridge he had built.This year’s campaign had been marked by daring adventures; it was to
have a spectacular close in the expedition to Britain, an island known
in a general way to traders from Gaul, but never yet visited by a Roman
official or by a Roman army. Cæsar affected to believe that resistance
to Roman rule in Gaul was being supported from Britain. In any case a
protectorate of the island seemed to offer great material advantages,
for exaggerated reports were in circulation as to its wealth and
fertility. The expedition was only a partial success. A few tribes made
their submission, but the troops had to be hastily withdrawn, because
Cæsar desired to be back on the mainland before the equinoctials set
in, as the fleet had already severely suffered in a storm.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'In the winter preparations were made on a large scale for a second
crossing, a large body of transports being prepared and collected at
Portus Itius (perhaps Wissant, near Cape Grinez). The troops in the
meantime were carefully trained in handling newly constructed vessels
specially planned for the waters of the narrow seas. During the winter
the periodic signs of disaffection among the Gauls were again plainly
visible, this time the Treviri were intriguing with the Germans. An
advance in force from Cæsar was needed to put a check to the rising
hopes of the anti-Roman party, whose chief, Indutiomar, was forced to
give hostages for his good behavior. Much discontent was caused by the
necessity of sending contingents to the army; besides, the legions were
a burden on the food supplies of the land. The feeling against foreign
control grew so strong that Cæsar determined to take some of the Gallic
chiefs with him to Britain, to keep them under personal observation.
Dumnorix, the Æduan, tried to secure common action among all and to
induce the other chiefs not to embark. Only Dumnorix, however, withdrew
when the fleet was about to sail. A party was sent back to pursue him.
When he resisted, he was slain.The second expedition to Britain was on an unprecedented scale. There
were five legions, two cavalry troops, and an armada of 800 vessels to
carry them. The British tribes withdrew from the coast, and there was
some fighting, as the Romans made their way inland to attack various
British strongholds. Some of the tribes submitted, but the Roman
victories were more apparent than real; the camp around the fleet was
attacked, and as the army returned, it was continually harassed by an
active enemy, who dogged each stage of the march, but refused to come
out and fight in the open. The chief result of the invasion was the
collection of reliable information about the people and their customs.
The island was not occupied or formally conquered for nearly a century.
The captives that were taken were brought over to the continent and
sold as slaves. (54 B.C.)When the expedition returned, the troops were distributed through Gaul
in winter quarters as camps of observation, not more than a hundred
miles from one another; Cæsar’s own headquarters being at Amiens. The
scene of the first disturbance was in the northeast; a Roman garrison
on the march from one camp to another was cut off, and only a few
stragglers were left to tell the tale. Cicero’s brother Quintus, the
commander of another garrison, was attacked, and no message could be
got through the hostile tribes of the Nervii to tell Cæsar of his
desperate straits. Finally news was carried by means of a Gallic slave
whose master, a Nervian refugee, promised him his liberty if he were
successful.Cæsar, with one legion and with a division of horsemen, arrived just
in time to save the beleaguered garrison. The Gauls were severely
handled when the Romans pushed through their lines to reach Cicero’s
camp. The news of the relief caused dejection among the other Gallic
tribes, who were about to attack isolated Roman garrisons. Labienus
alone had trouble with the Treviri, but managed to ward off the blow,
inflicting upon them in turn a crushing defeat, and slaying their
leader, Indutiomar. The rest of the winter and summer campaign was
spent in various expeditions directed against the Gallic tribes whose
loyalty was suspected. It was designed to make a special example of the
Eburones, who had cut off the Roman legion the preceding year. They
were doomed to destruction, and the neighboring tribes were invited to
come and enjoy the plunder. Some of those who came preferred to attack
the Romans first, and Cicero’s camp again fared badly by a sudden
raid, made by the Sigambri, a German tribe, who had crossed the Rhine,
invited by the prospect of plundering the Gauls. This mistake confused
the whole original scheme, and it resulted in the escape of the leader
of the Eburones, Ambiorix, an implacable foe of Rome.When the winter of 53-52 came on, Cæsar’s sojourn in the Cisalpine
province was passed during a season of much anxiety. Rome had been
disturbed by factional fights between Clodius and his opponent,
Milo, in which the popular demagogue met his death. There had been a
drawing together of the senatorial party, and Pompeius, who was now
looked upon as the chief bulwark against anarchy, had been intrusted
by the Senate with extraordinary powers, enabling him to call for a
general levy of men of military age throughout Italy. Julia, the wife
of Pompeius, was dead, and with her vanished the one strong personal
link between the two triumvirs, for Crassus had perished in the East
fighting against the Parthians. The news of the troubles in Italy
spread rapidly in Gaul, causing the restless tribes there to believe
that Cæsar would be kept on the southern side of the Alps, and that,
with the commander-in-chief away, there would be no trouble in bringing
about a successful revolt, provided there were common action throughout
the whole country. The essential condition was to unite all the
Gauls against Roman control, and this had already in a large measure
been accomplished by the king of the great tribe of the Arverni,
Vercingetorix, now at the head of a confederation extending over the
whole of the central part of the country. It was difficult to overcome
the particularistic tendencies of the Gauls, but this new chieftain at
least understood the difficulties and made a brave effort to counteract
them. He showed also a sense of the strategical needs of the situation
by advising the Gauls to make use of their superiority in cavalry and
to cut off the Roman communications; another feature of his scheme was
to lay waste the country and force the Roman garrisons to withdraw as
they were gradually starved out.A necessary part of the program was the fighting of a decisive battle
on a large scale. Vercingetorix had the men at his command, for he had
won over the Ædui, who from the first had aided the Romans in their
conquests. Cæsar’s plan was to take the various tribal strongholds
one by one; he succeeded in the case of Avaricum, the capital of the
Bituriges. He then sent Labienus against Lutetia with four legions,
while he advanced with six to lay siege to the chief city of the
Arverni, Gergovia. Cæsar’s army was not strong enough for the task; the
plan of attack failed, and the Roman legions were saved only by a quick
junction with Labienus.The whole army was soon withdrawn from central Gaul in order to
protect the Roman province from attack and also to secure for Cæsar
a position where he could establish a fortified camp, from which it
would be difficult to be dislodged, and where he could depend upon a
regular source of supplies. He selected a place on the Saône, where
he could threaten the Æduan territory and be so protected that it
would be dangerous for Vercingetorix to follow him. On the march the
Romans were vigorously attacked by the Gallic cavalry, but, as they had
with them a detachment of German horse, they were beaten off, and the
Romans quickly turned the tables, pursuing the Gallic army and finally
enclosing it in a hill town, Alesia (Alise Ste. Reine).Preparations were now made for a long siege. It was a complicated
affair, because Cæsar had to provide against attacks both from the
beleaguered army and from the Gauls, who were hastening to aid their
natural champion. The lines of contravallation were sixteen kilometers
long, those of circumvallation twenty; the space between the Roman army
and the town was filled with artificial obstacles, meant to prevent
the successful use of infantry. The force under Cæsar numbered about
70,000 men and included eleven legions. Cæsar reports that there were
80,000 men imprisoned in Alesia, while to the Gallic relief army is
assigned 250,000 infantry and 8000 cavalry. Probably there were not
more than 20,000 men altogether in Alesia, for provisions were scarce.
This is the number that Napoleon I would give to the inclosed army,
and he further remarks that the relief army in its manœuvering and in
its camping operations behaved as if it were equal, not superior in
strength, to its adversaries.Cæsar had five or six weeks of leisure before the relieving army
appeared. The first part of the decisive engagement was marked by a
cavalry battle, in which Cæsar’s German horse proved superior to the
Gauls. Then a night attack on the inclosing lines was tried and failed.
A daylight struggle afterwards took place along the weakest part of
the Roman fortifications, Vercingetorix and the relief force making
coincident attacks. The Gauls from the outside were driven off by a
skilfully delivered movement on their flank, executed by Labienus,
which forced them to withdraw, and at the same time Vercingetorix
moved back into the city, and soon recognizing his hopeless position,
surrendered. The fall of Alesia marks the completion of the Gallic
wars. The spirit of the Gauls was broken; there were afterwards various
punitive expeditions, but with the collapse of the great rebellion the
country became pacified and accepted its position as a Roman dependency.
IV THE BREAK WITH POMPEIUS AND THE SENATE
Cæsar’s government of Gaul was now drawing to its close. He had added
to the Roman dominions a territory larger than the two original
provinces assigned to him. The question now was, what next? The
precedents on this point were clear enough; they were written large
in the lives of other recent conquerors, Marius and Sulla. But the
senatorial party had no intention of allowing Cæsar to return to Rome
with a free hand; it was to be a struggle between the self-interests
of a narrow oligarchy and a clear-headed effort to attain personal
control of the machinery of the government. On neither side was regard
for legality given much weight. Both Cæsar and the senatorial party
used without scruple illegal means; both at the same time claimed
hypocritically to represent the side of law and order.As a matter of fact, the old governmental methods of the Republic were
adapted only to the conditions of a city community with a homogeneous
population. There had been a breakdown years before Cæsar’s time, and
the question now was who should benefit from this chaotic situation.
The senators meant to get Cæsar out of Gaul, reduce him to the ranks
of a private individual, and then ruin him by some legal prosecution
in connection with his eight years of provincial rule. The chief
asset of the Senate was Pompeius’ jealousy of Cæsar as a rival of his
military glory; he was soured because he could not get the position
and the influence for which his early record had marked him out.
Pompeius was proconsul of Spain, according to the arrangement made at
the last meeting of the triumvirs. It was only carried out nominally;
he had no intention of losing his control of Rome, a control which
depended on his presence at the center of affairs. Contrary to all
precedent, he governed his province by means of deputies. He was also
in special charge of the corn supply, a position valuable as a means
of propitiating the people with votes. He arranged to have a five-year
extension of his proconsular power in Spain, and his influence on the
Senate is shown by their willingness to allot him 100 talents a year
for the maintenance of his troops. He used his patronage exclusively
to advance his own personal interests, oblivious of the compact with
Cæsar, showing altogether that, while he meant to stand outside the
law, the chicanery of legislation could well be used to block the path
of his rival.Cæsar, who had not forgotten to retain the favor of the Roman populace
by entertainments and benefactions, and who had all the skill of a
party boss in retaining the allegiance of friends and followers, had
three very strong allies back of him, leaving aside his natural
superiority in capacity and in shrewdness to Pompeius. His conquest of
Gaul, followed as it was by a very judicious treatment of the conquered
tribes, gave him the support of a warlike population ready to act on
his behalf. Moreover, the reduction of the country had unlocked a
store of wealth, which was naturally in his hands; the slaves alone,
collected from the captives, represented as capital a very large sum of
money. Then there were the seasoned legions on whose loyalty he could
depend.The rival claims of the two leaders reached an acute stage when
Pompeius, now Consul, passed legislation by which an interval of five
years was required between service as a provincial governor and as a
magistrate in Rome. Cæsar’s term of office expired in B.C. 49; he had
received leave to stand for the consulship and had requested to be left
in possession of his provinces till the end of 49. Now in Pompeius’
legislation there was required, unless special permission were given,
personal candidature, and also the Senate was given authority to
relieve provincial governors at any time during the last year of their
service. Cæsar might find himself relieved of his proconsulship before
he had been elected Consul. It would be a dangerous position for him to
confront a rival armed with extraordinary powers, while he was only an
individual citizen. There were further grounds of irritation because
the senatorial party refused to recognize certain administrative acts
of Cæsar, by which he had extended the franchise to various provincial
towns. In arranging the question of provincial succession there was
much delay. Pompeius hesitated to accept the Senate’s drastic measure,
by which Cæsar would be relieved long before he could be elected
Consul. He made a show of conciliation by shortening the interval and
also by promising to resign his own command before the expiration of
his term if the Senate so desired. Cæsar’s agent in Rome, the Tribune
Curio, displayed much ingenuity in obstructing all measures aimed at
his chief, and it was plain from the way the political game was being
played that Cæsar’s minimum, service as Proconsul till the end of
49, and entrance into the consulship on January 1, 48, would be the
watchword of his partisans. In all other respects he showed himself
ready for conciliation and compromise. When two legions were asked for
the Parthian war, they were promptly sent, and no protest was made at
their being kept at Capua, when they were no longer wanted in the East.
Curio, too, was ordered to cease blocking the vote of money to pay
Pompeius’ troops.But the senatorial party were not ready to make terms; it seemed to
them that with the co-operation of Pompeius they could place Cæsar
in an _impasse_. They miscalculated his personal popularity and his
military strength, and now were all the more confident, because they
were successfully intriguing with Labienus to detach him from his chief.The weakness of the senatorial clique was its obvious insincerity in
claiming to be the representative of the party of law and order. It was
absurd to object to Cæsar stepping directly from the proconsulship to
the consulship as an irregularity, when Pompeius had held both offices
together; indeed he had been twice Consul within four years, entirely
in contravention of the required legal interval of ten years between
the holding by one individual of the highest magistracy.Marcellus, one of the Consuls in B.C. 51, a determined opponent of
Cæsar, brought matters to a climax by denouncing Cæsar in the Senate
as a brigand and asking that he should be called a public enemy unless
he gave up his province by a fixed date. These motions were made as a
result of the debate whether a successor to Cæsar should be appointed;
they were carried by an imposing majority. An equal majority rejected
the motion that Pompeius should be required to resign.Curio, who had as Tribune interposed his veto on the first motion, then
offered a resolution by which both commanders should be required to
resign. This was carried by 322 to 320, but no effect was given to it;
probably it was vetoed by a Pompeian Tribune. Through private channels,
efforts were being made to prevent a break between the two rivals; on
account of Pompeius’ well-known indecision of temper, the senatorial
clique resolved by a bold stroke to prevent further negotiations.
Marcellus, on the 9th of December, using as a pretext the rumor that
Cæsar was on his way to Rome with his army, tried in vain to get the
Senate to declare Cæsar a public enemy and to authorize Pompeius to
take command of the troops in Italy and protect the state. Indignant
at the timidity of the senators, he took matters in his own hands,
virtually declaring war on his own responsibility, for he handed over
the two Italian legions to Pompeius, with the command to march against
Cæsar. Pompeius, though this action of the Consul was unconstitutional,
accepted the commission; at the end of the month he was still confident
that Cæsar would drop his claim to the consulship and that so peace
would be restored.Cæsar acted cautiously; he sent for additional troops from Gaul and
also despatched a message to the Senate offering to resign all his
provinces and his army, provided Pompeius would do the same. In case of
refusal, he said he would be compelled to take measures for asserting
his own rights and the freedom of the Roman people. Curio was sent with
this ultimatum to Rome; it was only with difficulty that the letter was
read. A motion was passed that at a fixed date Cæsar should give up his
army and that his non-compliance would be treated as an act of war.
There was, of course, the usual obstruction from Marcus Antonius, a
Cæsarian Tribune; the final decree by which martial law was introduced
and the magistrates called upon to see “that the commonwealth took no
harm,” was not passed till the seventh of January. (49 B.C.) Lentulus,
the Consul, in the meantime had advised the obstructing tribunes to
leave the city if they valued their personal safety. It was this verbal
threat which put in Cæsar’s hands the very useful plea that he was
acting as the defender of the freedom of the Roman people.The military strength of the two parties was, from the senatorial
point of view, altogether on their side; they had, they reasoned, the
whole empire to draw upon for recruits, while Cæsar had only his own
province. The difficulty of the senatorial position was, that their
forces were not together when the war broke out. Of Cæsar’s original
thirteen legions, two were now under Pompeius’ command; besides this,
the latter had in Spain seven legions of well-seasoned troops; in Italy
he had the two legions already mentioned, which originally belonged to
the army of Gaul; and another in a state of creation.Cæsar’s chance lay in prompt action, in administering a decisive
defeat before Pompeius could get his scattered men together. While
the negotiations were in progress, he had only one legion in northern
Italy; but two had been sent for, and when they were at hand Cæsar
had, with his allies, about 20,000 men, a force considerably superior
to that of Pompeius, who was especially careful not to lead Cæsar’s
old legions against their former commander. With one legion of newly
recruited men he could do nothing; the consequence was that in Italy
there was practically no resistance to Cæsar’s advance. When some of
the newly created cohorts joined him, the senators with their commander
fled to Greece.The moral effect of the abandonment of Italy and the capital was a
great asset for the Cæsarian party. The critics have condemned Pompeius
because he failed to relieve the senatorial troops inclosed by Cæsar in
the town of Corfinium in the Abruzzi. It was a discouraging blow at the
very commencement of the struggle for the senatorial party to see their
soldiers and one of their chief partisans, Domitius Ahenobarbus, left
to their fate. But Pompeius was in no position to give help; if he had
attempted to give aid, he would have been defeated and captured.Instead of pursuing Pompeius across the Adriatic to Greece, Cæsar
turned away to the conquest of Spain. Even if transports were lacking,
he might have doubled round the Adriatic coast through Illyria, his
own province. He might soon have got the control of the entire East
before a sufficient force was collected to oppose him. But if he had
done so, in the meantime Italy would have been exposed to an invasion
from Pompeius’ Spanish veterans, for the senatorial commander would
undoubtedly have betaken himself there and acted on the offensive.
By the time Cæsar could reach Antioch, in Syria, Pompeius could have
occupied Rome. Cæsar therefore consistently followed the principle of
striking at the enemy’s force where it was concentrated and prepared
for effective work.Several of the legions newly formed from Italian recruits were sent to
Sardinia, Sicily, and Africa as crucial points, from which a descent
might be made on Italy; others were left in Italy itself. Of the
veteran legions from Gaul, three were despatched to Marseilles, which
had taken the senatorial side, and six were taken to Spain. There
were seven Pompeian legions in the peninsula under three different
commanders, Afranius and Petreius in the north, Varro in the south.
Varro, the celebrated antiquarian and scholar, was not an enthusiastic
partisan of Pompeius; there seems to be no reason, except his desire
to be neutral, why he should have weakened the Pompeian forces in
the north by keeping his legions in the south. In any case, the five
legions near the Pyrenees, as if conscious of their weakness, remained
on the defensive, although for a time they were opposed only by two
legions of Cæsar’s.Cæsar’s force was undoubtedly numerically superior, for there was a
considerable contingent of allies, German and Gallic, both horse and
foot. The plan of strategy adopted by the Pompeians was to keep Cæsar
in check until Pompeius’ preparations in the East were completed, that
is, to wait until he could come to Spain to direct the operations there
in person, or could make a diversion by attacking Italy with the troops
raised in the East. No attempt was made by Pompeius’ lieutenants to
stop Cæsar’s passage through the mountain passes of the Pyrenees. This,
in any case, would have been a questionable operation and apt to cause
a division of strength in the opposing army.The first point of conflict between the two armies was at Ilerda, 150
kilometers south of the Pyrenees and about forty north of the Ebro.
There was a stream in front of the town, crossed by a stone bridge,
and near this stream, on a height south of the town, the Pompeians
placed their camp. They were well supplied with provisions; and they
commanded the access to the bridge. As the stream had a strong current
and was liable to the sudden changes of a mountain torrent it would
be unsafe for Cæsar to make a temporary bridge to keep in contact
two separated portions of an enveloping army. Cæsar could not afford
to leave this strongly encamped force in his rear, for the way would
be open to them to invade both Gaul and Italy. In case of defeat the
Pompeians might make a further stand, with an advantageous position on
the banks of the Ebro.For some time the Cæsarian army under Fabius remained inactive before
Ilerda. Two bridges had been built across the stream, but one of these
the current had carried away, and at one time two of the legions
were in considerable danger while they were foraging on the southern
bank. When Cæsar took over the command both bridges had gone, and the
Pompeians, by using the stone bridge, could prevent any further bridge
building. Food supplies from the north were cut off, and the Cæsarians
were hard-pressed for provisions, having exhausted all the food in
the neighborhood of their camp. Cæsar managed finally to relieve
this trying situation by building a bridge outside the range of the
operations of the Pompeians, who never dared to get too far away from
their camp. His next move was to try to cut them off from the city,
their base of supplies, but this failed. They were secure where they
were, but they grew alarmed when some of the native population joined
Cæsar’s forces; there was also a prospect of a period of low water in
the river, when Cæsar could use a ford and so completely envelop them.Under such conditions they resolved to abandon their camp and retire
to the Ebro to make there another stand. The retreat was accomplished
without much difficulty, except from cavalry attacks, which delayed
their progress toward the river, which they would have reached five
miles south of Ilerda. They had covered most of this distance when
Cæsar’s legions suddenly appeared ready for attack. In spite of the
difficulty of crossing the stream at Ilerda, Cæsar’s men with great
valor had braved the dangers of the swift current and had marched
with such rapidity that they caught up with the Pompeians before
sunset. Afranius and Petreius soon found themselves outmanœuvered by
their opponents, the way to the river being closed to them. The only
alternative now was to fight or surrender. After some hesitation,
perhaps due to divided counsels in their own camp, they abandoned the
attempt to reach the Ebro and returned to their original camping ground
at Ilerda. (August, 44 B.C.)Cæsar, in the meantime, held his hand, though his soldiers earnestly
wished for a pitched battle under such favorable circumstances. It was
a civil war, and Cæsar had no taste for the kind of butchery practised
on the barbarians in Gaul on so many occasions. The Pompeian commanders
soon capitulated; the best force of his opponents had now by Cæsar’s
superior strategy been put out of action, as effectively as if it
had been beaten on the battlefield. Such a victory is practically
unique in military annals. The Roman army at Trasimene and at Cannæ,
the Prussians at Jena, and the French in 1870-71 were annihilated as
military units, but only after hard-fought battles.Cæsar in this brilliant campaign of forty days deprived his antagonists
of an entire and efficient army without striking a blow. He was all the
time ready to fight, and the absence of a battle was due to the fact
that the commanders on the other side were completely out-generaled.
The operations followed one another with the system of moves on a chess
board. The losing party saw the uselessness of a fight and the victor
had no desire to shed blood needlessly.Easy terms were imposed upon the vanquished; the only conditions
made being that Afranius and Petreius should dismiss their troops on
the way back to Italy. Varro, in southern Spain, who had none of the
temperament for command, and who was waiting to see which was the
winning side, soon found himself deserted by the provincials; even
Gades, where he had contemplated making a resolute stand, declared for
Cæsar. The most serious feature of the campaign in the West was due to
the obstinate resistance of the people of Marseilles; they held out
for several months and surrendered only when they were exhausted by
pestilence and famine. With this siege ended, Cæsar was free to return
to Italy.In general, the first stage of the war was in favor of the Cæsarians;
Sicily had been abandoned by Cato, and the only dark spot on the record
was the decisive defeat in Africa of Curio, who had unwisely attacked
the Pompeians near Utica while they were being aided by a Numidian
king. On the way to Rome Cæsar had to handle a case of mutiny in one
of the legions, the ninth. The soldiers complained of the strict
discipline under which they were kept, as no plundering was allowed.
A signal example was made of them, for the whole legion was disbanded
and the men only taken back on condition that they gave up their
ringleaders. Of these one in ten were taken by lot and executed.During his residence in Rome, in the interval between the first and
second stages of the war, Cæsar was returned as Consul for the coming
year (48), after serving a few days in the extraordinary capacity of
Dictator. Some new legislation was passed, extending the franchise to
provincial populations, and an effort was made to relieve the financial
situation produced by the civil war. Money was scarce, interest was
high, there being, owing to the general uncertainty, a good deal of
hoarding of specie; but nothing was done to encourage the wild rumors
of a revolution after the Catiline model, under which there would be
a general cancellation of debts. Practically the whole administration
of civil affairs was in the conqueror’s hands. Only a few senators
were left, most of them having fled to Pompeius’ camp in Greece, where
their presence was a considerable annoyance to their leader, who found
in them inveterate critics and grumblers, anxious to give advice on
military matters of which they were supremely ignorant.Cæsar’s undivided authority was useful to him; before he left Italy he
had his consular powers enlarged and the city could be left without
fear, as his own partisans were in control. Cæsar’s Spanish victory
had given him, on land, decided superiority over his opponents. He had
now, in addition to the eleven old legions, seventeen new ones, mostly
composed of Pompeian troops, who had transferred their allegiance as
the fortune of war had changed. Two had been lost in the disaster in
Africa under Curio. About half of his whole strength, twelve legions
and 1000 horse, he collected together at Brundisium, intending to sail
from that port and meet Pompeius’ army in Epirus. The rest of his
forces were scattered about in Italy, Sicily, Gaul, and Spain.To oppose to the Cæsarian main army, the senatorial party had only
eleven legions; two of them had originally served under Cæsar, the
rest were recruited in the East or were old units filled out by fresh
additional soldiers. Pompeius’ chief hope, after the defeat of his
army in Spain, lay in the possession of a superior sea power. In this
respect he had decidedly the advantage, for besides the Roman fleet
there were the ships of the dependent Eastern states, while Cæsar’s
ships in the Adriatic had been either captured or destroyed. Cæsar had,
it is true, ordered new ones, but he had no seagoing population to draw
from, to secure sailors. Marseilles, it will be remembered, had taken
sides with Pompeius and had only been captured with difficulty.When Cæsar reached Brundisium, he found there were not enough ships
there to transport his army to the Greek coast. He adopted, however,
the bold plan of using what transports there were, and so, taking
advantage of a favorable wind, carried half his available force, seven
legions and a corps of cavalry, to the other side. The whole operation
took only from twelve to fifteen hours. Pompeius had not brought
his land force to the coast of Epirus, and his fleet, as it was the
winter season, had not counted on Cæsar’s making the passage at that
time. Yet when Cæsar landed, the situation was anything but favorable
for him; Pompeius’ army had reached the principal harbor of Epirus,
Dyrrhachium, and his fleet had destroyed part of the transports and
was keeping vigilant watch to intercept the rest, if they attempted to
leave Brundisium with the legions which remained there. Cæsar was cut
off from his base, but Pompeius dared not attack him, though his army
was numerically superior. The two armies faced one another in inaction,
Pompeius waiting for reinforcements, and Cæsar hoping that there would
be a chance for the rest of his army to join him, although the way
through Illyria was impracticable, the country being mountainous and
the population of uncertain loyalty.On the other hand, the attempt of the Pompeian fleet to blockade
Brundisium failed. After waiting two months, Marcus Antonius succeeded
in making the passage, at a time when weather conditions made it
impossible for the enemy’s ships to interfere with the landing. With
this accession of strength, four legions and additional cavalry,
Cæsar’s force was now superior to that of his opponent; but Pompeius
was strongly intrenched on the shore, close to a city well supplied
with provisions, and by means of his fleet, in communication with the
rest of the world.The problem of supplies on Cæsar’s side was a difficult one, since
the neighboring country was nearly exhausted. It was probably this
reason which induced him to divide his force by sending some three and
a half legions into the interior of the country, partly to intercept
a Pompeian relieving army under Scipio, and partly to operate in
Greece itself with a view of winning adherents for his cause. With the
remainder he proceeded to inclose Pompeius’ camp, not so much to force
a capitulation, which seemed hopeless because at any time they wished
the Pompeian fleet could carry the army away, as to produce a moral
effect on the Pompeians, who would be dispirited everywhere, when they
learned that their leader was not acting on the offensive.The siege operations proved calamitous; Cæsar’s veterans suffered
a severe defeat, and in some places the lines of the inclosing
fortifications were destroyed. The other side, elated by victory, were
now prepared for a decisive battle. This hazard Cæsar declined to take;
instead of this he gave his troops time enough to recover from the
effects of their defeat and then moved off from the coast, taking the
road to Thessaly in order there to join the other detachments of his
army, who were occupied in trying to force Scipio to an engagement.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'He was soon followed by Pompeius, and the great pitched battle of the
year took place on the plains of Thessaly. The two sides were far from
being evenly matched; probably Pompeius had 40,000 legionaries and
3000 cavalry, while under Cæsar there were 30,000 legionaries and 2000
horse. When the armies came in sight of one another, there was some
preliminary manœuvering to get the advantage of a favorable position,
but finally Pompeius advanced some distance from his camp on level
ground, and Cæsar, who was about to march away rather than attack under
unfavorable conditions, decided to give battle. Pompeius’ right wing
rested near a brook with precipitous sides. Relying on this to protect
his flanks, he placed the light-armed infantry and the cavalry, under
the command of Labienus, on the left wing with directions to make a
vigorous onslaught on the troops opposed to them. If the enemy gave
way, they were then to attack the legionaries on the sides and rear; in
the meantime, Pompeius’ own legions were ordered not to advance but to
await, where they were, the attack from the other side. It was hoped
that Cæsar’s men would be in confusion before the hand-to-hand conflict
began, as the distance they would have to traverse was greater than was
usual in the battles of this period.Probably all of Cæsar’s cavalry were disposed in such a way that they
faced the opposing cavalry. In order to compensate for his inferiority
of numbers in this arm, he had trained some of his best legionaries
to fight interspersed with the cavalry, after the practice among the
Germans. The cavalry were separated, too, by a division of 3000 men,
and behind his whole order of battle there was a considerable reserve
force. It was to be supposed that, even without the assistance of this
last support, his seasoned veterans would withstand the enemy for a
long time. This expectation was all the more likely to be realized,
just because of Pompeius’ orders that his own infantry were to be held
back from engagement and should maintain their own ground, while his
cavalry were at work.The battle opened with the cavalry charge on the Pompeian side. Cæsar’s
German and Gallic horse, as they were instructed, withdrew, and as soon
as the Pompeian horse followed them, the 3000 men placed previously
to support them, attacked the Pompeian cavalry in the flank. This
manœuver was immediately followed by a quick action on the part of
Cæsar’s cavalry. They swerved about, attacked in their turn those who
had just been pressing them, and forced them back in confusion. There
was not time enough for Pompeius now to get together a mass of infantry
to protect his cavalry. The hand-to-hand conflict immediately began,
Cæsar’s whole force of infantry throwing themselves on the opposing
legionaries, who now no longer had the support of their cavalry. The
pressure on the front and sides was too much for the Pompeians; first
the left wing gave way and then the entire army. (August 8, 48 B.C.)The crucial feature of the whole battle was Cæsar’s skilful disposition
of the 3000 men, placed, as some authorities describe it, in a kind
of ambuscade. It was this that upset the whole plan of Pompeius’
massive cavalry charge. The intelligent manœuvering of the Gallic and
German horse, first giving way, then returning to charge superior
numbers, is an illuminating illustration of the discipline prevailing
in all arms of Cæsar’s force. The close of the battle was followed
by the occupation of the Pompeian camp. The commander himself fled
in deep dejection from Greece, and met his death by an assassin’s
hands, when landing from a boat on the coast of Egypt. As a military
leader he had proved himself in this war unimaginative and sluggish.
He was a master of the technique of warfare, but failed to make use
of his opportunities; he seemed to have worked out his own campaign
in advance, and to have followed the scheme with deliberation, but in
other respects he was resourceless, both when the advantage was his own
and when the enemy made mistakes.With two very much reduced legions and a few horse, Cæsar pursued
his rival to Egypt, where he was too late to take him alive. But the
factional contests in Egypt as to the royal succession and perhaps,
too, the desire to get his hands on the Egyptian treasury, induced the
conqueror to use this opportunity of asserting Roman sovereignty over
the dependent kingdom. It proved to be a rash step, for the Egyptians
were fanatically attached to their autonomous position, and Cæsar’s
small force was in great danger, not only from the Egyptian army, but
also from the turbulent Alexandrian populace, who tried and almost
succeeded in shutting him up in part of the city, and in preventing
supplies and reinforcements coming to him by sea. At times the Romans
were in great danger; there were furious combats in the city and in
the harbor, and it was not till many months had passed that Cæsar was
master of the situation. It took all the resources of his versatile
genius to hold out until large enough reinforcements came from the East
to bring the Alexandrians into subjection.The whole winter after the battle of Pharsalus was spent in this way,
and when the war was over in March, there was three months more delay
in Alexandria, owing, it was said, to the fascination exerted over
the conqueror by the famous Egyptian queen, Cleopatra. During the
summer preparations were made for an extensive expedition throughout
the Farther East with a small body of men, the design being to pacify
the Oriental provinces. This proved not very difficult; most of the
problems were solved by diplomacy and only one battle was fought, that
of Zela, in Pontus, with Pharnaces, king of Pontus, who had taken
advantage of the civil war to try to set up an independent rule over a
large part of Asia Minor.While Cæsar was absent in the East, his cause in the West had been
far from successfully handled by his lieutenants. The Pompeian fleet
had given great trouble on the Italian coast and in the Adriatic Sea.
Affairs in Spain had been hopelessly muddled by a corrupt and tyrannous
governor, who angered the provincials and got into trouble with the
native tribes. In Rome the victory at Pharsalus had been followed
by great activity on the part of the Senate and popular assembly in
heaping additional honors on Cæsar. He was made Dictator with virtually
unlimited powers. The administration, so far as any semblance of
legality was concerned, seemed to have gone to pieces, while Cæsar
was having his troubled experiences in Alexandria. No provision had
been made for filling up the magistracies, and the conduct of affairs
fell into the hands of an irresponsible agitator, Dolabella, Cicero’s
son-in-law, who prepared a social program containing, as its chief
items, canceling of debts and remission of rents. There were serious
riots in the city, the mob becoming so powerful that even the Cæsarian
Senate had to call on Marcus Antonius, Cæsar’s chief local lieutenant,
to suppress the violence by the use of military power.When Cæsar arrived in Italy from the Orient, there was much to be done
and not much time in which to do it, because all the irreconcilable
partisans of Pompeius, trusting in the help of the Numidian king, Juba,
had gathered in Africa, where, since the defeat of Curio, they met with
no opposition in their control of the country. During Cæsar’s stay in
Rome, there were various measures passed, some to relieve the financial
crisis, others to provide against disturbances of public order, while
political rewards had to be distributed to his followers in the way
of nominations to the Senate, or by the creation of additional places
among the magistracies. On account of the government’s embarrassments,
there was a resort to the policy of forced loans, both from individuals
and from communities. The private property of Pompeius and some of his
adherents was sold at public auction, a questionable proceeding which
gave rise to a good deal of unpleasant jobbery among Cæsar’s friends,
who bought the property in, and then, depending on their influence with
their all-powerful master, tried to evade payment. (47 B.C.)More serious than these matters of local politics was the sullenness of
Cæsar’s troops, which developed into open mutiny when they were ordered
to make ready for the coming campaign in Africa. They refused to budge
until the promises of money and land made them before the battle of
Pharsalus were strictly carried out. Cæsar dealt successfully with
the situation; he had no cash to give them, but he discharged them,
calling them citizens and not soldiers, and assured them at the same
time that all of their demands, with back interest, would be paid as
soon as he returned from Africa to celebrate his triumph. The veterans
were placed in a dilemma; they could not turn against Cæsar, for their
hope of reward lay in his success. Most of them were taken back as
volunteers for the African campaign. Before leaving Italy, Cæsar again
arranged to become Consul for the year 46, at the same time making
arrangements for the distribution of provincial charges. One assignment
was especially noteworthy: a pardoned Pompeian senator, Junius Brutus,
nephew of Cato, at the time in arms against Cæsar, was appointed to
Cisalpine Gaul.A year and a half had passed since Pompeius’ defeat at Pharsalus, but
his cause was being energetically upheld in Africa, where his partisans
were making a final stand. It was here that Scipio, Labienus, Cato,
Afranius, and Petreius gathered together with the forces that remained,
ten legions in all, no inconsiderable force in itself; but there
were besides a large contingent of well-trained cavalry and heavy-
and light-armed troops, supplied by Juba, king of Numidia, who was
implacably hostile to Cæsar’s cause, and who meant to use the divisions
of the Romans for the purpose of carving out for himself an independent
kingdom. The only danger point, apart from an attack from Italy, lay
further west, where the two Mauretanian kings, Bocchus and Bogud, acted
together as a check to the power of the Numidians. They were able to
carry out their policy intelligently, because they had the help of a
Roman adventurer, Publius Sittius, suspected of being an accomplice of
Catiline, and for this reason an enemy of the remnant of the senatorial
party in Africa.Cæsar landed in Africa in December with only a small force, and for a
time he had to maintain himself in an intrenched camp on the coast. His
six legions were made up of raw material, and it was impossible for
him to take the offensive, until his veterans, who had been sent for,
arrived. The situation was saved by Sittius, who made a diversion in
the West, and so drew off Juba to the defense of his own kingdom. Among
the provincials, the Cæsarian cause began to be popular, for they saw
in it a protection against the nationalist schemes of Juba. Moreover,
the Roman aristocratic commanders had treated the population of the
province with scant consideration, so there were many desertions to
Cæsar’s side. Owing to the incompetent strategy of his opponents, who
do not seem to have known how to handle their fleet, communications
with Italy were kept open. It was Cæsar’s purpose, after the veteran
legions arrived, to compel Scipio to give battle. This he refused
to do, until his hands were forced. When Cæsar began the siege of
the important seaport town of Thapsus, Scipio was obliged to come to
the rescue, and a pitched battle was fought early in April, in which
the Pompeian force was completely routed. Cæsar’s troops occupied
the enemy’s camp, and despite the entreaties of their commander, a
wholesale butchery by the legionaries followed the fight.The campaign was soon completed. Utica, where Cato commanded the
garrison, surrendered, after their leader, seeing the ruin of his
cause, had committed suicide. Scipio perished at sea, Varus and
Labienus succeeded in making their escape to Spain. Even Juba was
ruined by the misfortunes of his allies, for his own subjects rejected
him on his return, and he and Petreius met deaths by suicide. After
setting the affairs of Africa in order, and annexing the kingdom of
Numidia as a province, Cæsar returned to Rome after an absence from the
capital of 180 days. (46 B.C.)
V CÆSAR SUPREME
With his return begins the period of Cæsar’s full autocratic power in
the largest sense of that term; honors extraordinary were heaped upon
him and the whole machinery of government was in his hands. He was
perpetual Tribune, and so might check all legislation which did not
meet his approval. Moreover, he was made sole Censor, which position
included not only the guardianship of manners and morals, but also gave
him authority over the composition of the Senate, and the even more
valuable supervision of contracts and financial affairs. Besides this
there was the dictatorship and the consulship. No opposition could come
from the religious side, for he was Pontifex Maximus and a member of
all the religious colleges.His position was not so novel as the way he used it. Sulla also had
established personal autocratic rule, and Pompeius, who was looked
to by the conservatives to preserve republican government, had been
completely oblivious of constitutional traditions when they clashed
with his interests. Cæsar did not abdicate as did Sulla, nor did he
hypocritically veil his purposes as Pompeius had done. There was much
ostentatious display in the way of triumphs, festivals, games, and
largesses, to celebrate the conqueror’s victories, nor were deeds of
cruelty absent in the Gallic triumph. Vercingetorix, who had spent
six years in a Roman dungeon, was put to death in accordance with
old-fashioned republican brutality.Some citizens felt disgust at the extravagant expenditure of the
autocrat, but this kind of discontent was not so deep as the resentment
caused among the upper classes by the introduction of a virtual
monarchy. Their point of view is vividly presented in Cicero’s
correspondence during the closing years of Cæsar’s rule. He suffered
all the more intensely because he had to belie his own principles and
live on friendly terms with the man who had destroyed his ideals and
robbed him of his chances of political distinction. Cæsar advanced
oblivious of criticism, safe in the possession of uncontested powers.
There were many things to do, and there was nothing to which he
hesitated to set his hands. It was not a time to follow the maxim,
“quieta non movere.”Among the most difficult problems was the allotment of land to the
discharged veterans. The plan followed was not to establish them in new
colonies, but to incorporate them in existing communities. Apparently
private rights were respected, for no serious complaints are recorded.
A much-needed reform was taken in hand when Cæsar, using his power as
Censor, reduced the number of those who received the dole of corn from
320,000 to 150,000 persons. Equally creditable was the extension of
the Roman citizenship to non-Italians, special classes being chosen
for this privilege, such as medical practitioners and teachers. Other
measures were economic, such as the restoration of customs duties,
or had a social aim like the attempt to extend free labor where
slaves were commonly used. Municipal administration received special
attention, rules being made for the maintenance of streets and lanes,
for the control of wheeled traffic, and to prevent public ground from
being occupied by the erectors of stands and platforms.In general, the exceptional position of the city of Rome was not
preserved; rather, provincial towns were organized after the model of
the imperial metropolis. Probably it was this bold step in reducing
Rome to the level of other towns, a proceeding strictly in harmony with
Cæsar’s consistent and established policy of equal and fair treatment
to the provinces, that led to the idle bit of gossip that he thought of
transferring the capital to the East, to Alexandria or Troy. Criminal
legislation was stiffened by adding to the recognized sentence of
exile forfeiture of property as a penalty. Care was taken that Roman
citizens should not travel abroad for a lengthy period, a provision
probably intended to protect the provincials from the presence of needy
individuals who would make use of official favor for questionable
financial schemes. But perhaps the most striking of all these measures
from the personal point of view was a law restricting the tenure of
provincial governorship. There were to be no more chances open for a
series of campaigns under one leader such as Cæsar had waged in Gaul.Under this personal government there was little place for a Senate
except as a registering body, and Cæsar did not always allow it to
perform even this humble function. It came to have a make-believe
existence. Decrees were drawn up in its name that had actually never
come before it, and the conqueror’s unpopularity with the Senators was
increased by the introduction of new members, who had no aristocratic
traditions to maintain.As an example of the versatility of his mind, no better one can be
given than the fact that Cæsar’s work in bringing order out of chaos
was extended to reorganization of the old Roman calendar, under which
the year lasted only 355 days, and attempts were made to make the
solar and civil years coincide by the occasional introduction of an
intercalary month, a process often guided by political or superstitious
motives. Since experienced scientists from Alexandria were called
on as experts, Cæsar’s reformed calendar of 365-1/4 days with an
intercalating day every fourth year was sufficiently accurate to stand
for centuries, and with a slight correction is still in use in the
civilized world.The machinery of legislation, important and sound as it was, was not
entirely depended upon to reveal the whole policy of the ruler. Cæsar
is said to have explained in his public speeches that his ideal was not
a despotism, but the paternal rule of a father over his children. He
tried to live up to this standard, making a noteworthy display of doing
so by his generous treatment of his adversaries during the period of
the civil war. Some of his most truculent enemies were pardoned by an
act of grace, a treatment which induced Cicero to try his hand again at
the kind of decorative oratory he had displayed in his early panegyric
on Pompeius. Popular as this clemency was, it did not shelter Cæsar
from severe criticism when he renewed his amour with Cleopatra, now
summoned to Rome, it was said on his invitation, and it was supposed
that he was about to marry her, a foreign queen, as the first step to
the attainment, by regular process, of regal power for himself.Invincible as Cæsar was in war, and conciliatory as he was to those who
had served against him, there was still a body of Pompeian partisans in
Spain, Labienus and Cnæus Pompeius among them, who felt that there was
reason for resistance and a chance of success. Cæsar’s governors in
the peninsula had proved incompetent either to hold the loyalty of the
provincials, or to prevent the mutiny of the troops when the Pompeian
leaders appeared on Spanish ground. All they could do was to clamor
for their leader’s presence. He left Rome hurriedly in December, 46.
This, his last campaign, was conducted with an army inferior in numbers
to that of his opponents. It was an arduous struggle, characterized
by conspicuous barbarity on both sides, for neither depended on Roman
legionaries alone. The Pompeians had native allies and liberated
slaves, and both sides were helped by auxiliary troops from the wild
tribesmen of Mauretania. After winning and taking the town of Cordova,
Cæsar forced the eldest son of Pompeius to fight a pitched battle at
Munda. (March 17, 45 B.C.)The two armies met here in a life and death struggle, Cnæus Pompeius
appealing to his men to avenge his father, while Cæsar’s veterans,
responding to the battle cry of Venus the Victorious, the patron
goddess of the Cæsarian house and its mythical foundress, made it
plain that the cause for which they fought was also a personal one.
Neither side could look for quarter; Pompeius had already shown his
temper by cruel dealings with the provincials who had opposed him,
and Cæsar’s men were not likely to deal mercifully with those who had
rekindled the flame of civil war and so deprived them of a well-earned
peace. Both in attack and defense each side showed equal bravery and
obstinacy. For some time the issue seemed dubious; Cæsar to rally
his own men had to take sword in hand and engage in the thick of the
struggle. Finally, when the Pompeians made a change of their order to
help the wing of their army which was being hard pressed by the tenth
legion, the movement gave the Cæsarians a chance to put their opponents
in confusion and finally to flight. On the Pompeian side 30,000 are
reported to have been slain; among the dead were Labienus, Cæsar’s
right-hand man in the Gallic campaign, and Cnæus Pompeius himself, who
escaped from the field but was taken and put to death afterward.Before the return to Italy the affairs of the Spanish provinces
had to be set in order; special favors were distributed to the
loyal communities in the way of franchise or immunities, and this
reconstructive work seems to have been accompanied by financial
exactions. The return to Italy was not made until September, and
for a whole month Cæsar remained outside the walls of Rome. To mark
the victory at Munda there was nothing tangible to do in the way of
increasing the autocratic power of the supreme and all-embracing
magistrate and executive; there were, however, no visible limitations
to the servility of the Senate and Assembly. Fifty days’ thanksgiving,
yearly games commemorative of the victory, special distinctions of
dress, extraordinary honorific titles, a state residence on the
Palatine, built after the model of a temple of the gods; special
statues in holy places connected with communal worship, all these were
voted, and most of them accepted by the conqueror.After the Spanish war, gold and silver coins were minted, having on
one side the laurel-crowned head of Cæsar, with the inscription Cæsar
Imperator, and on the reverse the figure of conquering Venus, lance
in one hand and on the other a Victory. The conqueror was now treated
as being beyond the ordinary human standard. This recognition of
superhuman qualities is made plainer in an inscription, placed under
a relief of Cæsar (introduced on a metallic map of the world), which
reads, “he is a demigod.” The Oriental idea of deification, opposed
as it was to the whole genius of government in Rome, was now adopted
there. With Julius Cæsar began the custom of deifying the supreme ruler
of Rome, and it is significant that, although he refused a ten-year
consulship, he did not protest against this use of religion for the
purpose of adulation.Now that the supreme authority was unassailably placed in the hands of
a single individual, who was protected in its exercise from any legal
opposition in Rome, Cæsar showed no hesitation in taking the full
responsibility of his position. The Western provinces had for some
time been practically under his personal control. He was virtually the
founder and the creator of the Roman Empire in the West. The foundation
laid by him lasted for hundreds of years. But as military lord of
the Roman world he had also to deal with the situation of the East.
There especially the extension of the Parthian rule was dreaded, and
also anticipated, for the moral effect of the defeat of Crassus a few
years before had been immense. Cæsar saw that a war in the East could
alone restore the prestige of Rome, and also that it was not safe to
leave the conduct of such a war in other hands. His plan was first to
conquer the Parthians, and through their territory to reach the Caspian
Sea. Afterwards by the way of the Black Sea he meant to march along
the Danube, where there were wild tribes which had to be taught to
respect the power of Rome, and finally to return to Italy by the way
of Germany. Such was the mighty program now developed in the vision of
the conqueror. In its details it bore the marks of the bold imagination
and the political sagacity which characterized his genius, but the
immediate necessity was to bring the Parthian war to an end, and so
restore confidence on the Eastern frontier. After the return from
Spain the transfer of the bulk of the Roman army to the East was being
prepared for.It was in connection with this purpose that there first arose,
apparently, the idea of conferring on Cæsar the title of king. It
was said that an oracle of the Sibylline Books had declared that
only a king could get the better of the Parthians in war. Such a
designation was especially antagonistic to Roman political principles;
personal rule was tolerated, but not divine right by family descent.
Some preparations had been made for the introduction of this alien
conception by the act of the Senate, according to which the title
“Imperator,” associated directly with the name of Cæsar, should pass
to his legal heir. The road to a succession being now marked out, the
whole question of the title could not long be left undecided. Imperator
was locally understood, but made no claim on subject races. To test
popular feeling, Marcus Antonius offered the Imperator a diadem, the
insignia of royalty. This was refused, but it was noted that the offer
did not call forth the enthusiastic response that was anticipated, nor
was Cæsar’s rejection of the symbol openly deplored. Still, the desire
for some accommodation with the terms of the oracle was not abandoned.
It seemed possible that in Rome Cæsar might bow to public opinion by
employing only the title of Imperator, while in the provinces he could
exercise royal powers and use the royal title. It was supposed that
some arrangement of this sort would be made by a regular decree before
he set out for the Parthian campaign.Opposition was bound to develop at this point from the convinced
republicans in the Senate; they were strongly represented there, and
Cæsar was responsible for their presence. He had gathered about him
men of both parties, making a special effort by his generosity to win
over some of the most convinced of the senatorial partisans who had
followed Pompeius and had fought the victor to the end of the African
campaign. But even Cæsar’s own appointees and adherents were by no
means reconciled to the program which would openly do away with the
republic; they wished it still to exist as an institution, and they
had no wish to provide for the continuance of personal rule beyond the
terms of Cæsar’s own life.The party of Pompeius was by no means inactive; they wrote freely as
apologists for their own side, and they did not hesitate in their
intrigues to hold up Cæsar as an ambitious autocrat guilty of cruelty
on the battlefield, and now that peace was restored, using his claims
to mask his aim to establish a tyranny. These views were found among
the Senators. Cæsar either thought he was unassailable or reckoned on
their gratitude as an obstacle which would separate their theory and
their practice. This attitude was only one example of a general want of
alertness that seemed to characterize the conqueror after the close of
the Spanish campaign.All the old republican antipathies against royalty were called into
life. Cæsar’s statue was now seen on the capitol between the figures
of Rome’s ancient kings. Another statue, that of Lucius Junius Brutus,
the founder of the republic, recalled to men’s minds the quick and
ready method of dealing with kings and tyrants. This old-fashioned
republican doctrine was not lost on a disciple and nephew of Cato,
Marcus Brutus, who had made peace with Cæsar after the battle of
Pharsalus. He claimed to be a descendant of the famous liberator, and
by this very fact had influence in heading any movement against the new
autocratic system. His personal abilities were of a mediocre order; but
he was obstinate and self-consciously vain of his integrity, and could
be paraded as a concrete argument to strengthen the republican cause,
when others might hesitate to take extreme steps.But the real motive power in the organization of the conspiracy against
Cæsar was found in Caius Cassius, also holding prætorian office like
Brutus. The two had not before been friendly, although both were
partisans of Pompeius. Cassius, with his dark and gloomy temperament
and sarcastic tongue, was not likely to accept the sententious
pomposity of his brother Prætor at that high standard of value exacted
by Brutus from his friends. What drew them together was their common
republican sympathies. Brutus was asked by Cassius what would be his
attitude at the next meeting of the Senate when the question of the
royal title would be discussed. Brutus replied that he would not be
present. Cassius said that Brutus’s position as Prætor imposed upon him
the obligation of attending the meeting. At this Brutus answered that
if he went he would defend the cause of liberty.Such was the basis of the understanding between the two, and the
agreement for common action was accepted, not only by the remnant of
the old Pompeian party, but by those as well who called themselves the
partisans of Cæsar. Even Caius Trebonius, who had served the cause of
Cæsar in the city and on the battlefield for many years, agreed that
the freedom of the Roman people was to be preferred to the friendship
of an individual. He had once before spoken plainly to Marcus Antonius
of Cæsar’s ingratitude and of the misfortunes of the republic, but
had found no sympathy. Another of Cæsar’s companions in arms, Tullius
Cimber, felt personally injured because the commander had exiled his
brother.Both sides had grievances. The Pompeians were not to be won by tactful
treatment to accept Cæsar’s schemes, while his own followers often felt
that their allegiance had secured no more favors from him than the open
enmity of his former opponents. All experienced the common pressure of
an exalted and unlimited authority, and were prepared to act together.
The exact details of the conspiracy are obscure; they must have been
arranged between the 15th of February and the 5th of March, on which
date the Senate was to be called together in a building erected by
Pompeius, to decide whether Cæsar was to be allowed to bear outside of
Rome the title of king. The conspirators were at one against accepting
such a proposal.Cæsar seemed not to realize his danger, since he paid no attention to
the warnings that came to him. His mind was filled with the prospect of
the Eastern war. Everyone realized that another victory would render
all opposition unavailing. The conspirators would have to act before
Cæsar could set out for the new campaign. In the plan to be followed
the leading Senators were all accomplices. The way would be easy,
provided Cæsar’s fellow Consul, Marcus Antonius, who could be relied
upon to defend him, were prevented from coming to the Senate. Trebonius
was to see that Antonius was detained and kept occupied elsewhere,
while another of Cæsar’s friends of long standing, Decimus Brutus,
undertook the necessary persuasion of the dictator should the latter
hesitate to come to the Curia.Cæsar, as had been arranged, took his seat in the consular chair; the
place next his was vacant, his colleague not being present. There was
no time to be lost, for Marcus Antonius might appear at any moment.
Tullius Cimber, showing much vehemence, drew near to the Consul, making
a plea for the return of his brother from exile. As Cæsar hesitated,
the prearranged signal for the murder was immediately acted upon.
Cimber with both hands tore apart Cæsar’s toga; at the same time Casca
aimed at his neck a blow which glanced and struck the breast. Cæsar
appears to have thought that it was only an act of personal vengeance
from which he could protect himself. He sprang to his feet, snatched
his toga from the hands of Cimber, and threw himself on the arm of
Cassius, at the same time defending himself with the stylus of his
tablet. He was strong and active, and might have got the better of his
two antagonists, but as he turned on Casca he received a wound in the
side, then several others from the conspirators as they closed in upon
him. No one of the Senators, whom he had created, came to his help. All
was over in a moment, for he made no further resistance when he saw
the arm of Marcus Brutus, specially bound to him by personal favors,
raised to strike. He fell at the feet of the statue of Pompeius, his
body pierced by twenty-three wounds. The corpse was brought back to his
dwelling by three slaves in the litter in which he had been carried to
the Senate. All the rest of his retinue of clients and friends had fled.The assassination, its method of accomplishment, and the men who
planned and carried it out, bound as all of them were by some kind of
obligation to the conqueror, can hardly win sympathy even from those
who hate autocratic rule, and think the man who destroys a democracy
beyond the law. The conspirators had not the personal character of the
traditional tyrannicides of Greece. There is something of a pose in
the whole action. Brutus and his fellows were representing a clique
and cannot be called in any sense the executors of the will of the
people. It would have been more fitting if the old precedent followed
in the legendary expulsion of the former kings of Rome, banishment,
had been adopted here. After all, Cæsar was giving the Roman empire a
better kind of government than the Senatorial oligarchy. The cause of
the conspirators was weak, and the men who carried it out, as events
soon showed, were even weaker than their cause. Only verbally were the
interests of republicanism represented by the murderers of Cæsar. The
Senate and People of Rome existed as they had done of old; but the
elements in each were different. In the people of Cæsar’s days there
was nothing that resembled the ancient community of the plebeians.
Military expansion had long since destroyed the old civil constitution;
the assemblies in the Forum were legal only in name, for they disguised
the irregularities of mob rule, giving opportunities for violence
and corruption on the largest scale. Even the Senate was virtually
a new creation filled with Cæsar’s enemies and certainly incapable
from its membership of preparing a genuine restoration of republican
institutions. It had stood, even before the civil war, at a time when
the oligarchy of wealth and descent had recovered its lost ground
through the patronage of Sulla, for governmental inefficiency.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'The one man with genius and creativeness adequate to restore a
practical republican government was Cæsar himself, and to him
republican ideals meant nothing. He was a realistic statesman, who saw
the road to monarchy as the short cut to good government, and took it
unhesitatingly. At no point in Cæsar’s career is there any evidence
that he believed in anything but personal rule. Alike skeptical of
higher appeals and with a contempt for shams, he never wavered at any
stage in his well-planned pursuit of autocratic power. His fight with
the Senatorial oligarchy, who alone blocked his way, was conducted
with the directness of a military campaign. There was little personal
feeling, for he treated men as pawns, whether they were friends or
enemies. When their power to help or to oppose him was gone, they
were of no significance; so, at the close of the civil war, it was
easy to exercise a clemency or a patronage which meant little. There
was a superficial amiability in these acts which indicated a contempt
of individuals rather than spontaneous humanity. His cold, clear-cut
character seemed to work out problems in a bloodless atmosphere alike
free from prejudices and from prepossessions.Cæsar’s benefactions and his enmities were alike self-centered. The
whole force of a nature extraordinarily versatile and incessantly
active was turned to one end, and the various stages of his political
career are explained by the closing years of his life. It was his
purpose to overthrow the Senatorial aristocrats. The purpose was a most
worthy one, and it is difficult to see how it could have been done
except by extra-legal means, for the Senatorial faction made the laws,
and so held all the cards in their hands. Their motto of government
was “Heads I win, tails you lose”; and the claim of legality with
such a leader as Pompeius, who had no respect for the constitution,
was altogether disingenuous. Cæsar was a shrewder politician than any
member of the Senatorial faction, far more brilliant in conception
and far quicker in action than his rival Pompeius. After clearing the
field of his opponents, he showed less creative capacity than in his
preparatory work.Of course, the time was short between his murder and the close of the
last campaign in the civil war, but the government he established
was a kind of sham republicanism after the Sullan model, only with
a different center of gravity. He seems to have planned a better
system of administration, and meant that it should be worked in a way
regardful of the public interests of a great empire; but the machinery
was to remain the same, except that the various magistracies were
either to be held by himself or filled by men of his own selection. The
shadow of republicanism was to cover a monarchical rule, and in this
respect the conservatism of Cæsar was epoch-making, for it continued to
influence the whole genius of the Roman imperial system for centuries.As a general Cæsar was fortunate in having at his command an army which
represented the result of years of technical training acquired in the
almost continuous campaigns of the Romans. He did not have to create
his army; the material for his conquests was ready to hand. He added
nothing new to the art of war as it was already known, but the legion
under him had a commander of great versatility, who understood how to
use it to the best advantage under any given conditions. This genius
in providing for the maintenance of his army repeatedly gave him the
advantage over the enemy in the Gallic wars, for it enabled him to
defer the decisive engagement until all conditions were favorable for
his own side.Another characteristic of his strategy was his skill in using fortified
camps. He was a born engineer, and the engineering feats of his
campaigns are evidently recounted with great satisfaction in his
“Commentaries.” It is evident that they played a decisive part in
securing success both during the Gallic campaigns and in the civil
war. Indeed, one of the most important contributions of the Romans to
the art of warfare was superior technique in fortifications, and in
protection of camps, aided by which the defensive of a numerically
smaller force could be made to balance the offensive of superior
numbers. The sole method of overcoming such resistance was by starving
out the army placed in a fortified camp. In his campaigns Cæsar showed
remarkable versatility in using the argument of hunger as well as the
argument of the sword, and he was quick to turn from one to the other
as occasion required.He seems never to have burdened himself with a pedantic following of
rules. Plutarch tells us he had read the accounts of Alexander’s great
victories. So far as his own “Commentaries” are concerned, there is a
studied vagueness, which, as has been mentioned, often leaves important
points in obscurity. He is very sparing of giving personal reflections
on the progress of the war he is describing. It is noteworthy,
therefore, that he once blames Pompeius for repressing the enthusiasm
of his troops, saying that it is the general’s business to encourage
the emotional element in battle.He is also fond of calling attention to the rôle played by fortune or
chance, and so he has been often blamed for the risks he was willing
to take because he trusted too much to luck, and it is said that he
conducted warfare in the spirit of a gambler. Like Napoleon, he appears
to have believed in his star, but the references to fortune in the
“Commentaries” are probably a literary device intended to impress
a popular audience who, though they had lost belief in the gods of
polytheism, were ready to recognize an incalculable and mysterious
element in human life.But there was in his strategy more than a spontaneous brilliancy
adequate to rescue him from the difficulties of a position he had not
anticipated. In his campaigns we see evidence enough of caution and
calculation. Especially in the matter of numerical superiority he was
careful not to allow himself any hazards in a decisive engagement.
The battle of Pharsalus is the only one in which it is certain that
he won a victory with an army inferior in numbers to his opponent. In
this case nothing else could have been done, for Pompeius, who was in
control of the sea, would have removed his army from Greece if he had
been outnumbered. There was but one way of forcing a pitched battle
under these circumstances, and it was part of superior strategy to
induce an enemy relying on superior numbers to confront troops superior
in quality. But such chances Cæsar only took when obliged. There was
little of the bravado element in his wars. The situation was outlined
beforehand. The almost mathematical result bears witness to the
presence of that same type of cool reflection which in the political
side of his career makes the founder of the Roman Empire something of
an enigma. It is hard to believe that a man can be just as unfeeling
and unethical in statesmanship as when he is directing the movements of
masses of troops. Cæsar’s genius stands for an abnormal development of
intellectual power disciplined to serve the ambitious purposes of a man
bent on enjoying personal rule, who, to a unique degree, had measured
the capacity of other men and himself.  *  *  *  *  *CHARLES THE GREAT
I INTRODUCTORY
Out of the chaos in Western Europe due to the collapse of Roman
provincial rule in the fifth century, there came into being various
Teutonic states. They all bore the mark of the early tribal
organization of the German peoples and took up the work, more or less
successfully, of assimilating the orderly elements and traditions
of Roman polity. In the Italian peninsula the permanence of these
political creations was short-lived, except in the case of the
Lombards, who maintained an enduring rule, largely because they adhered
to a crude policy of isolation and set well-considered limits to their
desire for expansion. In Spain, the Goths, despite the predominance of
the Roman provincial element, succeeded, with the help of the Church,
in attaining a fairly centralized organization for several centuries
until it was swept aside by the irresistible pressure of the Moslem
conquest. To the North, in France, which was first of all the seat of
various Teutonic peoples, the Franks, under the astute leadership of
their tribal monarchs, gradually absorbed all the territory of the old
Roman province of Gallia, adding to it the land to the east which had
been the home of their ancestors before they had crossed into the Roman
province.Chlodvig, the founder of the Merovingian line of kings, was not a
ruler of the type of Theodoric the Ostrogoth. In contrast with the
Teutonic kingdoms of Italy and Spain, the Merovingian showed a stubborn
conservatism. After Chlodvig’s death there was no man of first-rate
ability during the period of Merovingian rule with the dubious
exception of Dagobert. These were long years of division, lawlessness,
and bloodshed. The Franks kept possession of their conquests, but
the royal line produced a succession of weak and helpless rulers who
showed themselves incapable of casting aside the traditions of tribal
rule. The demand for centralization was recognized and met by the
representatives of the noble family of Heristal who, because they
were landlords over wide estates, became, as mayors of the palace,
_de facto_ possessors of sovereign authority. To them the Frankish
chieftains throughout the land looked for leadership, and did not
look in vain, for their efficient statesmanship soon arrested the
disintegrating tendencies of Merovingian rule, and gave their people
such an amount of cohesive strength that they became the foremost
representatives of Teutonic power in Western Europe. It was the House
of Heristal which saved the Franks from the fate of the Visigoths,
for it was Charles the Hammer who met the Moslem host on the field of
Poictiers and swept them back across the Pyrenees.Charles’ son, Pippin, carried on the work of his father; he was strong,
courageous, and cautious, a thorough type of the opportunist statesman,
willing so far as he was concerned to control his people under the
title of Mayor of the Palace, while the titular dignity of king was
kept intact in the Merovingian family. The bloodless revolution which
made Pippin a monarch _de jure_ from a ruler _de facto_, was due to
outside pressure, and this pressure came from the See of Rome, which
appealed to him for help as the representative and most powerful
Catholic leader in Western Europe after the Emperors at Constantinople
had alienated the population in Italy by the part they played in the
Iconoclastic controversy.The Popes of the eighth century, seeing the inability of the Eastern
Empire to protect its Italian possessions, and unwilling to give them
support against the aggressions of the Lombards, were face to face with
a difficult problem. They did not wish to be absorbed in the Lombard
kingdom, and were just as much afraid of seeing any restoration of
power to the hands of the Emperor’s representative, the Exarch of
Ravenna.Pope Stephen played a bold stroke of genius when he crossed the Alps to
ask the ruler of the Franks to save the religious capital of Western
Christianity from capture at the hands of the Lombard kings. Nor was
his political sagacity yet exhausted, for he persuaded the Mayor of
the Palace to regularize his own position by taking the title of king
under the sanction of the Holy See. This was an ambitious design,
unprecedented in the earlier pages of Papal history. Even Gregory the
Great had no thought of bestowing the royal crown on any Teutonic
tribal chieftain. The action was evidently suggested by the plan
prepared some years before, when, with the coöperation of the Pope, it
was proposed to revive in Italy a native Italian emperor to lead the
people of the Peninsula against the church policy of Constantinople.
This scheme was from the beginning a forlorn hope, and it had turned
out to be a failure. There was not sufficient military strength in
Italy, apart from the Lombards, to back up a revived Emperor of the
West, and it is clear that the Lombards would have made short work of
any such ruler, even if there had not been among the Italians a party
who looked up to the Exarch of Ravenna as the natural head of their
civil government.The negotiations with Pippin ended successfully. The Pope’s prestige
was enormously increased. Instead of looking forward to becoming the
captive of a Lombard king, he became himself the bestower of royal
dignity on a man who had at his disposal such vast military power that
the passage of his army across the Alps into Lombard territory brought
about the reduction of the Lombard kingdom to a status of dependency on
a Frankish ruler.Pippin, as a loyal churchman, followed the Pope’s counsel, but he
seems to have done so with distinct reservations. The traditional
Frankish policy had been the complete subordination of the Church
to the State. It is no wonder then that many of the Frankish nobles
disapproved of Pippin’s act, which reduced their monarchy to a gift
from the hands of the Pope. Pippin did all he could during the rest
of his lifetime to keep clear of further Italian complications. He
never crossed the Alps again, and he was very careful not to depress
the Lombard power in Northern Italy and so give Stephen an excuse
for demanding additional territory. As a temporal ruler the Pope’s
authority had been substantially increased by the cession of lands
which he had claimed from him on the basis of the so-called Donation
of Constantine--a fictitious instrument which Stephen appealed to
when there arose the question of the disposition of the territory
once belonging to the Exarchate of Ravenna. According to the legend,
Pope Sylvester, the contemporary of Constantine, when the capital of
the Empire had been removed to Constantinople, had received from the
Emperor extensive donations of Italian territory, both on the Peninsula
and on the adjacent islands, over which he was to rule with the power
of a temporal sovereign. To Pippin, this legendary Donation, because of
its presumed sanction at the hands of a revered Emperor and Pope, was
sacred. He was willing to be an instrument in carrying out the terms of
the sacrosanct compact, but he refused to go farther than this, and for
the rest of his life he maintained an attitude of reserve in according
additional favors to the Holy See.Pippin’s reign came to an end as calmly as though the line of descent
had been unbroken. Even the evil traditions of the Frankish monarchy
with respect to the inheritance of the crown were not cast aside. Just
as Cromwell and Napoleon felt the weight of custom in their relations
with the members of their families, when they were arranging to
perpetuate the power of their own creation, so Pippin, the diplomat,
the cautious statesman, could do, or at least did nothing to alter
the bad and impracticable tribal custom of division of patrimony.
This practice caused the downfall of the Merovingian line, and had
started the revolution by which the fortunes of the House of Heristal
had been assured. This is only one of many anomalies which followed
the breaking up of the administration of the Roman Empire, and which
testified to the absence of initiative on the part of the Germanic
peoples when they were called upon to solve problems of government, for
which they had had no preparation. Rulers who did not hesitate to show
their individuality in other ways proved fearful of violating tribal
customs on questions of divisions of property and family precedence.The new line of Frankish rulers had apparently learned nothing from
the vicissitudes of the elder house. At the death of Charles Martel,
the division of the kingdom between his two sons would have certainly
endangered the sovereignty of his family had not the difficulty been
averted by the abdication of Carloman the elder. Yet Pippin, on his
deathbed, had not scrupled to make the same blunder of dividing the
realm between his two sons, Charles and Carloman. Almost immediately
after their father’s death the heirs, apparently mutually suspicious,
separated from each other, and had themselves separately proclaimed
kings by the Frankish nobles, and received anointment at the hands of
the bishops, Charles at Noyon, Carloman at Soissons.The diplomacy of the dead ruler was revealed in the kind of disposal
he made of his realm. It was an equal division only on paper; for the
arrangement of the shares was such that the elder son was left with
such manifest superior advantages as to territory that the younger
brother could not venture to compete with him. As his share Charles
had the part of his father’s kingdom from which the Frankish hosts
derived their chief military strength, viz.: the lands from the Main to
the English Channel. Besides this, he received the western portion of
Aquitaine, the province whose conquest had cost Pippin a hard struggle
of seven years, and which, therefore, might become a dangerous center
of warlike enterprise if it were placed entirely in the hands of the
younger brother. Carloman had as his share the Suabian lands on both
sides of the upper Rhine, and the entire Mediterranean coast from the
Maritime Alps to the frontier of Spain. In addition to this there came
to him the eastern half of the territory adjacent to such towns as
Clermont, Rodez, Albi, and Toulouse.In geographical extent there was but little advantage on the part of
the elder brother, but the territory of the younger from a military
point of view was far inferior. Carloman in case of war would have
against him, under the command of Charles, the whole military power
of the Franks. There was no pretense of friendship between the two
new rulers; it seems they had never been friendly. The reason of the
alienation may have been because the birth of Charles preceded the
formal transfer of the Frankish crown to his father. He was, therefore,
the son of a Mayor of the Palace, while Carloman, though younger, was
son of the King of the Franks.The question of the duration of external harmony between the brothers
was of especial importance in its effect on the situation in the
Italian peninsula. Some of the Frankish nobles had by no means approved
of Pippin’s policy of opposition to the Lombard kings, and had
criticised his willingness to protect the integrity of the dominions of
the Pope, whenever he was appealed to from Rome for aid. The efforts
of the Queen Mother Bertrada were evidently intended to promote a
better feeling between the Franks and the Lombards, for she personally
arranged a marriage between Charles and the daughter of Desiderius, the
Lombard king. The protests of the Pope were unavailing when he urged,
from a decidedly interested point of view, that Charles should marry a
wife from his own people; although he recalled the oaths taken, when
the two Frankish rulers were children, that they would have the same
friends and the same enemies as the Church.The whole situation, political as well as personal, was suddenly
changed by the death of Carloman in 771, and by domestic difficulties
in Charles’ own household which led to an alienation from his mother
and caused the repudiation of his Lombard wife. Immediately after his
brother’s death Charles was acknowledged as sole king throughout the
Frankish territories, and the alliance with the Lombard party in Italy
was brought to an end. Gerberga, Carloman’s widow, and her sons betook
themselves to the court of Desiderius, which now became a natural
refuge for all who were discontented with the new ruler of the Franks.
II CONSOLIDATION OF RULE
In the meantime, Pope Stephen, the man who had made the Frankish
alliance the cornerstone of papal diplomacy, had died. (772.) He was
succeeded by Hadrian, who proclaimed his purpose to follow the rule of
peacemaker in the complexities of Italian politics, and so to induce
Romans, Franks, and Lombards to live in mutual harmony. Despite his
pacific intentions, he was unable to tolerate the military aggression
of the Lombards on the cities in the Patrimony which had been turned
over to the Pope by Pippin, including Ravenna itself.Papal protests against this invasion proved useless. Desiderius
threatened to appear with his army before the walls of Rome itself,
and he actually approached as close to the city as Viterbo, having in
his army the young heirs of Carloman, whose claims to their father’s
inheritance he wished to have legitimatized by having them anointed
by the Pope. He was deterred from carrying out his plan, and the Pope
met the daring of the Lombard leader with a formal warning, that the
king and all his host would be placed under the ban of anathema if they
entered the territory of Rome. Desiderius therefore withdrew.To the Frankish delegates who appeared in Rome to investigate the
condition of affairs between the Pope and Desiderius, Hadrian probably
explained that his difficulties had been occasioned by his refusal to
anoint the pretenders, Carloman’s sons, at Desiderius’ request. There
would not be wanting, also, appeals to Charles to fulfil his solemn
engagements to stand by the Roman See. Desiderius, in his interview
with the envoys, treated them curtly; he was evidently looking forward
to settling the issue with Charles by arms. There was not only the
difference with the Pope, due to Lombard aggression on the papal
cities, but he must have felt aggrieved because Charles had refused to
live with his daughter. There was also the fact that at the court of
the Lombard king, Carloman’s children had been received and were being
used in the rôle of pretenders, as tools in an intrigue against the
ruler of the Franks.Desiderius had prepared for invasion from the North by fortifying the
pass at Susa, the “débouchement” in northwestern Italy of the road
regularly taken by the Frankish army when they invaded Italy. But
while methods of military defense were being looked to, Desiderius
saw the need of preparing for the coming struggle by consolidating
his rule over his adherents and dependents. The important Duchy of
Benevento was allied with him by the bonds of family relationship. The
Duchy of Spoleto was less important, as it had lost in territory and
in independence during the reign of Desiderius, but means were taken
to conciliate the Church by gifts to important abbeys. Indeed, so
numerous were these alienations of the royal lands to ecclesiastical
foundations, that the king’s policy in annexing cities and territories
in the Patrimony of the Pope had become as much an economic as a
political necessity, for the owners of the alienated land could only in
this way be compensated for their losses. The abbeys were of strategic
importance; many of them, and these the largest, were situated on
the inner lines of communication. The cities and castles were still
surrounded with their Roman walls, and under the Lombard monarchy the
many roads and bridges had been kept in order.On the other side of the Alps, there was less unanimity as to the
necessity of the Frankish army passing the frontier. Charles’ plan
of intervention was agreed to by the Frankish nobles, though the
opposition against an Italian expedition had always before in Pippin’s
day had a strong backing. But, in order to show a temper amenable
to compromise, Charles offered to continue peaceful relations with
Desiderius, on condition that the sum of 14,000 solidi be given as an
indemnity to the Franks. This offer was refused. A general assembly of
the Frankish host was held at Geneva by Charles, and after dividing it
into two parts, the army passed over into Italy by Mont Cenis and by
the Great St. Bernard. Again Charles stopped to treat with Desiderius,
but to no purpose.The Lombards withdrew from their strongly fortified position where
the Alpine passes widen out into valleys, and it was rumored that the
Frankish army, aided by Lombard treachery, had found by-paths to avoid
the strongly held Lombard camps and had marched down into the plain
after Charles had stayed some time at Novalese, an abbey richly endowed
by his family, where he took provisions for his march.In the meantime, Desiderius had fled to Pavia, his capital, preparing
for a long siege. Most of his army was now scattered; a portion of it
retreated, accompanying his son Adalghis, with the widow of Carloman
and her children, to Verona, the strongest of the Lombard citadels.
But the Lombard resistance was most ineffective; the Beneventines
apparently took no part in the wars, while the people of the Spoletan
duchy, deserting their duke, took the oath of allegiance to Hadrian,
and many places in central Italy surrendered to the Pope.Charles began the siege of Pavia at the end of September, purposing
by the capture of their chief city to end completely the dominion of
the Lombards, and so to finish the work left half done by his father.
Leaving the bulk of his army in front of the walls of Pavia, he took
a division of Frankish troops and entered Verona without opposition.
Adalghis fled to Constantinople. Carloman’s wife and heirs were now in
the hands of the conquerors.There was no longer fear of opposition from other Lombard towns. The
siege had already lasted six months, but the town was well provided
with food, and was too strong to be taken by assault. Charles now
left the siege with a large escort in order to celebrate the Easter
festival at Rome. He was the first Frankish sovereign who had visited
the city. Pippin, his father, notwithstanding his close alliance with
the Church, had always scrupulously avoided making the pilgrimage
to Rome, probably because he did not desire to pass through Lombard
territories.Charles was received with the honors ordinarily given to the Exarch of
Ravenna. As he entered St. Peter’s, the choir sang the anthem, “Blessed
is He that Cometh in the Name of the Lord,” and there were many public
demonstrations of friendship between the Pope and the King. But it
is worth noting that Charles asked the Pope’s permission to enter
the city, and great care had to be taken to prevent acts of violence
between the residents of the city and the visitors from the North.
The most important step taken before Charles left the city to return
to Pavia, was the formal transfer to the Pope of a document signed by
Charles and his nobles, authorizing the retention by the Pope of the
existing patrimony of the Holy See, and also engaging that all private
property belonging to it should be restored.Pavia held out stoutly, though sorely tried by famine and pestilence;
but there was no hope of relief. Finally, Desiderius surrendered
his capital and his person at the beginning of June, 774, and with
this surrender the independent Lombard monarchy ends. Charles, from
this time forth, took the title of King of the Lombards. The Lombard
chieftains crowded into the city to do him homage, and when he crossed
the Alps, he took with him Desiderius and his family, not forgetting
the royal treasury of the Lombards.Charles had been mindful of his obligations to the Pope, and regarded
himself as bound to carry out the policy of his father. But he plainly
had no thought of turning over any large share of the territory of the
Italian peninsula into the hands of the Roman See. In Rome it seemed
to be expected that the friendly and generous ruler from across the
Alps would make Hadrian master of the whole of middle Italy. But now
that Charles was ruler of the Lombards he showed that in dealing with
the Italian situation he did not intend to be guided by idealistic
politics. Charles also put an interpretation on his title of Patrician
that made it clear he meant to be the predominant factor in the states
under the Pope’s control. He behaved as master in cases affecting the
Pope’s territory when Hadrian’s rights over Ravenna were resisted
by the Archbishop of that city; and he also exercised his sovereign
authority over Spoleto when the Duke rose in revolt against the Franks.
III THE CONQUEST OF THE SAXONS
While Charles’ intervention in Italy may be considered as the logical
outcome of the policy inaugurated by his father, his long struggle with
the pagan Teutonic tribes, spoken of loosely by contemporary historians
as the Saxons, was part of a program of expansion for which he alone
was responsible. Dwelling in a territory extending from the Elbe, on
the East, nearly to the Rhine, on the West, the Saxons in three tribes
formed a primitive confederation occupying the various divisions of
Germany known in modern times as Hanover, Brunswick, Oldenburg, and
Westphalia. Beyond the Elbe there was a fourth section of the Saxon
stock extending over a territory nearly coextensive with the modern
Duchy of Holstein. Though the name suggests a plausible identity,
the Saxon territory of the eighth century had no connection with the
present kingdom of Saxony, which only to a small extent comprises
land that once belonged to these ancient Saxons. Though unlike their
kinsfolk to the West, the Saxons held to their old tribal creed,
they were in no sense savages, for they had long since abandoned a
nomadic life and had become settled tillers of the soil. But probably
the primitive institutions of the Germans described by Tacitus still
existed among them, and, from the point of view of the Franks, they
must have seemed undesirable neighbors, largely because of their
obstinate attitude toward all attempts to convert them to Christianity.
As the missionaries who undertook the task were either Franks
themselves or acted under the patronage and support of Frankish rulers,
the feeling toward the Saxons was anything but friendly, especially
as since the time of the Merovingians on several occasions the Saxons
had recognized the Franks as their overlords, by paying tribute. It is
probable, too, that the Saxons were not very scrupulous in respecting
the frontier of their Western neighbors. There must have been frequent
raids to annoy the Franks, though there is absolutely no proof that the
Saxons ever contemplated invading Frankish territory by expeditions
organized on a large scale. The situation had, however, been serious
enough to call forth active intervention from Charles’s father
Pippin, who, in 753, had advanced as far as the Weser, where, by an
overwhelming display of military strength, he had forced the Saxons to
pay tribute and not to oppose the preaching of Christian missionaries
in their territory.Five years later, in another expedition, Pippin advanced beyond the
Weser, occupying the Saxon strongholds between that river and the
Lippe, and again securing from the Saxon chiefs promises that the terms
on which peace had been made should be carried out.The religious conditions of the peace were especially obnoxious to
the Saxons, who were firmly attached to the faith of their fathers.
They had a simple form of nature worship, that displayed itself in a
passionate reverence for trees and mountains, regarded as the concrete
expression of the powers governing the world. The new expedition of
the Franks practically took the form of a crusade; for Charles saw in
the gods of the Saxons only demons inimical to the Christian faith.
Starting from Worms and accompanied by a large number of ecclesiastics,
who were to war against Saxon paganism, the Frankish army, seemingly,
met not resistance, and Charles took and destroyed without difficulty
the Saxon shrines Irminsul and Eresburg. He withdrew, satisfied
now that there was no hindrance in the way of winning the land to
Christianity. The character of the expedition is accurately indicated
in a brief sentence from the life of Sturm: “He [Charles] gave the
servants of the Lord power for teaching and baptizing.”The Saxons, before the Franks retired beyond the Rhine, renewed
the terms of peace previously concluded with Pippin, gave hostages
for their good behavior, and seemingly made no protest against the
introduction of the Church hierarchical system in their land. But
the war with the Lombards gave the Saxons the opportunity of casting
aside their pledges; they did not desire Frankish ascendancy, and,
still less, Christian missionaries. The real situation on his Eastern
frontier was so patent that as soon as the Italian expedition had
ended with the annihilation of the Lombard kingdom, Charles (775) set
out to war on the Saxons, resolved either to force them to accept
Christianity or to destroy them as a people. His attack was skilfully
and rapidly managed; one of their strong places, Sigiburg, was taken,
and Eresburg, previously captured, was turned into a Frankish citadel.
The Saxons hesitated to strike back until the Franks were withdrawing
across the Weser. Near Brunisberg, where they contested the passage of
the Frankish army, the Saxons were outnumbered and decisively beaten.
Marching with picked troops Charles advanced into the territory of the
Eastphalians, where their leader, Hessi, hastened to take the oath of
fidelity to the Frankish monarch and gave hostages. The same method of
forcing a capitulation was tried successfully with the Saxon tribe, the
Angarians.But meanwhile, the Westphalians had assaulted the Frankish camp in
their land, and had been able to occupy it partially. They were forced,
however, to withdraw, and while they were retreating they were met by
the division of the Frankish army under Charles, and were defeated; so
they were obliged to accept the same terms as the Eastphalians and the
Angarians. Within a short period the overlordship of the Franks had
come to be recognized by the three leading tribes of the Saxon people.It only needed the outbreak of fresh disturbances in Italy to show
how imperfect had been the so-called pacification of the Saxons. When
Charles was drawn away beyond the Alps by an attempt to revive the
Lombard kingdom, his absence was immediately taken advantage of by the
Saxons, who rose in revolt against the Franks. Even the fortress at
Sigiburg was hard pressed. An imposing army was gathered by Charles
at Worms in 776, with which he crossed into Saxon territory and
again occupied Eresburg. His authority was soon restored. Bands of
Saxons comprising whole families came to the Frankish camp as humble
petitioners and willingly allowed themselves to be baptized. There were
evidently two parties among the Saxons, one willing to carry out the
conditions of peace, the other ready by any subterfuge to reject them.
The irreconcilable faction finally lost heart and withdrew.In 777, Charles held in Paderborn his first general assembly; here
appeared Saxons from all parts of the land and solemnly pledged
themselves willingly to give up their freedom and their property if
they denied the Christian faith and broke their oath of allegiance. But
such verbal assurances were not more binding than they had been before.More expeditions (779 and 780) were necessary, and in 780 specific
steps were taken to intensify the ecclesiastical organization already
felt as a burden by the unwilling converts. The land was divided into
parishes, and provision was made for systematic preaching and for the
administration of baptism.Along with the expansion of the Church, the secular organization of the
Franks went hand in hand. The country was placed under the supervision
of counts, the leading Saxon chiefs being appointed to the positions.
In one of the capitularies assigned to this time, the slightest
deviation from Christianity is treated as a most serious crime. The
murder of a deacon is punished by death, while an assault on a count
only entails confiscation of property. Similar severity is exercised
against those who are guilty of sacrilege, who break into churches, or
who violate the rule of fasting.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'There seemed to be a fear at this time lest the popular Saxon leader,
Witikind, who had failed to appear at the assembly, might organize a
pagan revival, and so head a successful revolt against the Franks.
This fear was realized, for the drastic character of the new religious
legislation only provoked the opposition it was designed to meet.
Witikind soon returned to his people and quickly organized a revolt.
The character of the struggle showed itself in attacks on the Christian
missionaries, and in the destruction of the newly erected churches,
the places selected for bishoprics and abbeys suffering most. This
insurrection was for a time successful, and a Frankish army, through
the divided counsels of those who were leading it, was defeated and
forced to retreat. But the personal appearance of Charles on the field
was enough to turn the tide and was followed by the defeat of the
Saxons and by pacification according to the familiar terms.The question was what to do with those who had taken up arms. It was
decided to put to death all who had united with the heathen against
the Christians. This merciless penalty was applied in its fullest
rigor. Those who were taken captive in the revolt numbered in all four
thousand; and of these, five hundred were beheaded at Verden, a savage
act of retaliation which disgraces the memory of Charles, and which
even the crudeness of the times cannot excuse. Besides, it did not
accomplish its purpose, for it only embittered those who were related
by kin or by friendship to the massacred Saxons. The revolt against
the Franks hitherto had never been universal, but now the whole people
rose en masse with sudden determination. Yet even with this temper
they were not hardy enough to take the offensive; so, while they were
preparing to resist, Charles, by a quick movement, surprised them, and
divided their army by his unexpected onslaught. But the first battle,
though unfavorable to the Saxons, was not decisive. The second ended
in a complete victory for the Franks, who took many prisoners and much
booty. The backbone of Saxon resistance was now broken, and Charles
with his army marched through the whole territory as far as the Elbe.In all these Saxon campaigns, three victories stand out above the rest,
dividing the monotonous levels of revolt, conquest, and pacification.
The first, at Brunisberg, opened a way into Saxon territory for the
Frankish army; the second, at Bocholt, brought about the suppression
of a partial insurrectionary movement; the third, on the Hase, settled
the fate of paganism in Germany. But the state of the Saxon country
required constant watching, and we find Charles taking up his station
at Eresburg in 784-85, ready to repress any incipient movement of
revolt.At Paderborn the Frankish assembly was attended by the Saxons, and
this meeting was signalized by further extreme measures to protect
the Church. The defenders of their independence met with all the more
harshness because they were sturdily loyal to a primitive ancestral
faith. Charles saw in them only worshipers of evil spirits,--men who
are charged in the capitularies with the practice of offering human
sacrifices and with eating human flesh. In his ruthless dealings with
the Saxons, Charles was the champion of a higher civilization fighting
against a lower, but one must at least question the legitimacy of his
policy, specifically because it claimed Christian aims and professed
Christian sanction. But we know it seemed righteous in Charles’ own
eyes, and his satisfaction was increased when he received, after
the long military campaigns were over, the Saxon Witikind, and his
companion in arms, Abbio, as voluntary converts to the Christian faith.
With his baptism (785) Witikind drops into obscurity, and we only hear
that his descendants became known for their loyalty to the new religion.From 785 to 792 the Saxons did not stir; they sent regularly their
assigned contingents to the army of the Franks, and they took no part
in the Bavarian troubles. However, at the beginning of the expedition
against the Avars in 793, there was a fresh revolt, marked, as the
previous ones had been, by the destruction of churches, the massacre of
priests, and the return of the people to idolatry. From 794 to 799 the
Franks under Charles were busy each year in enforcing Frankish rule in
Saxon lands by a specially thorough military occupation of the country.Further drastic measures of pacification were required, for whenever
Charles returned West to his own domains, he took with him a large
contingent of the conquered people, men, women, and children. Lands
were given them, and so the natural racial traits of Saxon unity were
destroyed and their fidelity to paganism broken. It is estimated that
a third of the population was removed, and the extent of this enforced
emigration may be judged from the fact that in 804 ten thousand men
were deported from two districts of Saxony and their land given
over to some of Charles’ Slavic allies who had rendered efficient
services to him during these wars against their hereditary enemies.
The Saxons gave up the fight only when their strength was broken, and
when the last adherents of paganism yielded to superior force. Only
then was the country from the Elbe to the Atlantic under the sway of
a single sovereign, and united by the profession of the same faith.
The conquered land was effectively occupied, and the loyalty of the
inhabitants to Charles’ empire was secured by the establishment of
three richly endowed bishoprics, Bremen, Münster, and Paderborn, under
whose supervision the work begun by the Frankish armies was completed.
IV OTHER MILITARY ACHIEVEMENTS
The struggle with the Saxons lasted thirty years in all, and its
completion brings us almost to the end of Charles’ reign. In order to
close our survey of the military operations by which the integrity of
the Carolingian Empire was preserved, or its frontiers enlarged, it is
necessary to take up the narrative of various warlike expeditions and
operations which demanded the ruler’s attention while the Saxons were
making their heroic struggle to cast off the Frankish yoke.Hardly two years after the destruction of the Lombard monarchy, there
was such unrest in the small Duchy of Friuli, which was ruled over
by Hrodgaud, that a punitive expedition was needed to restore order.
Apparently Hrodgaud was intriguing with other Lombard leaders to
procure the restoration of the exiled son of Desiderius and so to
reëstablish Lombard independence. The project failed. Hrodgaud’s allies
among his own people withdrew support. Adalghis, the “pretender,” did
not leave Constantinople to head the revolt, consequently the Duke of
Friuli was obliged single-handed to meet the avenging Frankish army.
The revolted cities were soon captured; Hrodgaud himself appears to
have lost his life on the battlefield, and after this short campaign,
which took place in the early months of 776, Charles crossed the Alps
in June to take up again the conquest of the Saxon lands.This Lombard revolt, although it was an incident, and involved only
a small territory, was followed by stringent measures of repression.
Paul the Deacon, the Lombard historian, tells of the treatment of his
brother, who, it seems, took part in this insurrection. “My brother
languishes a captive in your land, broken-hearted, in nakedness and
want. His unhappy wife, with grieving lips, begs for bread from street
to street. Four children must she support in this humiliating manner,
whom she is scarce able to cover even with rags.”Much more serious than this outbreak among the Lombards was the
disaffection of Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria, who resented Charles’ aim
to turn a nominal suzerainty into an effective control. United closely
to the Frankish ruler by a common descent from Charles Martel, Tassilo,
whose family, the Agilolfings, had governed Bavaria for two hundred
years, had no mind to sacrifice the autonomy of his people. Even under
Pippin he had showed that he placed a very loose interpretation on
the ties of vassalage which bound him to the Franks. After Charles’
accession he continued his policy of isolation, showing by his failure
to render assistance in the campaign against the Lombards that he
did not recognize any obligation to further the ambitious schemes of
his overlord. During the revolt of Friuli he observed an attitude of
neutrality, an act which, coming from a vassal, could signify only that
the Duke of the Bavarians claimed an independent position. Such a claim
Charles was in no mood to allow. In 780, during one of the intervals in
the progress of the Saxon conquest, Charles, accompanied by his wife
and his sons, Carloman and Louis, spent Christmas at Pavia, the Lombard
capital, and in Easter, 781, visited Rome, where the royal children
received baptism at Pope Hadrian’s hands, and were raised by the
ecclesiastical ceremony of anointment to the royal dignity, Carloman
taking the title of King of Italy, and his brother Louis, that of King
of Aquitaine. During this stay at Rome, the relations of Tassilo to the
King of the Franks were discussed by Charles and the Pope. The result
was that a joint deputation was sent from both Charles and Hadrian
to Bavaria to remind its ruler of his obligations as a vassal of the
Frankish kingdom. Tassilo soon after appeared personally at Worms to
renew the oath previously sworn to Pippin. Hostages were exchanged on
both sides, but the tension continued. We find Tassilo, a few years
later, in 787, sending representatives to Rome in order to secure the
Pope as an intermediary to establish an agreement with Charles and put
an end to the mutual irritation of both parties. The terms offered by
the Bavarians were not regarded as acceptable by the representatives of
Charles, and the Pope himself solemnly appealed to the Duke to fulfil
his promises as a dependent ally and so avoid the evils of war.After his return from Italy Charles held his court at Worms and
summoned Tassilo before him as the first step in acknowledging the
overlordship of the Frankish monarch. In the eyes of Charles, swift
dealing with a disobedient vassal was all the more necessary, because
Tassilo, by his marriage with the daughter of Desiderius, might easily
make himself the center of a revival of pro-Lombard feeling in Italy.
Three Frankish armies from different quarters invaded Bavaria, and
Tassilo soon found himself forced by this display of superior strength
to give up his dreams of independent power. He formally resigned his
duchy and received it back again from Charles’ hands, at the same time
taking an oath as vassal and giving hostages, among whom was his own
son. But not long after this Tassilo, who complained openly that his
position of dependence was insupportable, was charged by members of his
people with intriguing with the Avars. He was accused of treachery, and
was condemned to death by legal process. But the sentence was reduced
by Charles’ intervention to imprisonment in a monastery. His wife and
children met a like fate, and from this time on Bavaria was treated
as Frankish territory. Like Saxony, it was divided into jurisdictions
under counts and placed under the supreme military control of one
superior official.The overthrow of Bavaria as a separate power laid the foundation of
a consolidated Germany, North and South, and, as in Middle Germany,
there was the same system of counties and bishoprics. Unity was still
far from being thoroughly realized, but that the germ of national
consciousness was already present is proved by the readiness of the
Bavarians, after the loss of their ruling duke and their autonomy, to
coöperate with the Franks in resisting the attacks of the Avars.Just at the time that the tension in Bavaria was reaching its acute
stage, the situation in the Lombard Duchy of Benevento, whose Duke
Arichis seemed to be taking his cue from Tassilo, demanded attention.
There were no actual hostilities, for the presence of Charles in the
duchy was enough to bring the turbulent Duke to reason. His position
of vassalage was marked by a payment of an annual tribute of 7000
solidi. The duchy was mildly treated by Charles because it was useful
as a buffer against the provinces of the Eastern Empire, with which his
relations were far from being always friendly. The result was that the
Beneventines played a double rôle, sometimes befriending the Greeks
and rejecting the Frank overlordship, and on other occasions engaging
in hostilities with their Southern neighbors, as allies of the Franks.
There were a number of Frankish expeditions necessary to keep the
Lombards of Benevento and their dukes in mind of their duty as a vassal
state, and once there was a noteworthy failure of Frankish arms in 792,
when the campaign they had begun in the territory of the duchy was
abandoned.Apart from the campaigns in Saxony, in Italy, and in Bavaria, necessary
to the integrity of the Frankish empire, there were various frontier
wars undertaken, not for the purpose of incorporating fresh territory,
but rather to impress upon contiguous peoples the power and prestige
of Frankish arms. The occupation of Bavaria brought Charles in contact
with the Avars, and his control of Aquitaine gave him as near neighbors
the Moslems of Spain, those enemies with whom his grandfather, Charles
Martel, had tried conclusions on the historic field of Poictiers.This defeat had been inflicted on the conquerors of Spain at a time
when the Ommayad Caliphate ruled over a united Moslem world. But the
great internal revolution had broken this unity in 750, eighteen years
before the accession of Charles. The last Ommayad Caliph, Merwan, after
the great battle of Mosul, had been obliged to flee from Damascus to
Egypt and had there met his death. Shortly afterward eighty members
of his house were massacred by treachery at a banquet. Only one of
the family escaped, Abderahman, the son of Merwan, who, after many
adventures, reached Morocco, and was there invited to assume the rule
of Moslem Spain, where the jealousies of the Emirs, the lieutenants
of the far-distant Caliph in the East, had produced an era of
misgovernment and faction.So began in 755 the Caliphate of Cordova, and with it the most
brilliant period of Mohammedan rule in Spain. But Abderahman was
not accepted as supreme head of the Spanish Moslems without active
protest; the Eastern Caliphate of the Abbasides had many supporters
in the peninsula, and it was to Charles that they appealed for aid
in resisting the Ommayad house. Naturally, the internal disputes of
the Spanish Moslems constituted by themselves no ground for Frankish
intervention. But the appeal was reinforced by promises that various
Spanish cities would open their gates if Charles would undertake to
cross the Pyrenees with an adequate army. This offer was made to
Charles by Moslem envoys, who appeared before him at Paderborn, where
he was holding a formal assembly (placitum) of the Frankish host
during the early course of the Saxon war. The prospects of valuable
territorial acquisition prompted the ruler of the Franks to embark
on this hazardous expedition. There is no proof whatsoever it was
undertaken to aid, as a kind of crusade, the feeble kingdom of the
Asturias, where the heirs of the Visigoths were still maintaining the
Christian cause against the Moslems.In the spring of 778 the Christian army in force, containing
contingents of Lombards and Bavarians, as well as Franks, crossed the
Pyrenees, part of it passing into what afterwards became the Kingdom
of Navarre, while the second division moved along the Mediterranean
coast. Both were to meet at Saragossa, but before the junction was
made Charles laid siege to Pampeluna, which had previously belonged
to the small Christian kingdom of the Asturias. The city was taken,
and at Saragossa hostages were received to guarantee to the Franks the
possession of certain towns between the Ebro and the Pyrenees. With
this inconclusive result the aggressive part of the campaign ended.
Probably Charles hesitated to penetrate further into the country after
hearing that Abderahman had lately defeated an army of Berbers who had
come over to Spain to help the cause of the Abbaside Caliph. It was
now evident that the prospects of the opponents of the Ommayad house
were anything but brilliant, and it must have seemed advisable for the
Frankish army to withdraw from Spanish territory. Summer had already
begun before Charles turned his face homeward, after leveling the walls
of the city of Pampeluna to the ground to prevent its inhabitants from
revolting against him.It was during this retreat that the famous disaster befell the arms of
Charles, to which literary history has given an importance beyond its
real deserts. On the 15th of August, at Roncesvalles, while the main
army was slowly winding its way among the defiles of the mountains,
the Basques applied to the Franks the guerrilla tactics they had
successfully used against all the invaders of Spain, Roman, Gothic, and
Moslem in turn. They made a sudden attack on the rear guard, and this
division of the Frankish army was utterly cut to pieces. Many of the
closest followers of Charles here met their death, among them Roland,
prefect of the march of Brittany, of whom we know nothing apart from
this brief notice in the contemporary histories, but whose exploits
were celebrated in popular legend, where, under the glamour of poetical
description, he has come to occupy a place as a warrior and hero almost
the equal of Hector.The defeat remained unavenged, for it was realized that the pursuit
of the Basques in their mountain fastnesses was impossible. This
expedition into Spain not only accomplished little in the way of
permanent conquest, but served to provoke the Moslems to successful
reprisals extending over a series of years in the Southern part of
Gaul. The country was harried by the invaders, and towns as important
as Carcassonne and Narbonne were attacked and the country about them
ravaged. Dissensions among the Moslems themselves brought a respite,
and, aided by insurgents against the authority of the Cordovan
Caliphate, the Frankish officers in Aquitaine later on extended the
sphere of Frankish influence far into the Iberian peninsula. Before the
end of Charles’ reign Navarre and Pampeluna were again occupied, and he
could number Barcelona among the cities of his empire.After the conquest of Bavaria, the campaign against the Avars, a people
closely allied to the Huns, was brought about by their threatening
attitude on the Eastern frontier, where they showed such constant
hostility to the peoples of German stock that in his military handling
of the problem Charles had the ready coöperation of the Saxons
themselves. After a preliminary campaign in 791, in which the Franks
advanced as far as the confluence of the Danube and the Raab, the
decisive struggle took place in 795, when the Frankish army, under
Pippin, the son of Charles, taking advantage of dissensions among the
Avars, succeeded in forcing the famous armed camp of the Khan called
the Ring, and returned with an immense amount of booty stored there,
the fruits of many successful raids on Christian towns and monasteries.
In 809 the Avars, hard-pressed by the Slavs, were glad to place
themselves under the Emperor, but their number had been so reduced by
warfare that a contemporary historian speaks of their lands as being
deserted, their treasures confiscated, and their nobility wiped out.Operations against the Slavic tribes were taken up in earnest after the
reduction of the Saxons, though we hear of one marauding expedition
against them as early as 789. In 805 and 806 Slavic territory was
overrun by Frankish armies under the command of the Emperor’s
lieutenants, and two strong outposts were established for purposes of
military observation of their movements. These posts, on the Saale
and on the Elbe, became the nucleus for the development of the German
cities of Halle and Magdeburg.After describing the wars of Charles, Einhard, his contemporary,
gives a summary of the conqueror’s achievements that deserves to be
repeated: “Such are the wars,” he says, “which this most powerful
king waged during forty-seven years. For as many years as these he
reigned in the different parts of the earth with the greatest wisdom
and the greatest success. So the kingdom of the Franks, which he had
received from Pippin, his father, already vast and powerful, nobly
developed as it was by him, was increased nearly twofold in extent.
Before his day this kingdom included only that part of Gaul which lies
between the Loire and the Rhine, the ocean and the sea of the Balearic
Isles, and that portion of Germany occupied by the Franks (who are
called Eastern) whose country lies between Saxony and the Danube, the
Rhine and the Saale, the river which divides the Thuringians from the
Swabians. Besides this, the Alemanni and the Bavarians acknowledged the
overlordship of the Franks. To these possessions Charles added by his
conquests first Aquitaine and Gascony, all the chain of the Pyrenees,
and all the territories as far as the Elbe. Then all that part of Italy
which extends from the valley of Aosta to lower Calabria, where is the
frontier between the Beneventines and the Greeks, in length more than
a million paces; then Saxony, which is a considerable part of Germany,
as long and twice as broad, it seems, as the portion of this country
inhabited by the Franks; then the two Pannonias; Dacia, situated on the
other bank of the Danube; then Istria, Liburnia, and Dalmatia, with
the exception of the coast cities which it pleased him to leave to the
Emperor, because of the friendship and the alliance by which they were
united. Finally, all the barbarous and savage nations situated between
the Rhine and the Vistula, the ocean and the Danube, much alike in
language, different in manners, and in their method of existence, all
of whom he overcame and rendered tributary.”
V THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE
In order to present a general outline of the wars of Charles, we
have been compelled more than once to pass beyond the crucial and
culminating event of his career, his coronation as Emperor at Rome in
the year 800, thirty-two years after he had become King of the Franks.
All of his conquests are closely related with this elevation to a
dignity revered for its venerable traditions, and yet the conquests
alone were not in themselves sufficient to secure such an elevation.
The acquisition of the imperial title was the result of a revolution,
a change of policy, due as much to the intangible forces that move
society as to the concrete details of the career of the Conqueror.
Master of Italy as he was after the downfall of Lombard powers, this
territorial control simply gave Charles the position once held by
another great German prince, Theodoric the Ostrogoth. But Theodoric
was not an orthodox churchman as Charles was. It was, therefore, the
combination of the orthodox religion, which Charles inherited as the
successor of the first Frankish kings, and his sway over the Italian
peninsula which prepared the way for the great event of Christmas Day,
800, when he took his place in the line of rulers marked by the names
of Augustus, Constantine, and Justinian.Although close relations subsisted between the Papal territories
in Italy and the Frankish overlord across the Alps, there was,
nevertheless, in Rome a considerable degree of autonomy. Charles had
no thought of exercising the rights of a sovereign on the basis of
the title of Patrician, which he had inherited from his father, and
on which he had acted when it came to a question of putting an end
finally to Lombard autonomy. But it was only at such crises that the
need of intervention was felt, and, as we have seen in the case of Pope
Stephen, it was the policy of the Holy See to make use of the Frankish
King when questions involving the dignity of the Pope could be settled
in no other way. This policy was maintained by Stephen’s successors,
but it was not easy to induce Charles to undertake to handle thorny
problems which involved the position of the Pope in his own city.
There was no Frankish occupation of Rome, foreshadowing the condition
of affairs there when another Emperor of the Franks protected the
Pope from being overthrown by his unwilling subjects through the use
of French bayonets. Rome, like other Italian cities, was often in a
state of turbulence owing to factional divisions among its citizens.
There was already a beginning of that rivalry among Roman families to
secure the Papal throne to one of its members that so often brought
degradation to the Papacy during the course of the Middle Ages.
Upon the death of Pope Hadrian in 795, after a long pontificate of
twenty-three years, Leo III became his successor, but it seems that
the succession was not altogether satisfactory to the kinsmen of the
dead Pope, for they soon proceeded to extreme measures against his
successor, seizing his person and trying to blind him. Leo, completely
terrorized, seems to have lacked supporters in Rome to defend him, and
he sought refuge with the great King at his camp near Paderborn, in
Saxony, which was being used as a center for the operations against the
recalcitrant Saxon tribes. The matter in dispute between the Pope and
his enemies at home turned out to be a complicated one. Charles, in
his capacity as Patrician, listened to the charges and countercharges
brought by one side against the other. It was evident that justice
could not be done at such long range, and, therefore, the King, after
sending Leo home under the protection of Frankish ambassadors, moved
slowly down into Italy in the year 800.Charles showed no haste to take up the obligation of settling the
differences between the Pope and his discontented subjects. An
expedition into Italy was always costly and troublesome. The situation,
too, on the Eastern frontier needed his attention, because of the
death of Count Gerold and of Erich of Friuli, on whom he depended for
warding off the attacks of the Avars and the Slavs. There were matters
also in the Western part of his dominions which required his personal
supervision. His lieutenants had just won victories over the Bretons
and in the Spanish peninsula. New schemes of expansion had to be
worked out, and provision made for protecting the sea coast. Besides,
he was interested in securing for Eastern Christians dwelling in the
dominions of the Saracens, advantages which they were unable to attain
through the intervention of the rulers at Constantinople. A way had
been opened by the arrival at his court of a monk from Jerusalem, with
presents from the Patriarch and relics from the Holy Places. There are
hints also of his receiving representatives from the Byzantine province
of Sicily, and of direct suggestions from influential quarters in the
East, where the rule of a woman, the Empress Irene, was resented, that
the great Frankish King should assume the imperial title. He turned
his steps towards Rome only when he had made himself familiar with the
special needs of the situation brought about by Leo’s policy. Many of
his intimate advisers, Alcuin, Engelbert, Am of Salzburg, and Paulinus
of Aquileia, had evidently discarded for some time all thought of the
possibility of the Frankish ruler assuming the honors and rights which
the imperial position, to the minds of that age, could alone bestow.
Now everything was changed; the Empire was the one political idea which
was common to the German and to the Italian, and it was kept alive by
the influence of churchmen, to whom the existence of the Empire was the
necessary complement to a Catholic Church. Charles was already acting
with a recognized power fully equivalent to that of an emperor. His
rule was not local like that of other barbarian kings; the title was
needed to complete the political evolution, just as really as it was
necessary for his father, Pippin, to give up the rôle of Mayor of the
Palace and become “de jure” King of the Franks. This point was made
perfectly clear when the general assembly of Charles’ dominions was
held at Mainz in August, 800, and the Italian expedition was announced.In Ravenna a stay of eight days was made by the invading army, and a
detachment was sent off to pacify the Lombard Duchy of Benevento. Not
far from Rome the King was greeted by the Pope, who then returned to
Rome to prepare for the official reception of the ruler, which took
place, on November 24th, with the customary ceremonies appropriate
to the patrician rank of the visitor. Eight days afterwards, Charles
having previously visited the Basilica of St. Peter’s, explained
publicly and officially the purpose of his coming to the city, viz.:
to investigate the charges against the Pope.This was an informal and personal process, for, according to the
ecclesiastical canons, no one could officially judge a cause in
which the Pope was concerned. But Charles’ conception of his duties
as Patrician meant no mere perfunctory examination. For three weeks
there was a public hearing, like an extra-judicial examination before
a referee, of the rumors and charges against Leo’s conduct, a chance
being given to each side to ventilate its grievances. It is significant
that the Frankish King was won over to the view of his leading
ecclesiastics, including Alcuin, that the charges against Leo were
without foundation, and were only the product of personal enmity.The difficulty was to give the decision such a form that, by avoiding a
judicial character, it would not infringe upon the Papal prerogative,
according to which the Bishop of Rome was not responsible to any
earthly tribunal. The bishops themselves explicitly adopted this
position by refusing to pass sentence on the head of the Church. After
this principle had been accepted, the Pope could declare himself
free from guilt. In so doing he was following a precedent set by
his predecessors in like circumstances, Marcellinus, Symmachus, and
Pelagius I.So he proceeded on December 23d to exculpate himself by formally
declaring his innocence before a great assembly of secular and
ecclesiastical dignitaries, expressly mentioning that the proceeding
was voluntary and not required by the canons of the Church. In this way
the immediate cause of the expedition of the Franks was disposed of,
but Charles remained in Rome in order to provide for things needful in
the administration of his Italian dominions.On Christmas Day a multitude had gathered together to celebrate the
festival. As the King rose from prayer at the Confession of St. Peter
the Pope placed the imperial diadem upon his head. The congregation,
acting under one inspiration, joined spontaneously in the acclamation,
used in former days in Rome, and still customary at the time at
Constantinople,--“Life and Victory to Charles the Pius Augustus,
crowned by God, the great and peace-bringing Emperor.”Three times the formula was repeated. After this proclamation the Pope
reverenced the new Emperor, genuflecting, as was the Roman custom, and
probably this act of homage was repeated by all who were present. On
the same day the Emperor’s son, Karl, was anointed King by the Pope,
just as his brothers, Pippin and Louis, had been elevated to the royal
dignity twenty years before. A few days later the Emperor, sitting as
supreme judge, condemned to death the Pope’s accusers, sentences which,
at Leo’s request, were mitigated to deportation.The biographer of Charles represents the ceremony of the coronation
as a surprise, prepared by the Pope without consulting Charles, and
so done not only without his will, but contrary to his desire. The
Emperor, indeed, is reported to have said that, if he had known of the
Pope’s intention, he would not have visited the Basilica. These words
may be interpreted as an expression of the usual formula of humility,
frequent in ecclesiastical elections on the part of the successful
candidate, or else they may mean that the Emperor objected to the way
in which the dignity was bestowed. It will be noted that the act of
placing the crown on his head preceded the acclamation of the people’s
choice. The details of the ceremonial were copied from the one used at
Constantinople, where it had long been the custom for the Emperor to be
crowned by the Patriarch. But, according to the political theory of the
time, the imperial dignity was not conferred by the receiving of the
diadem, but by the election of the Roman people and army, and by the
formal act of homage done at the time. The Pope, by his presence, added
more solemnity to the occasion, but his intervention added nothing in
the way of legal validity to it.Charles’ own point of view is shown plainly enough in the fact that
in 813 he proclaimed his son Louis Emperor and crowned him with his
own hands. As he acted here without requesting the coöperation of the
Pope, a purely lay method of conferring the imperial dignity may have
appealed better to his convictions than that followed in his own case.
But there could have been no improvised procedure in the ceremony at
St. Peter’s. Charles could not have been made Emperor against his will,
nor is it possible to harmonize the details of the ceremony with such
an explanation. How could the coronation have been an impulsive act on
the Pope’s part, taken without the Emperor’s knowledge, when the diadem
was in readiness, and the great congregation were prepared to repeat
without confusion the words of acclamation? Such preparations must
have had the consent of the Frankish ruler, for it is most unlikely
that he should not have known of them. His own objections, therefore,
were probably due to certain features of the ceremony actually carried
out, those, namely, by which the Pope took the initiative. A stricter
following of ancient precedent, at a time when no ceremonial change
should have been introduced by which the legitimacy of the succession
could be questioned, would have approved itself to Charles. An emperor
had to be provided for the West, and scrupulosity in following
precedents was desirable, especially in view of the doubt as to whether
the Empress Irene could, as a woman, legally hold supreme power at
Constantinople.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'It must be remembered that there had been several attempts made in
the seventh and eighth centuries to revive the connection between
Rome and the imperial dignity. But they had failed because there was
no considerable and acknowledged political force behind them. Now,
under the extensive rule of the Frankish King, the elements required
to give an actual validity to the imperial claim were present in an
overwhelming degree. Charles was in control of most of the territory
once belonging to the empire in Western Europe, and along the Eastern
and Southeastern frontiers he had succeeded in extending its limits--a
task unparalleled by the achievements in these same regions of the
greatest of the Roman Emperors. The Teutonic peoples, who centuries
before had made their first appearance as “fœderati,” in the service
of the Empire, were now component parts of it, and had definitely
entered the sphere of Roman civilization. What Athaulf had deemed to be
impossible, what neither Odoacer, Theodoric, nor the Lombard Kings had
tried or dared to do, Charles had done, now that, advancing from the
title of Patrician, which had been held often by the barbarian rulers,
he claimed for the Germans the full right to the imperial name.In its ecclesiastical relations the revived Empire differed from the
old. The Pope had become a factor in the political evolution of the
West in a way unknown to the age of Athaulf, Theodoric, or Odoacer.
Gregory the Great had turned to the East as a subject of the Roman
Empire, to ask aid of his legitimate Emperor; the bishops of Rome,
in the eighth century, as equals, turned to the Franks, and of this
alliance the ceremony of Christmas Day, 800, was the logical sequence.For the Germanic peoples the coronation of Charles did not mean
absorption into a unified system of absolutism, such as prevailed
in the East; but it did mean that the predominant factor in their
future was to be their relation in the logical sense to the Italian
peninsula, and it is just this relationship in its various phases which
was worked out in the Middle Ages, and so it may justly be called the
distinguishing mark of the medieval period.Charles’ assumption of the imperial title did not imply that he ceased
to regard himself as the head of a Germanic people, nor was there
manifest on his part any intention to shift the existing Teutonic
basis of his rule towards a Latin center. For several months after the
coronation ceremony he remained in Italy, but the Alps were recrossed
in the summer of 801, and during the rest of his life he never again
set foot on Italian soil.With the Eastern Empire, which might have been stirred to active
hostility by the introduction of a rival claimant to the imperial
throne, relations continued to be good. Embassies passed from one
court to another, and it is reported by a Greek chronicler that
Charles transmitted officially to the Empress Irene a proposal that
the two empires should be united by their marriage. In 803 the Empress
Irene died, after her deposition had been brought about by a palace
revolution by which Nicephorus, the Grand Treasurer, was placed on
the throne. In 806, for a short time, these peaceful relations were
broken by a contention over the possession of Venice, whose commercial
importance was beginning to be recognized. A Byzantine fleet appeared
off the lagunes, but was unable to prevent the coveted islands from
being taken by Pippin, Charles’ representative in Italy, who brought
the contest to a close in 810 by a combined attack on sea and land. In
812, as a compensation for acknowledging Charles as Roman Emperor, the
Adriatic territories, Venetia, Istria, Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were
restored to Byzantine rule.
VI CLOSING YEARS
The period of conquests and warlike expeditions was almost over.
One hears of the ravages of Scandinavian pirates, and of marauding
incursions by Moorish corsairs along the extended coast line of the
Empire. They seem to have remained unpunished, for Charles gave little
attention to the development of a navy. In the years from 808 to 810
there were operations on a large scale against a threatened Danish
invasion of the Northeastern frontier of the Empire. Some actions of
an indecisive character were fought, and the preparation of a fleet
sufficient to meet the Danish flotilla of two hundred ships was taken
in hand. The prospect, however, of more serious complications was
dissolved by a domestic revolution in Denmark, and for the rest of the
Emperor’s life peace prevailed between himself and the Danes. As time
went on, the actual direction of military operations was left to the
Emperor’s two elder sons, Charles and Pippin, who seem, on the whole,
to have harmoniously worked together in carrying out their father’s
plans.The enforced inactivity of the Emperor brought forward the need of
providing for the future administration of his domains. His eldest son,
another Pippin, of illegitimate birth, was not on the list of those
from whom the future rulers were to be selected. Years before, in 792,
he had been discovered in a plot to dethrone his father, and had been
sent to a monastery.There were now but three heirs to the empire, Louis, in Aquitaine; a
younger Pippin, in Italy, and Charles, in Germany, all intrusted with
important charges by their father. In 806 a formal document was drawn
up regulating the succession. Charles received the countries from
whence the Franks had originated, Austrasia along with Neustria, and
the East Frankish provinces; the younger brothers were to exercise
independent power over the countries they already were administering.
Besides this, Pippin was to take Bavaria, and Louis the Provençal
districts and the largest parts of Burgundy. Charles directed that
his sons should help one another against their enemies, internal
and external; he also arranged the roads by which Italy should be
approached in case of need, and provisions were made at the same time
for securing independence in the fractions of the Empire. Among these
dispositions, perhaps the most significant were that no “beneficium,”
or assignment of lands, should be made in any of the two divisions,
save to individuals who were residents there, and that no man
expatriated for his crimes should be received by the ruler of another
territory. The inner unity of the three realms and their independence
from one another was the master idea of this whole testamentary
arrangement. These provisions were made by the Emperor after he had
advised with his nobles. They seem to have harmonized with his own
sense of justice, and, strangely enough, the ideals of family life
predominated in cases where, beyond all other considerations, political
acumen should have prevailed. The Emperor relied, so far as the unity
of the Empire was concerned, on the loyalty of his sons to his own
counsels and to one another.The plan was soon frustrated by death, for within five years of the
date of his division, Pippin and Charles had both died. The Emperor
was old, and the question of succession was a more pressing one than
ever. It was being discussed with equal interest by friends and foes
alike. It must have been also a matter of the profoundest moment to the
creator of the Empire, to make such dispositions as would, at least
from his own point of view, secure its permanence.At the end of the summer of 813, Charles, following the precedent
of his father and grandfather, drew about him the most important of
his officials, and prepared, with their approval, to provide finally
for the succession. The disposition was comparatively simple, as
only one of the three sons, Louis, who had enjoyed the privilege of
Papal recognition, was still alive. He had succeeded, besides, in
giving a practical demonstration of his capacity by his successful
administration of Aquitaine. Therefore, he seemed entitled to the
largest share of his father’s dominions, the only difficulty being to
determine the claims of Bernard, the legitimate heir of Pippin. It was,
therefore, settled that he should receive Italy, and he was forthwith
recognized as its King.Only one question was now in doubt as to what extent the prerogatives
of the imperial dignity should be passed over to the principal heir.
This, as it was the creation of the Emperor, seemed to be under his
personal control, so he accordingly prepared to make Louis co-Emperor.The determination of the Emperor to advance his son to the imperial
dignity, making him co-ruler with himself, appeared to have been
unanticipated by the assembly. They applauded the design and greeted
it as an illustration of divine direction. There was no longer any
doubt that the central power would continue to exist. Louis was crowned
with the diadem by the Emperor himself, and the act was dissociated
from the precedent which had been followed in Charles’ own case, so
eliminating all question of Papal consent. Rome was not consulted, and
Louis was allowed to return home to his own kingdom of Aquitaine. There
could no longer, however, be any question as to his ultimately becoming
the sole supreme ruler in his father’s stead.Charles may himself, as a political idealist, have believed that in
this transmission he was guaranteeing the permanence of the system
he had built up. But even apart from the unfortunate weakness and
incapacity of his successor, it is doubtful whether personal rule of
this type could have been perpetuated even in the Eastern Empire,
with its crystallized traditions, and where an imperial dynasty, with
recognized prerogatives and absolutism, endured from age to age. Even
in the East there were frequent breaks in the succession.The long reign was clearly drawing to a close. The Emperor’s physical
powers began to fail, and the malady, which proved a fatal one,
appeared in alarming symptoms. The Emperor knew of his condition, and
had disciplined himself with the common forms of devotion for the
approach of death. After a hunting expedition in the autumn of 813 he
returned to Aix and soon after had an attack of fever. His ordinary
remedies, dieting and the mineral waters of the city, failed to bring
relief, and pleurisy set in. Charles died on the morning of the 28th
of January, 814, after having received the communion from the hands of
his arch-chaplain, Hildebold. His body, after embalmment, was enclosed
in an ancient Roman sarcophagus, still existing in Aix, with ornaments
in relief which depict the Rape of Proserpine. Above the entrance of
the vault containing it was placed this inscription: “Here rests the
body of Charles the Great, mighty and orthodox Emperor, who enlarged
nobly the realm of the Franks, and for forty-six years governed it with
success. He died a septuagenarian, in the year of Our Lord 814, in the
7th indiction on the fifth day before the Kalends of February.”People told how marvels had foreshadowed the Emperor’s dissolution,
how for three days sun and moon were darkened, how the sky was filled
by bright, unnatural flashes of light, how the roof of the Basilica
at Aix was struck by a thunderbolt, and how the name of the Emperor,
“Karolus Princeps,” engraved on a golden crown, suspended in the nave
of the building, faded from sight.Later on, it was reported that the body of Charles had not been placed
in a coffin, but that his tomb contained the body of the great ruler
sitting upright on his throne, appearing just as he did in life, vested
in the imperial robes, a diadem on his head, by his side a sword, his
scepter in his hand, reposing with the book of the Gospels on his
knees. Otto III was said to have entered the tomb and found the body
so placed; but this supposed verification of the legend rests on a
mistranslation of the text of an early chronicle.Folklore soon amplified the career of the great ruler. In the medieval
“Gesta,” Charles appears as the brother of the Pope, the represser of
disloyal vassals, a crusader and pilgrim to the Holy Land, a warrior
of enormous stature, able with one stroke of his sword to cut in two
an armed knight on his charger. In other legends he is presented as a
famous wise man, the founder of the University of Paris.The Emperor in person did not resemble the glorified image of him
handed down by legend. There was no beard extending to his waist, nor
did he wear the magnificent imperial vestments, heavy with precious
stones; nor are the other attributes of the imperial dignity seen
in his conventional portraits authentic, such, for example, as the
scepter, the globe surmounted by a cross, the baton terminating in a
knob of incised silver.According to the most credible accounts, the Emperor was tall; as
Einhard puts it, “not more than seven times the length of his foot.”
His neck was short, and he was, to use the expressive but inelegant
epithet of our ancestors, “pot-bellied.” His head was round, with
large, active eyes, a lengthy nose, a large crop of hair, with a
mustache, but no beard. His voice, we are told, seemed rather weak
for such a large frame. Ordinarily, he was dressed after the Frankish
fashion, in a linen shirt and short tunic, to which in winter fur was
added; his legs were encased in leather bands; a blue cloak and a
sword of expensive workmanship completed his out-of-door wardrobe. On
ceremonial occasions he wore a diadem, adorned with precious stones,
and when he was in Rome he conformed to local custom by wearing the
chlamys, a long Roman tunic.Charles was four times married. After his repudiation of the daughter
of Desiderius, his wives were Hildegarde, Fastrada, and Liutgarda. The
offspring of these various marriages were three sons, Charles, Pippin,
and Louis, the children of Hildegarde; and five daughters, Rothruda,
Bertha, Giselda, Theodrada, and Hiltruda. The girls were carefully
trained in the various arts of domestic economy, and we are told, too,
that in addition to skill in preparing stuffs for wearing apparel, they
showed great interest in collecting for purposes of self-adornment
“gold ornaments and many precious stones.” These unusual maidens proved
such valuable adjuncts to the household that their father refused to
permit them to marry, with the result that three became abbesses, while
two contracted irregular alliances. Rothruda secretly married Count
Rovigo, and Bertha, the poet, Angilbert.Life at court was anything but austere; even the Emperor himself
could not be accused of being overscrupulous in his morals, for after
the death of Liutgarda, in 800, he contracted several irregular
alliances. Charles was fond of traveling; undoubtedly economic and
political reasons may account for the number of royal residences.
But his favorite seat was at Aix, which attracted him on account
of its mineral springs. Here, in a cluster of buildings, secular
and ecclesiastical, of his own creation, he was able to gratify
his own tastes in amusements, which were swimming and hunting. He
was fond of festivities, and liked to live surrounded by his large
family, who helped him to enjoy the good cheer of his table and
entered sympathetically into the natural atmosphere of a court
which was without stiff convention, and which preserved in its naïve
unconstrainedness the tastes of a great Teutonic tribal chieftain. But,
while the wines, the abundant amount of solid food and numerous dishes
of pastry, were well appreciated, there was serious conversation,
and an opportunity was given to the “littérateurs” of the court to
show their skill in verse or repartee. The Emperor himself reverenced
learning, but his own education was anything but advanced, even for
his own day. His intellectual interests were varied, theological
speculation being especially attractive to him. He was fond of singing,
and he spoke easily, clearly, and with an abundant diction. He knew
Latin, and understood, too, a little Greek. When he was of adult age he
studied rhetoric, logic, and astronomy. He liked to have the ancient
historians read to him when he was at table, but his favorite book
was St. Augustine’s “City of God.” Affable and easily approached, his
guests found him personally interested in their affairs; he had a happy
way of saying the right thing at the right time, but he was fully
conscious that his position as Roman Emperor made him a successor of
the Cæsars, and he never forgot that the religious consecration of the
Church placed him, in a mystic sense, in the sacred line of David and
of Solomon.
VII THE CONSTITUTION OF THE EMPIRE
Though we speak of an empire founded by Charles the Great, the use
of the word should not be allowed to lead us astray into comparisons
or analogies based on merely verbal resemblances. Charles was not an
emperor of the type known to the Roman Empire of the classic Christian
period, nor as a ruler can he be compared with Russian Czars or
Napoleon the First. Neither as king nor as emperor was Charles an
absolute monarch. Both before and after the assumption of the more
exalted title, the association of personal rule with the leadership of
the armed host of the Frankish nation was so close and intimate that
the ruler was not to be separated from the source of his authority. The
house of the Karlings could not claim the kind of sanction given to the
Merovingian princes, who were the hereditary rulers of the Franks.When the power of the tribal kingship was broken, the Carolingian
house took first the leadership of the armed Frankish host, and then
the title of King; but they did so through, and with the consent of,
the nation of the Franks. The Karlings were not true successors of the
Merovingians. Their royal dignity had quite a different character; it
did not rest on birth and custom, or the traditional reverence which
comes from ancient and long recognized rights of succession. The army
of the Franks gave the directorship over their nation to the father
and grandfather of Charles, but the source of this authority remained
with and through the army. The leader of the Franks, whether called
king or emperor, ruled his own people, and the territory he gained,
by the consent of the army of the Franks. Charles Martel divided his
territories at his death, but he asked the army’s consent, and when
Pippin was crowned by the Pope, the act was again ratified by the army.In the early years of Charles’ own reign, it was the wish of the Franks
that they should be guided by one ruler, not by two, and in all but
one of the conquests of Charles, the principle that some portion at
least of the annexed nation should ask him to be their overlord was
accepted. Even in the case of the Saxons, where the resistance to the
Franks was universal and unanimous, the purpose of Charles was not a
personal conquest of a people to be governed afterwards as dependents
under an absolute ruler. Rather, as Einhard expresses it, “that united
with the Franks they might along with them be made one people.” This
declaration in itself explains the character of the empire founded by
Charles. The closest analogy to it is to be found in the Ostrogothic
kingdom of Theodoric; the difference being that Theodoric sought for
allies among the independent tribal Germanic kingdoms, while the aim of
Charles meant absorption of these kingdoms under the one ruling race of
the Franks.This principle is perfectly illustrated in the treatment of the Saxons
after their conquest; the moment they accepted the rule of the Franks
they were admitted on an equality with the Franks into the regular
meetings of the armed host of the Frankish nation, and along with their
conquerors took part in its legislative work. These primitive popular
assemblies had originated as the Merovingian dynasty was drawing to
its close, when it was realized that the people must provide for their
own concerns because of the failure of the ruling house to govern
efficiently or successfully. They were held generally in May at a royal
villa or palace in the Rhine Valley, Aix, Worms, or Mainz. In theory
every Frank was supposed to be present. Actually, only the great lords
and the high ecclesiastics were at hand, and their followers stood for
the people.Only the most important personages were admitted to the deliberations.
The laymen present were separated from the clergy, but sometimes the
two orders sat together and went over in detail the measures prepared
for them beforehand. Sometimes this process lasted several days.
These informal sessions were visited by the Emperor, who passed among
those present, talking familiarly to them, and asking questions as to
the happenings and needs of the neighborhoods from whence they came.
Outside the building were gathered a crowd of followers and retainers.The Emperor, after taking the advice of his chief subjects, made his
decisions, and the result was communicated to the people for their
consent. This last act had become apparently a simple matter of form.
The question submitted to the assembly had been prepared long in
advance either by the immediate council at the palace, or by the autumn
assembly, a body organized by Charles himself, which, when the matter
was urgent, decided on questions of peace and war.While nothing is known of the character of the deliberations of this
smaller body, it is clear that measures, already settled by them, were
brought before the May assembly, and so presented that the decisions
taken earlier could be guessed. There were various names given to this
larger body or general assembly, according to the character of the
business that came before it,--conventus, placitum, synodus,--whether
judicial, legislative, or ecclesiastic. It was a council of war and an
executive cabinet; it was also a court of highest instance, a ministry
of foreign affairs and of public worship.At the assembly the members, great and small, made their fiscal
contributions to the prince. The same vagueness, indicative of a crude
and undeveloped stage of government, is seen in the legislative acts
of the assembly, which appeared in the shape of what are technically
called “capitularies.” Analyzing them from the modern point of view,
Guizot reckoned that there were of criminal or civil legislation, 273
items; of moral and religious, 172, and that of these, one hundred
dealt with matters of canon law. The only distinction made by Charles
himself in the capitularies was that some were new measures and were
to be added to legislation already accepted, while others were to be
used for the guidance of the higher imperial officials. The first class
was valid only for the duration of the reign of the sovereign under
whom they were passed. The last, for a year, but the additions to laws
already existing had no time limitation.These capitularies were not intended to supersede national or tribal
custom and law. Each man was judged according to the laws of his own
people, and in 802 the Emperor directed that the unwritten laws of the
peoples under his rule should be collected. The capitularies were,
therefore, supplemental and corrective to the national codes. For
example, one of them, which, by the way, met such strong opposition
that the Emperor was obliged to yield the point, was intended to remove
the abuse of private vengeance.Local administration was in the hands of the counts, and, as in the
Merovingian period, the administrative unit was the county. Altogether
throughout the whole Empire, there were three hundred counts; the
districts which they administered varied in size, the authority
exercised by them being judicial, military, and financial. Along with
the count and closely associated with him is the bishop. As there was
in the capitularies so much which concerned the sphere of the Church,
the coöperation, in their official publication, of the bishop with the
count was not unnatural. Moreover, in the Empire, in addition to purely
religious duties, the bishop had the function of investigating certain
categories of crime, homicides, incest, etc., and in a general way, he
acted as adviser of the count.Among the count’s duties was that of defending the Church and, in
trials for ecclesiastical offenses, he had to be present informally as
assessor. The coöperation of the civil and ecclesiastical authorities
strongly appealed to the Emperor, with his ideals of a Christian
commonwealth; but in experience, the association of the bishop and
the count, as local administrators, worked far from smoothly. So a
capitulary of 801 mentions the Emperor’s purpose to find out the
reasons why bishops and abbots, on the one hand, and counts, on the
other, are not able to assist one another.The problem of defining the limits of the secular and religious spheres
gave rise to constant difficulties, and the situation was further
aggravated by the fact that in many cases the counts seemed inefficient
and venal. They had to be warned not to hang offenders without trial,
to be sober when they were sitting in judgment, not to receive
presents, not to oppress freemen, not to usurp the right which belonged
to the state, not to take the goods of the poor. Once a year the counts
were summoned to the royal palace, and they were required to remain
there long enough to lay before the Emperor a detailed record of their
administration.A special power of review over the counts was given to the “missi,”--a
class of officials existing under the Merovingian Kings, but with
power extended and regularized by Charles, especially after 802.
The whole Empire was divided into “missatica”--the divisions under
a “missus,” which included several counties. For example, Western
France made three of these divisions with centers at Paris, Rouen, and
Orléans. The “missi,” who were generally a count and a cleric, an abbot
or bishop, made a general visitation of their district for a period
lasting over a year, according to a fixed itinerary. They were expected
to see that the royal authority was respected, by exacting a detailed
oath of fidelity from all the inhabitants, and to take care that no one
occupied the royal domain of forest or appropriated the royal revenue.
They looked after the application of the directions contained in the
capitularies, noted the general condition of law and order, saw that
justice was done, and the rules of military service strictly carried
out.Much stress was laid on their judicial functions; when they arrived in
a town they set up their court in the public place; the local bishop
and count had to be in attendance, while the “missi” heard complaints
and altered whatever judgments of the local officers seemed contrary to
right and equity.The “missi,” as we have seen, were selected from the higher clergy and
from the great landlords. Their persons were held to be inviolate and
sacred; all the lower officials of the Empire were ordered to receive
them with respect and give them ready help, and to attack them was a
capital offense.Theodulf, bishop of Orleans, one of the clergy performing the
functions of a “missus,” has left us an account of an official journey
made by him to the South of France. He took boat on the Rhône with
his companion, Leidrade, the archbishop of Lyons, and their work
of inspection began at Avignon. They held their assizes at Nîmes,
Maguelonne, Cette, Agde, Béziers, Narbonne, Carcassonne, le Razès,
Arles, Marseilles, Aix, Cavaillon. The clergy and people hastened to
take advantage of their presence, but Theodulf tells us they did so
with no worthy motive, for they were prepared to buy their favor,
each according to his means. The rich offered good coin, precious
stones, valuable stuffs, and oriental carpets, arms, horses, ancient
vases “of pure metal unbelievably heavy, on which a skilful graver had
represented the fight of Hercules with the giant Cacus.” The poorer
citizens were ready to give red and white skins of Cordova, excellent
fabrics of linen or wool, chests, and wax.“Such was the engine of war with which they hoped to make a breach in
the wall of my soul,” the bishop says, intimating that they had learned
the way by past experience. The custom of giving presents to officials
was so firmly established that even the reforming bishop hesitated to
interfere with it. Accordingly, in order not to offend the suitors,
he felt constrained to accept articles of small value, such as eggs,
bread, wine, tender chickens, and birds, “whose body is small but good
to eat.”Little change was made in the ordinary forms of the Frankish judicial
system by Charles; the count still continued to hold his tribunal as
in Merovingian times, the freedmen of the county were expected to
be present as assessors, but owing to the difficulty of securing an
intelligent tribunal in this haphazard way, Charles instituted a chosen
class of assessors called “scabini,” who were to be taken from the
class of “well-born, prudent, and God-fearing men.” This body was both
the judge and jury, as the count only acted as their presiding officer
and pronounced the sentence formulated by them. From the verdict of
this tribunal there was an appeal either to the King or to the judgment
of God, the favorite form of which at this time was the test by the
cross. In this test, the defendant, holding his arms in the form of a
cross, had to stand upright without changing his position, while the
clergy recited certain prayers. If any movement was made, it was taken
as a sign of guilt.In the palace the King himself often acted in the capacity of judge in
the first instance, and he also heard appeals either in person or by
proxy through the count of the palace. Considerable care was taken that
the right of appeal should not be used indiscriminately. The palace
officials had important governmental as well as personal functions;
their general collective title was the “palatins.” There was no Mayor
of the Palace, the first place being held by the count, who, as has
just been noted, had judicial duties. The administration of the palace
was also in his hands. The religious services of the household were
directed by the arch-chaplain; then came the chamberlains, treasurers,
seneschals, butlers, constables, and the master of domestic functions.
Counts of the palace are found in the command of armies; one of them
being killed by the side of Roland at Roncesvalles, another in Saxony.
Seneschals had charge of the kitchens, but they are also mentioned
as valiant warriors. Butlers were also diplomatists, and we find a
constable fighting the Slavs on the Elbe.A real effort at division of labor is to be found solely in what might
be called, with some elasticity of phrase, the Record Office, where
notaries prepared the King’s letters, charters, and acts of immunity.
At their head was an ecclesiastic, the protonotary, or chancellor. He
was a dependent of the arch-chaplain, and did not have charge of the
seal, yet his position was especially confidential, as he kept the
archives.The King consulted the court officials, who, according to his pleasure,
were gathered about him in an informal way whenever he saw fit to call
them. But, besides this, we are told that Charles had always with him
three of his counselors, chosen among the wisest and most eminent about
him; without their advice he did nothing. To the royal household there
were regularly attached a number of young men, the “discipuli,” sent
there to be educated, and the “comites,” or personal retainers of the
King, a continuation of a custom mentioned by Tacitus.
VIII CAROLINGIAN CULTURE
The Emperor’s solicitude in promoting learning has caused his reign to
be spoken of as the Carolingian Renaissance. But Charles’ intellectual
interests were not those of a fifteenth century humanist. He desired
the revival of letters because he saw in learning a means by which
the Church, which, to his mind, was the organization of the state
Christianized, might overcome pagan survivals, and take the lead in
civilizing the various nationalities in his realm. The clergy and the
monks were ignorant--they could neither preach nor teach. The Emperor
planned a kind of Christian Athens, a new community of scholars, in
which learning was to be the handmaid of religion. After he had assumed
the title of Emperor, he recalled how closely the glory of letters was
associated with the renown of the Roman world, and he desired his own
reign to be signalized by the same elements of culture.The point of view of this intellectual revival is indicated in the
following letter addressed by Charles to Baugulf, Abbot of Fulda.
“Know,” he says, “that in recent years, since many monasteries were
in the habit of writing us to let us know that their members were
offering prayers for us, we noticed that in most of these writings
the sentiments were good, and the composition bad. For what a pious
devotion within was faithfully inspiring, an untrained tongue was
incapable of explaining outwardly because of the inadequacy of
scholarship. So we commenced to fear that, as the knowledge of style
was weak, the understanding of the Holy Scriptures was less than it
should be; we all know that if verbal errors are dangerous, mistakes
in sense are much worse. For this reason we exhort you not only not to
neglect the study of letters, but to cultivate them with a humility
agreeable to God, in order that you may the more easily or the more
justly fathom the mysteries of the divine writings. As there are in
the sacred books figures, tropes, and other like things, there is no
doubt that in reading them each one attains to the spiritual sense
of them the more quickly, in proportion as he has received before
a complete literary training.... Do not forget to send copies of
this letter to all of those with you who are bishops, and to all the
monasteries, if you wish to enjoy our favors.”It was not enough to rely on those already set in authority--they
had to be placed under supervision themselves. Charles saw, as he
expressed it, that he had to find men who had the will and the ability
to learn, and the desire to teach others. Such leaders were selected
from all nationalities, Anglo-Saxons, Irishmen, Scots, Lombards, Goths,
Bavarians. The first to be attracted by the King’s inducements of good
pay and an honorable position were the grammarians, Peter of Pisa, and
Paulinus, and Paul the Deacon, the poet and historian. But in influence
all these were second to Alcuin, a native of England. Born in 735, he
entered the School of York when Egbert, one of the disciples of Bede,
was archbishop. Alcuin under his master Albert acquired the kind of
encyclopedic knowledge that is handed down to us in the volumes of
Isidore and Bede, the chief stress being laid on the Holy Scriptures,
helped out by jejune rhetorical exercises, and scraps of physical
science. He had read Latin literature, knew Greek, and was familiar
with the great writers of Christian antiquity. The King was glad to
secure such a prize, and the two became close friends. Alcuin acted as
confidential adviser to the King, and was one of those who arranged for
the coronation in 800.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'There is a considerable body of literary work from Alcuin’s pen, but
nothing he wrote shows any originality. He was little more than a
faithful transmitter of the learning he received. He set the seal on
the traditional division of knowledge in its seven stages, or, as it
was technically known, the seven arts: grammar, rhetoric, dialectic,
arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. His literary interests may
be judged from the following dialogue: “What is writing?” said Pippin,
one of the Emperor’s sons. “The guardian of history,” replied Alcuin.
“What is speech?” “The treason of thought.” “What engenders speech?”
“The tongue.” “What is the tongue?” “The flail of the air.” “What is
the air?” “The guardian of life.” “What is life?” “The joy of the
happy, the pain of the wretched, the expectation of death.” “What is
man?” “The slave of death, the guest of a place, a passing traveler.”These preciosities give one a depressing idea of Alcuin’s ability. Yet
it must be remembered that they were marvels to the obtuse and crudely
trained minds of men whose chief occupation was war and the chase, and
as an intellectual stimulus they were just as effective as are to-day
the eagerly scanned columns of modern journalism.Alcuin was made royal director of studies; he was schoolmaster of the
palace, and from this circle of the King’s friends originated the
Palatine Academy, the members of which, in order to mark their efforts
at imitating classic culture, adopted fancifully the names of ancient
worthies. So Charles was called David, Alcuin was called Horatius
Flaccus, and Angilbert, Homer. In order to extend their influence
Charles promoted several of the members of the Academy to important
positions in the Church, making them bishops or abbots.The royal plans for promoting learning are indicated in a capitulary
of March 23, 789. “Let,” he says, “the ministers of God draw about
them not only young people of servile condition, but the sons of
freemen. Let there be reading schools for the children. Let the psalms,
musical notation, singing, arithmetic, and grammar be taught in all
the monasteries and all the bishoprics.” These directions led to the
creation of numerous monastic and episcopal schools, all ordered
“according to the customs of the palace.” Alcuin, in 796, withdrew to
Tours, becoming the abbot of St. Martin’s there, and planned to found a
replica of the Saxon school at York, where he had himself been trained.The success of the new educational policy owed much to Theodulph, a
Spaniard of Gothic birth, who, in becoming bishop of Orleans about
798, proceeded to see that his clergy were industrious in reading and
preaching. Schools were opened in town and country where children were
educated without payment, though the parents were expected, if they
were able, to make some return proportionate to their means. From a
document written by another Carolingian bishop, it appears that parents
were urged to send their children and allow them to remain at school
until they were really instructed. In such provisions, it is possible
to find a sketch for primary instruction, though it is not known how
successfully or how widely it was developed.Supplementing these lower schools were others of a higher grade
founded in the more populous centers. In the episcopal and monastic
schools there were accessible collections of books. Charles himself
had a library attached to the palace. The size of some of these
collections may be estimated from the fact that one monastery, St.
Riquier owned two hundred and fifty-six manuscripts. We know, too, that
abbots were accustomed in their election to give presents of books to
their monasteries. In the lists of these donations, which have been
preserved, are to be found chiefly Christian writers, St. Augustine
being an especial favorite; some of the poets of antiquity also find
a place, generally Virgil. The atmosphere of this revival of letters
was predominantly Christian. There are extant, for example, numerous
commentaries on the Gospels of this age, but they are of slight value,
being mere transcriptions of previous authorities.More successful was the new régime in the mechanical work of preparing
better texts. One of the capitularies directs special care to be given
in selecting copyists equal to their task. Both Alcuin and Theodulph
were engaged in preparing a revised version of the Latin Bible, the
latter scholar, with more discretion, using as his model the text
prepared by the famous prime minister of Theodoric, Cassiodorus, after
he had returned to his monastery in Calabria.The historical literature of the period also shows the influence of
this religious “Renaissance.” Hagiographical works were popular, but
in general critical ability was wanting in them. But some advance was
made, for although the traditional lines of narrative are preserved,
more biographical details are given and the style is improved. This
type of Carolingian literature can best be studied in Eigil’s life of
Sturm, in the biographies of Gregory of Utrecht, by Liudger, and in
Alcuin’s “Life of Willibrord.” Some of the annals compiled at this time
follow preëxisting models, while others show a distinct improvement,
especially the “Royal Annals,” which were compiled under the influence
of the royal “littérateurs.” The most noteworthy of this type are the
annals of Lorsch, which follow the course of contemporary history down
to the year 829; they have been assigned without sufficient reason
to Einhard, since it is known that works of a similar character, the
“Gesta,” of the bishops of Metz, were composed by Paul the Deacon.The greatest monument of the literary revival is Einhard’s “Life of
Charles.” Its author, who had studied at Fulda, and become a member of
the court circle sometime between 791 and 796, was a favorite of the
Emperor, and received as a gift several abbeys. Suetonius was taken
as a model by Einhard, but was not slavishly followed. He oftentimes
changes the phrases of his original, and, copyist as he is, he leaves
on the reader the impression of freshness and vigor. Allowing himself
to be guided by his original, he sets down much information which the
ordinary medieval biographer leaves unmentioned.Many letters of this time have been preserved, among the most
interesting being the correspondence of Alcuin. Poetry was widely read,
and all sorts of subjects were treated in verse. Especial attention
was given to metrical inscriptions intended to be placed over the
doors of churches or private houses, on walls, altars, tombs, and in
books. The acrostic form was extremely popular and applied with great
ingenuity. For the more serious poetic efforts, the most popular models
were the Christian poets, Prudentius and Fortunatus. But pagan authors
were by no means neglected, for Ovid, Virgil, Martial, Horace, Lucan,
and Propertius all found imitators. Attempts were made to revive epic
poetry, some of the writers, as in the case of Hugelbert, by no means
doing discredit to their classical models.While Latin was the official language, Charles did all he could to
encourage his native Teutonic speech; he made collections of the
folklore poetry of his own people, directed the preparation of a
“Frank” grammar, and tried to introduce the custom of using the
Teutonic names for the months of the year and winds. But throughout the
greater part of Gaul the “Romance” tongue predominated, though educated
people did not care to employ it. Charles’ biographer tells us that
the Emperor spoke it along with Frankish and Latin. At the Council
of Tours, in 813, the bishops decided that the homilies should be
translated into Romance in order to be understood by the congregation.Warlike songs in the vernacular, celebrating the exploits of the
Franks, are mentioned. The great deeds of the Emperor himself had this
popular recognition, especially the expedition into Spain and the
wars of the Saxons, which excited the popular fancy. That the actual
combatants were accustomed to recount, in verse, both Frankish and
Romance, the events they themselves had witnessed, is known from the
case of Adalbert, a veteran of the wars with the Avars and the Slavs,
whose narrative was taken down by a monk of St. Gall, and transcribed
into Latin.Carolingian art, like Carolingian literature, was pre-eminently
religious. The revival of art was to a great extent a restoration,
i.e., an attempt to keep already existing church buildings from falling
into ruin. This process of destruction was due to the avarice and
carelessness of the generations immediately preceding the founding of
the Empire. New churches were also constructed, the work of building
being laid on the various communities and superintended by the bishops
and the counts. The Emperor’s minister of public works was Einhard,
to whom have been attributed, without sufficient ground, however,
some of the greatest monuments of the period, the bridges at Mainz,
the palace and church at Aix, and the palace at Ingelheim. Though
the monuments of Carolingian architecture were scattered over a wide
extent of territory, Germany, Gaul, and Lombardy, few have survived.
Wood was used for both basilicas and country churches, especially in
the Northern parts of the Empire, and such buildings were naturally
not durable. Where stone was employed, restoration has so altered the
original construction that few examples of the architecture of this
period can be identified with certainty. The basilica type of church,
usual in Merovingian France, was retained, but more attention was given
to the technique of ancient art. Einhard, we know, read Vitruvius. An
original feature of the Carolingian age was the lantern tower, square
or cylindrical, erected at the transept crossing, and surmounted by a
cupola containing the church bells.Byzantine architecture was much admired in court circles, and the
desire to imitate the earlier periods of Græco-Roman art led to
a systematic plundering of the ancient buildings in the Italian
peninsula, from which all sorts of architectural fragments, great and
small, were carried across the Alps, to be incorporated, generally
without much sense of proportion or fitness, in the newly constructed
edifices. The most interesting example of this revived Byzantine
architecture is the Emperor’s own chapel at Aix, which still serves
as a nave in the existing church. Workmen from all quarters of the
civilized world were sent for to engage in its construction; marbles,
sculpture, and mosaics were brought from Italy, chiefly from Ravenna.
Eighteen years elapsed before the church was completed, and it was
consecrated with imposing ceremonial by Leo III, on January 1, 805. It
is a copy of the well-known church of St. Vitalis in Ravenna. Around
an octagonal center, which measures fourteen and a half meters, there
are galleries in two stories, to which access is given by turrets
containing winding staircases. The Emperor’s contemporaries were not
conscious of the mistakes in the execution of this copy of a famous
Byzantine model, and the chapel of Aix was spoken of by Einhard as
admirable and of supreme beauty. It was followed by others in the same
style, one of which, at Germain-des-Près, still preserves, despite
restoration, distinct traces of the original design.The age was remarkable, also, for the extension and building of
monastic foundations. These buildings, as compared with the later
monastic structures, followed a simple plan, with the church edifice
forming the center of the complex. Around the square cloister were
placed the common room, the school, the library, the refectory, and
the dormitory. Near by were the abbot’s home, the guest chamber, and
the infirmary. An idea of the extent of these buildings may be had
from the dimensions of a well-known French abbey, St. Wandrile, where
the refectory and the dormitory measure 208 feet long by 27 feet wide.
As to secular architecture, it is represented solely by the imperial
palaces at Nymwegen, Ingelheim, and Aix.The palace at Aix, like the church, has for its model a building at
Ravenna, the so-called palace of Theodoric. As all of the dependents
of the court had to be accommodated, the ground floor covered a
considerable space. In the center were the apartments of the imperial
family, the audience chamber, the baths. In a large wing of the
building, connecting it with the chapel, there was room for the school,
the library, the archives. In interior decoration stucco, mosaic
work, and mural painting were used rather than sculpture, in which
art Carolingian workers showed little skill. The Emperor, though he
prohibited the worship of images, expressly directed the use in church
of mural paintings, with subjects taken from the Scriptures. In the
palaces the same art was used to illustrate the secular history of the
Empire.The Emperor’s deeds were depicted on the walls and explained in
poetical inscriptions. Mosaic was used for floors and wall spaces, and
red and green porphyry were especially sought after for the decorative
designs that often covered the interior of the cupola, as at Aix, where
the Christ is represented on a gold background covered with red stars,
blessing twelve aged men at his feet, and accompanied by two angels.Work in the precious metals and in ivory was frequent in the churches,
since each had a treasury, and a third of the income, saved from
tithes, was assigned for religious ornaments. In these collections gold
reliquaries with chased work and precious stones were specially valued;
also portable altars and ciboria. The “ivories,” of which interesting
specimens are still preserved, are remarkable for the care displayed in
continuing the traditions of this branch of Christian art, as practised
both in the Eastern Empire and in Italy during earlier centuries.Books are recorded also in the inventories of the church treasuries,
and the specimens that have survived attest the artistic value of
Carolingian calligraphy. The style of writing, under the influence
of English and Irish models, is clear and free from abbreviations.
Besides the miniatures, these manuscripts exhibit artistically drawn
letters, effectively combined, and characters done in gold and silver
on a purple background. There were a number of schools where the art
of copying was taught, the most celebrated being at Tours, under the
supervision of Alcuin. The national library at Paris has a beautiful
example of this work in a book of the Gospels prepared for Charles in
781, by the monk Godescalk. In Vienna, in the imperial treasury, there
is another Gospel book in similar style, which, legend says, was found
on the knees of the Emperor when his tomb was opened.In church music, the Emperor continued his father’s policy of
encouraging the Roman use of singing the psalter, as opposed to the
Gallic custom. Masters were brought from Rome for this purpose and
schools established at St. Gall and at Metz. There is still in the
first-named place a Gregorian antiphonary, brought at this time from
Italy, for the purpose of giving musical instruction after the Roman
method.
IX ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
Turning now to questions of economic development, one is impressed by
the small part played by city life in the Empire, and by the industrial
importance of the manor. The landed proprietor depended on his country
seat for his support in the most real sense of the word. We find
Einhard, while residing at the court at Aix, bidding his tenants send
him flour, malt, wine, cheese, and other products, and he orders 360
bricks to be made in the country. Even the workmen, who are engaged
in building work in the town, are to be sent from the “villa.” Small
estates had completely disappeared and agricultural communities were
the exception. The villas were often placed near together, a tendency
which led to the multiplication of country churches, whose existence
up to this time is only infrequently mentioned in legal documents. It
was this evolution from a union of “villas,” or the country seats on
great estates, which led to the creation of the villages. The growth
of large estates may have been due to the impoverishment of the small
landed proprietor, but other important factors in the change were
the wide extent of frontier land and the growing importance of the
monasteries. The monastic estates were of imposing size, as it was the
custom for the small land owners to cede their property to the monastic
communities, sometimes to escape taxation, but also from motives of
ecclesiastical loyalty to those whom they looked up to as models of
Christian virtue, and whose prayers they coveted as efficacious in
healing all spiritual distress.The importance of these institutions is revealed in the figures given
for St. Wandrile, which had on its rolls 1727 manses, inhabited by a
population numbering 10,000 souls. Luxeuil had 15,000 manses, and
Alcuin, the abbot of St. Martin at Tours, is reported to have had on
his domain no less than 20,000 serfs.The celebrated Polypticon of Irminion, the abbot of St.
Germain-des-Près, drawn up between 800 and 826, records the
administration of one of these great monastic estates. The acreage
belonging to the abbey was 26,613 hectares, and was spread over seven
existing French departments. The parcels of ground numbered 1646; over
10,000 persons were employed, among them only eight freedmen, the rest
being either serfs or “coloni.”Of the land, about two-thirds was arable and one-third wooded. The dues
from the tenants were collected in money, cattle, poultry, wine, wheat,
pitch, linen, mustard, woolen stuff, and thread, honey, wax, oil, and
soap, instruments of wood and iron, firewood, torches. The annual
revenue of the abbey was nearly $600,000, a sum which amounted to more
than $20 per household.But the largest landed proprietor was the King; and food, drink, and
articles of clothing were supplied to the court by the villa system.
The royal capitularies give the exact details as to the industrial
administration of an estate. There were many outbuildings included in
the royal villa, such as kitchens, bakeries, stables, dairies, etc.
Fisheries, too, were encouraged. There were vegetable gardens and
flower gardens, in which seventy-four kinds of plants were cultivated,
among them many of the vegetables in common use at the present time,
and sixteen species of trees, including fig, pear, apple, peach, and
cherry trees. In the villa were found various kinds of artisans,
smiths, workers in precious metals, cobblers, saddlers, carpenters,
turners, rope makers. The women’s apartments were provided with rooms
artificially heated, and in them women wove wool and linen goods, and
also prepared them for use by dyeing, although it must be noted that
the range of coloring matters was limited. The staff was organized into
a kind of industrial hierarchy under special officers, who supervised
the work or kept the accounts. Over all stood the “mayor,” who had the
supervision of as much land in his district as he could visit in a day.Care was exercised by the Emperor that these dependents should receive
enough to live on; no one was to be reduced to poverty, and provision
was made to protect all from unjust treatment at the hands of their
superiors. The maximum price of staple articles, such as wheat
and wine, was fixed; cornering the market was forbidden, likewise
exportation from a given locality when crops were poor. The bishops and
counts were charged to see that the owners of estates looked after the
indigent, whether slave or free, lest any should die of hunger.Economically the monasteries were really productive centers. Their
artisans at first supplied only the needs of the monastic community
itself; then, as there was a surplus, the abbots established industrial
centers for wider distribution outside the monastic precincts. The
oldest of such Carolingian factories, so far as we know, was St.
Riquier, which contained special quarters for each trade. Indeed, many
continental cities owe their origin to this industrial movement. The
workingmen were organized in unions, guilds, or confraternities, whose
purpose was primarily charity, resembling mutual aid societies, with
features providing for insurance in case of loss by fire or shipwreck.As villa manufacture was confined to articles of common need, more
elaborate tastes had to be gratified by importation from places beyond
the limits of the northern countries of Europe. The Emperor gave great
attention to guarding the frontiers, so that foreign commerce could be
carried on in security. The great trade routes followed the rivers.
There was a regularly developed system of markets and fairs held near
the cities and the monasteries, as in the case of St. Denis, near
Paris, where for a space of four weeks goods were exposed for sale by
traders from Spain, Southern France, and Lombardy.In Germany and in the more remote portions of the Empire, near the
Slavic frontiers, the government established shelters and exchange
offices for the convenience of merchants, and strict care was taken
that arms were not sold to the enemy. Chief among the entrepots of
commerce was the city of Mainz, famous for its cloth manufacture.
Charles planned to make of it the great imperial economic center, and
in pursuance of this program provided for the construction of a wooden
bridge over the Rhine. He proposed also to build a canal to connect the
Danube with the Rhine. But the bridge was destroyed by fire, and the
canal offered too serious difficulties for the engineers of his age to
surmount.Trade between the Empire and Great Britain and Ireland was encouraged.
There was a lighthouse at Boulogne, and at Quentovia, now Étaples,
a customs-house was established and placed under the supervision of
Gerrold, a shrewd man of affairs, abbot of St. Wandrile. The constant
stream of pilgrims passing from the islands was protected by the
Emperor, and they proved useful in drawing closer the commercial ties
with these remoter portions of the civilized world. Naturally the
Mediterranean commerce was the more important, and the Emperor was
careful to keep up good relations with Eastern princes, both Christian
and Moslem.Imports consisted of purple stuffs, silk cloaks of various colors,
worked leather, perfumes, unguents, and medicinal plants, spices,
Indian pearls, Egyptian papyrus, and even exotic animals, such as
monkeys and elephants. The cities in Southern France were especially
frequented for trade, many of them having a cosmopolitan population.
The Jews were valued for their business capacity, and also for their
knowledge of languages and medical science. They were not allowed to
own landed property, but no restrictions were placed on their loan
operations, or on their commercial ventures.A marked improvement is noted in the coinage. After 800 the bust of the
Emperor appears with an indication of the Roman military cloak and the
words “Carolus Imperator”; on the reverse is a temple with a cross and
the inscription “Religio Christiana.”The financial administration of the government offered few
complications, because the obligations on the state in the way of
expenses were most limited. The chief item in the imperial budget,
which preserved the personal and household character of the Merovingian
period, was for the maintenance of the royal palaces, for the presents
made by the king to churches, to foreign princes, or to the great
officers of the Empire. Direct taxes were of the capitation type,
graded according to the position of the individual taxed. The ordinary
fiscal resources were made up from the income of the King from his
own estates, from tributes paid by vassal nations, from war booty,
obligatory annual gifts, and indirect taxes. The revenue from the royal
estates, which were excellently managed, was considerable, and there
must have been a large sum credited to the account of booty from the
various successful wars.The “benevolences,” to use a term familiar in the constitutional and
financial history of England, were not fixed, and the records speak
in an indefinite way of the contribution offered by faithful subjects
of the Empire in the annual assemblies. But it is plain that these
so-called gifts included precious stones and valuable fabrics, as well
as gold and silver.The principal indirect taxes were in the form of personal service,
rather than in money payments. Local taxation meant special work on
roads, bridges, and making dikes. For the great bridge at Mainz, labor
was called for from many localities, because it was an imperial work,
intended for the common benefit of the whole Empire. Transportation
dues are frequently mentioned in the Carolingian laws, as well as
the right of “lodging,” by which the inhabitants of a community were
obliged to lodge and entertain the King and his officials on their
travels, and to receive the representatives of foreign powers and
others, to whom the royal privilege was given. A bishop, for example,
had the right to receive forty loaves a day, three lambs, three
measures of ale, a gallon of milk, three chickens, fifteen eggs, and
four measures of feed for his horses.The greatest difficulties of the government were not financial, but
military, for the state of warfare was almost continuous, especially
along the Alps, the Pyrenees, and from the Eider to the lower Danube.
The summons for calling together the units of the military forces
was either carried by means of direct envoys or by letters sent to
the counts, bishops, and abbots, and sometimes by the “missi.” These
officials had to see that all those who were liable to service should
be prepared to take their places when the call to arms was given. One
of the “missi” writes: “let all be so prepared that, if the order to
leave comes in the evening, they will leave without delay for Italy on
the morning of the next day, but if it comes in the morning, in the
evening of the same day.”The following letter, addressed to Fulrad, abbot of Saint Quentin,
gives the full text of one of these summonses: “Know, that we have
fixed this year our meeting place in the country of the Saxons, in
the Eastern part on the River Bota, at a place called Storosfurt. For
this reason we direct you to be at the said place on the 15th of June
accompanied by all your men, well armed and well equipped, so that
you may go under arms, wherever it seems good to us to direct you to
march. We expressly recommend you, in order that you may see that the
rest follow our directions, to proceed to the designated place, without
disturbance, by the shortest road, without taking anything from the
inhabitants but the grass, wood, and water you require. Let the men
of your company march constantly with the chariots and the horsemen,
and let them never leave them until they reach the meeting place, in
order that in the absence of their master they may not be tempted to
do evil.” Late comers were punished by being deprived of rations for
the time they were absent, if the period was short. They who failed to
appear altogether were exposed to pay a heavy fine proportionate to
their fortune. While on the march the troops, as we see by the terms of
Fulrad’s letter, were to receive from the inhabitants of the country
through which they passed fire, water, wood, and lodging, but nothing
else. They brought with them enough provisions to last three months,
and arms and clothing for six months. Each warrior was expected to have
a buckler, a lance or a sword, a bow with ten cords, and twelve arrows.
Those who were better off brought with them a better type of shield,
while the counts and those who served as substitutes for bishops and
abbots, wore a breastplate and a helmet. Some of the soldiers carried
slings, and, apparently, there were mounted divisions in the army. For
certain necessary parts of war-material the counts were personally
responsible, such as three kinds of battle-axe, skins, battering rams,
also for the transportation of these, and for all things required to
keep the various weapons in good condition, and for engineering tools.It is interesting to note how these warlike preparations were arranged
for. Ownership in land was the basis selected for apportioning the
expense. But as the man who had only a small estate could not bear such
an outlay, inequality of fortune had to be considered, and also the
distance to be traversed to the place of meeting. These points were
all kept in view by the legislation of the Emperor, but there was no
systematic attempt made to meet these difficulties. There were special
provisions intended to govern special cases. In the first place, the
call to arms was rarely made general. This was only done on exceptional
occasions, as in 773, for the Lombard war; in 775, in the war against
the Saxons, and in 792, in that against the Avars. In 807 account
was taken of the distance. The Saxons, for example, only sent one
man out of six against the Spaniards and the Avars; one out of three
was demanded against the Slavs; but in case of conflict with their
neighbors, the Suabi, all Saxon warriors had to take up arms. There was
also an apportionment according to race: the Franks were called upon
to confront the Saxons, the Lombards and Bavarians marched against the
Avars; while, in case of war with the Spanish Arabs, the Aquitanians,
the Southern Goths, the Provençals, and the Burgundians had to make up
the imperial army. In the war against the Slavs, the Emperor called
upon the Eastern Franks, the Saxons, the Alemanni, and the Thuringians.In 807 the Emperor made the following arrangement as to military
service: Every man who owned three manses had to appear under arms; of
two landowners, each one of whom had two manses, one was to provide the
equipment for the other, and he who could go earliest had to appear
for military duty. Of three landowners, who had but one manse apiece,
one must go, while the other two were to provide the equipment, and so
on, the same arrangement being applied to owners of smaller parcels of
ground. Another year, the duty of serving in the army began with the
owners of four manses. The working of this graduated system of service
was left in the hands of the “missus,” who made his arrangements in
view of the prospective campaign.It was evidently the Emperor’s purpose to make the burden as light as
possible for the small landholder, and at the same time the obligation
to serve was extended to those who had no landed property. So we find
it declared in 806 that “if there are six landless men who own each as
much as the value of six silver pennies, i.e., a pound and a half of
the metal, one has to serve and be equipped by the other five.” But the
freemen alone were not sufficient to fill up the ranks; for, under the
strict application of this system, no one was obliged to serve who held
land in dependence, or as a “beneficium” from a wealthy landowner, nor
did the obligation rest on those who had surrendered their lands to
the Church, or to a powerful layman, in order to receive it back again
under the conditions of a “beneficium.” This class were not wholly
free, nor were they actually landowners.The problem of keeping up the war strength without oppressing the small
landowner was solved in the following way: Charles called together,
under the following conditions, those who were his own tenants. “Let
every freeman,” he directed, “who owns absolutely four manses, or who
holds them from another in the relation of a ‘beneficium,’ undertake
to furnish his own equipment and join the army, either with his lord,
if his lord is going there, or with the count.” These distributions
enabled the Emperor to get recruits who otherwise would have escaped
service; the other more remote result was that the “beneficium” system
received legal recognition, and in this way the Emperor himself
coöperated in the disintegrating tendencies by which the feudalized
state finally destroyed the imperial system.The lot of the small landowner was made hard and unendurable under the
terms of the imperial military regulations, despite the compromises
intended by Charles to protect him. There was every inducement to
the owner of a small holding to give it up. We find, for example, an
imperial order forbidding freemen without permission from the Emperor
to enter the clerical profession, “for we have heard,” he says, “that
certain of them are not so much actuated by devotion as by a desire to
escape service in the army, and other public duties to the sovereign.”
The fact, too, that rules regulating this subject were extremely
complicated, led to all kinds of abuses on the part of those who were
intrusted with their execution. In a report made to the Emperor, we
read that “the poor people claim that, if one of them is not willing
to abandon his property to the bishop or abbot, or count, or ‘master
of a hundred,’ these officials find occasion to have him condemned and
compel him to go to the place where the army is mobilized, so that
being reduced to misery he is forced, whether he wants to or not, to
give up his property or sell it.” It was added that those who had made
this sacrifice were not disturbed.The recriminations of the poor were directed against clerical and
lay officers without distinction; and we hear of their grievances
against bishops, abbots, and their legal representatives, as well as
against the counts and other laymen. The Emperor’s efforts proved
futile, and he not only could not resist the movement of his age, but
he found himself promoting the evolution he criticised. He actually
gave exemptions under his own seal to a certain number of religious
houses. The counts, on their side, made a practice of giving exemptions
and dispensations from military service. The landlord was allowed a
kind of authority over the tenant in questions in which the holding of
land was not involved. The rule that each landowner must be conducted
to the place of mobilization by the count was broken, and the landed
proprietors were allowed to appear ready for service, at the head of
their tenants and dependents, a distinct anticipation of the later
feudal custom.The mass of the people did not fail to let their sentiments be known
when the Emperor proceeded to extend the privilege of quartering his
functionaries on private individuals. The imperial officers were
assaulted and their baggage stolen. There was much complaint, too, of
the incessant calls to military service. Many sacrificed, therefore,
their free status, which simply meant to them the constant obligation
to be under arms, and they entered the ecclesiastical profession
or became dependents of those who were more powerful. Carolingian
legislation permitted the freeman to “commend” himself to whomsoever he
would “after the death of his lord,” and so that process began by which
the central authority was robbed of its own subjects, the small, free
landowners. Thus it was that the medieval régime took definite shape
as a governmental hierarchy based on the possession of landed estates,
great and small, worked either by serfs or by tenants, related to their
overlord by various kinds of dependent tenures.

In his relations with the Church, Charles gave a liberal interpretation
to his acknowledged powers of guidance and direction; the kind of
rôle he was willing to undertake shows that he drew no hard and fast
line between the secular and spiritual prerogatives of a monarch.
For example, in the Adoptionist Controversy, he took the initiative
himself in settling a troublesome problem of theological speculation.
According to the Adoptionists, in Christ there are a divine personality
and a human personality, which latter becomes by adoption the Son of
God. This tenet was eagerly embraced in Spain, its two best-known
adherents being Elipandus, Archbishop of Toledo, and Felix, Bishop of
Urgel, the latter a city in the North of Spain under the authority of
the Frankish King, who, therefore, immediately took steps to bring the
subject in dispute before a council, assembled at Regensburg, “under
the orders of the most glorious and orthodox King Charles.” Felix was
convicted of false teaching and sent to Rome to appear before Pope
Hadrian. Though Felix was deprived of his bishopric he continued to be
supported by the Spanish episcopate, who collectively wrote to Charles
for his restoration. At Frankfort, in 794, a council of prelates from
various Frankish sees met and listened to the King, who read the letter
from the Spanish bishops. The council then heard a long technical
speech from their ruler on the questions at issue. The Bishop of Urgel
was again condemned, but the matter was not decided until a few years
later, in 799, when a long discussion, lasting over six days, took
place at Aix between Felix and Alcuin, the conclusion of which was
that Felix allowed that he was overcome in argument, and published a
retraction.Charles was equally interested in two other religious controversies of
his time, and he made his personal point of view predominant in spite
of the weight of church authority on the other side. At the Council of
Frankfort the bishops had received from Pope Hadrian the acts passed at
the Second General Council of Nicæa dealing with the subject of image
worship, a matter that had been debated with much violence in the East
and in Italy for several generations. At Frankfort it was supposed,
owing to an inability to understand the precise meaning of certain
Greek words, that the Nicene Council had formally ordered the adoration
of images, and its decrees were therefore rejected. The Emperor
undertook the defense of the Western point of view, and in doing so did
not hesitate to differ with Rome itself. He also took up an independent
position on a more vital point. It seems that during Leo III’s
pontificate certain French monks residing in the East were charged
with heresy because they inserted in the so-called Nicene Creed, in
the article dealing with the procession of the Holy Spirit, i.e.,
where it is stated that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, the
crucial word “filioque” (and from the Son). The matter was taken up by
Charles, and after this recondite theological point had been studied,
the action of the monks was officially sanctioned by the Council of
Aix-la-Chapelle, in 809, although the Pope refused to approve of any
addition to the historic formula of Christian belief.In considering the Frankish ruler’s attitude towards the Papacy, it is
well to remember that the later administrative system of the Curia,
which made so clear-cut the antagonism between the secular prince and
the ecclesiastical hierarchy in the medieval times after the age of
Hildebrand, had not yet been developed. Charles reverenced the Papacy;
indeed, the Pope’s counsel and the Pope’s words often played a decisive
part in influencing his motives. He was a convinced believer in the
Pope’s right to teach the faithful, and he saw in him the guardian of
apostolic tradition. It was to this tradition that he appealed when he
condemned the Adoptionists at the Council of Frankfort. The specific
rights of the Papacy, from this point of view, lay in its teaching
function and in its liturgical usages, which were to be taken by the
Christians of Charles’ dominions as the correct norm of their practice.
There was also a full recognition of the prerogatives of the Papacy in
phases of administration and discipline, wherever ancient precedents
could be cited. So we find Charles appealing, in the renewed disputes
between the sees of Arles and Vienne, to the ancient directions of the
Roman bishops governing this question.But this recognition of the rights of Rome did not prevent Charles from
regarding himself as the director of the Frankish Church. He speaks
openly of himself as “the pilot of the Church in his domains,” and
when writing Leo III he explains his conception of the relation of the
kingdom and the Papacy. “Our task it is, by the help of God, to protect
by our arms outwardly the Holy Church of Christ from assaults of the
heathen and from being wasted by the unbelievers and to establish it
within by recognizing the Catholic faith. Your duty it is to support
as Moses did, with uplifted arms our service in the battlefield, that
the Christian people, being led through your petitions and prepared
by God, may have constantly and everywhere victory over the enemies
of His name.” While Charles assigned to the Pope a religious activity
and nothing more, he regarded his own guardianship over the churches
as extending beyond questions of their material welfare. In 789 in
a message to the bishops he stated that he wished to coöperate with
them, using his power as a ruler, and working through his subordinates
to improve things where improvement was possible. These were the
principles he used in his Church policy. Just as in secular matters he
was not absolute, but followed the laws and customs of the people over
whom he ruled, so in regard to the Church he observed its canonical
system with a reverence for its minute details. But his capitularies,
as we have seen, are filled with ecclesiastical legislation, and in
Church matters the King acted as the supreme authority. Even synods
laid their decrees before him for correction, and to secure his
authoritative sanction. There was little place for a fully developed
Papacy in an ecclesiastical system worked along these lines, and there
are no examples during Charles’ reign of Papal interference in the
administration of the Church in his own domains. The Pope, where and
when he did act, did so in concert with Charles; even in cases of
excommunication there was an understanding with the King; and often the
extreme penalty was inflicted under his initiative. Even the exercise
of discipline in connection with the episcopate was left in Charles’
hands without any protest on the part of the Pope.These religious activities of Charles seemed natural to his
contemporaries. Alcuin says of him that he was armed with two swords,
the one to smite false teaching in the bosom of the Church, the other
to protect it from the devastations of the heathen. He speaks of
Charles as a parent and teacher, under whose rule the Church is placed;
yet at the same time Alcuin had the highest reverence for the Papacy
and never thought of the possibility of conflict between the Pope and
the Emperor. In Rome itself there was no formal acceptance of this
Frankish conception of an ecclesiastical polity in which the Pope’s
place was that of a fifth wheel to the coach. Roman enthusiasm for the
Emperor, as expressed by the Roman clergy, was limited to encomiums on
him as protector of the Church. He was spoken of as the faithful ruler,
who, by his energy and his benefactions, was doing valiant work for
Rome and for the Papacy.In matters of internal Church administration, the influence of the
King was often paramount in questions affecting diocesan order. There
was nothing revolutionary here, for the independence of the Church
from the State implied a situation that was never dreamed of at this
period, nor had it really existed since the time of Constantine.
Theoretically, the choice of a bishop belonged rightfully to the clergy
and to the laity of a diocese, but, as a matter of fact, the monarch
controlled episcopal elections. These could not take place until the
royal sanction had been secured, and the official in whose presence
the electoral machinery was set in motion was an appointee of the
King. The official papers recording the election had to be sent to the
palace, and the successful candidate could not be consecrated except
with the King’s approval. Often Charles himself selected the candidate;
besides, if a man were known to be favored by him, he would, on the
strength of this fact, be elected. Where bishops were to be appointed
for sees created in territory newly conquered from the heathen, they
were named by Charles without the form of an election. What is true of
bishops holds also with regard to abbots, who, on account of the great
expansion of monastic life, were of more importance than a diocesan
bishop. Church councils were summoned by Charles; he could preside over
them, and only through his consent were the decrees they passed valid.
Much attention was given to a systematic organization of the hierarchy.
There were twenty-two metropolitical sees in the Empire, and the bishop
was given real and effective charge of the clergy under him. Counties
and parishes, throughout the imperial domains especially, were growing
in number, and were placed in the newly acquired territories under an
assistant bishop.
XI THE EMPIRE WITHOUT AND WITHIN
The diplomacy, as well as the strategy, of the Emperor was worthy of
a far-seeing and cautious ruler. He kept the frontiers of the Empire
assured by fortifications, wherever there was prospect of direct attack
from the Danes or the Slavs, and by such means saw to it that the
tribes bordering on the lines of defense were kept in awe and reduced
to a state of dependence. In other places where the more distant
Avars and the Bulgars might ultimately give trouble, the Emperor
had taken care to come to a friendly arrangement with the Eastern
Empire for mutual protection. This understanding did not, it is true,
prevent friction between the two powers on the Adriatic Sea, where
on several occasions the armies had met to decide their differences
by arms. But on neither side was there any intention of developing
consistent schemes for conquering the territory of the rival emperor.
Disturbances were local and the border population was itself uncertain
in allegiance, and ready to accept the guidance of its interests in
determining the direction of its loyalty. This kind of hesitancy was
not found in Italy, which remained inviolably faithful to Charles’ rule.The rulers of Constantinople had no time nor inclination to repeat
the experiment of Justinian and Constans during the reign of Charles;
they were weakened by serious difficulties of their own, due to
disputed succession and religious conflict, and to the need of constant
watchfulness against Moslem aggression. It was fortunate for both
empires that the Saracens were not united. This was the most decisive
factor, indeed, of the history of this period. The East was freed from
the type of attack which had kept Leo the Isaurian constantly on the
defensive, and which only his high military talents were able to cope
with, while in the West the inability of the Moslems to act together
made it possible for Charles to expand his territory and to give the
time needed for internal development in the consolidation of his rule.It was one of the most permanent results of the activity of Charles
as a conqueror that in the Spanish peninsula he strengthened not only
the natural position of the petty and struggling Christian kingdoms,
but by his personality made the ideal of a Christian ruler respected
there, and so assured for the Christians in Spain a future which
could be realized only when they had lived down their particularism
and recognized the value of solidarity. But the wider field of armed
conflict for the peoples included in his realm would have meant little,
if it had not been accompanied by opportunities for real social
progress.The empire of Charles, though it was the concrete creation of an
ideal government crudely understood and most inadequately worked out,
illustrated the liberty-loving principles of the Germanic peoples who
were gathered in its fold. In this respect, with all its imperfections,
the rule of the great Frankish monarch is more closely allied to the
political principles of modern times than were the more ambitious and
more logical creations of the conquerors who preceded and who followed
him. Unconsciously, it may be, his system of government gave scope for
local diversities and recognized rights of deep-planted traditions
with a generosity which is characteristic not of empires such as those
of Cæsar and Napoleon, but of federal republics of the type of the
United States, and the Federation of the Swiss Cantons. When he aimed
at uniformity he did not lose sight of the fact that he was the ruler
of heterogeneous nationalities, on whose good-will and coöperation the
permanence of the Empire was dependent. The pressure of centralization
was lightly exercised, simply because in the Emperor’s mind the ideas
of Roman rule had to pass through the medium of German tribal tradition.There was no steam roller set to work to equalize, if not to pulverize,
the component parts of his realm. The divisions were not destroyed,
but were rather combined in a higher political unity. The kingdom
of the West Goths was at least preserved, though it had less of a
definite character than the Lombard kingdom, which the Emperor took
special pains to preserve in its integrity. Even the traditions of the
Ostrogoths were allowed a value in so far as they stood for a strenuous
opposition to the imperial policy of uniformity of administration
and to the economic sacrifice of the local centers to the purposes
of world politics. Lombard influence had overcome both Ostrogothic
and Roman rule; it was irreconcilable, and stood for the stubborn
and conservative standpoint that made the first Germanic invaders
difficult to assimilate in the provinces of the Roman Empire, where by
force of arms they became the ruling class. A similar obstinacy, with
its preservation of the original political type, marked the Lombard
kingdom and duchies which Charles had conquered. A picturesque example
of local initiative was not crowded out by the Frankish overlordship
in Venice; the seafaring community came into being in a favored spot,
on the confines of the two empires, too remote to be crushed from
Constantinople, and protected from the Western ruler by a few leagues
of shallow sea.The same centrifugal tendencies are seen in Southern Italy; and what is
more important, in Northern and Central Italy, there was no attempt
to stifle the germs of municipal activity which produced, later on,
such marvelous fruitage in the Italian town life of the Middle Ages.
The contrast between the Germanic and Roman elements in the Empire
faded away gradually under the Emperor’s administration, but Roman
civilization could not be eclipsed, while the laws of Justinian
continued to be quoted as a model, and while the Church with its
general use of the Latin language was regarded as the chief adjunct and
support of continuity in imperial rule.The union of the Empire and the Papacy kept up that tradition of
civilization by which the isolation of Germanic tribal life was swept
aside, and the Germans learned that there were other governmental
principles than custom, and began to see that might was not the only
right. The institutions of the Church did more than preserve the ideal
element for the individual and for society. They stood for continuity
in securing the best achievements of classic culture in government and
in learning, and prevented just that kind of social cataclysm which
marked the progress of Islam, when it attempted to handle mankind in
the mass. Reverence for the Holy Scriptures, however imperfect may
have been the acquaintance with them, had a powerful influence in
maintaining the connection of Church and State, and acted constantly
against the divisive tendencies of racial rule.The Celts of Western France, the remnant of the people who had once
dominated the whole of Occidental Europe, were brought into the sphere
of general European life, and the same opportunities were given to
the Germanic peoples. Allied with the population of Latin origin,
they extended their sway over a territory which before had never felt
the influence of centralization. The union of the two elements was of
momentous importance, and this achievement stands out as the abiding
result of the Emperor’s conquest. France and Germany made up a whole,
in which the Teutonic element had a superior position, but without
tyrannizing over the peoples of the Romance stock. In Burgundy and
Neustria the elements of Latin blood were strongest, and the contrast
gave a peculiar character to Austrasia.The most significant factor of the Emperor’s rule was that it offered
a center of unity to the Teutonic tribes, consolidating them, where
the Merovingian kingdoms, which also stood for the old Germanic tribal
traditions, had shown complete incapacity. But under the Carolingian
rule, neither the Alemanni, nor the Bavarians, nor the Saxons, could
claim predominance, for the sovereign’s authority was exercised
apart from all these tribal influences, and yet at the same time the
characteristics of the tribe, local sentiment, and customary law, were
not broken up by the central government. The Teutonic local division,
the “Gau,” was no more interfered with than the Gallic “Civitas.” The
power at the top of all, formed by the armed hosts of the component
parts of the Empire and by the clergy, was expressed in institutions
that kept the body politic together. In the assemblies, all the
different nationalities took part, and acted under the guidance of the
single will of a single ruler, who was kept from the capricious action
of a tyrant by his firm hold on the ideal of a Christian commonwealth.
The principles of the whole imperial system harmonized with popular
governmental traditions, and both in their social and in their
religious aspects answered to the popular conceptions of membership in
a world-wide church.Charles, in his plans for the succession, looked forward to a ruling
family controlling by descent a singularly heterogeneous collection
of races. It is unthinkable, as an historical principle, that the
traditions and customs of race and tribe could be long suppressed.
Since the time of Germanic invasions they had been the most potent
factor in the evolution of Western Europe; and, though they were kept
in the background by the energy and character of the Emperor, it only
needed a few crises to call them forth into activity. Out of the
interplay of these tribal interests and racial divergencies has grown
modern Europe.A further weakness in the Carolingian structure was due to the
relation of the secular and the ecclesiastical authority. The grounds
of conflict, even in Charles’ own time, were never far distant. The
Emperor’s diplomacy and personality smoothed the acerbities away, and
his attitude of compromise found ready imitators in such Popes as
Hadrian I and Leo III. There would have been a different outcome if,
on his visits to Rome, he had been faced by a Pope of the temperament
of Nicholas I. The possible independence of the spiritual power the
Emperor did little to prevent by legislation. There was no way of
avoiding such disputes, and the struggles for supremacy between Empire
and Papacy attained their full development in the thirteenth century.Charles, too, showed no willingness to deal radically with the
customary laws of succession of the Frankish people, and in this sphere
he was far more conservative than the Lombards or the Ostrogoths. The
principle of division among the heirs rather than unity of territory,
meant in itself a great danger. It would have caused trouble to Charles
himself had not his brother been removed by death early in the reign.
Yet the Emperor set a strong precedent for its recognition in his own
disposition of the Empire among his three sons. The position of Louis
was due to an accident, and the old question was bound to emerge again
when the rights of his various children, as his heirs, came to be
considered. Nothing was done to prescribe how the exercise of sole rule
as Emperor was to be carried out when the subordinate rulers of his own
house proved reluctant to obey their head.The Empire plainly was only secure if its various rulers could consent
to work harmoniously together; a division among them, a break between
the Church and the State, the exaltation of the idea of nationality and
race, were all possibilities which would surely destroy the integrity
of Charles’ imperial construction. The history of the century after his
death shows the weak sides of the Emperor’s benevolent optimism. He
contemplated a great Christian republic directed by a family united in
its members and guided by patriarchal instinct. In working out this
program, Charles was an opportunist as well as an optimist; he took the
component political factors as he found them, and introduced them as
the stones of a mosaic, thinking more of the whole than of the parts,
seemingly oblivious of the disparity of the elements he was introducing
into the fabric. The distinctions of race were certain to become
accentuated the moment the central power showed weakness and proved
itself unable to be an effectual protection against anarchy within or
attacks from the outside.In its political creativeness the Emperor’s work was framed on a
smaller scale than he contemplated. He proposed an Empire, but he
really founded kingdoms--the historic kingdoms of Western Europe. The
inheritors of his system were the territorial monarchs, who took from
him the conception of a supreme secular power closely united with the
Church. The actual central authority established by Charles soon passed
away, but the peoples included within it, endowed with the energy
proceeding from him, as a source, survived and developed. The ground
prepared by him was the foundation for the national kingdoms with
whose vicissitudes and progress the course of civilization has been
unalterably connected. He has been well named, therefore, the Patriarch
of Europe, the Abraham in whose seed the political world has been
blessed.The ablest monarchs of Europe, both in the Middle Ages and in modern
times, from Otto III to Napoleon, including Frederic Barbarossa and
Louis XIV, all have felt the power of his personality. Napoleon speaks
of him as his illustrious predecessor. Yet, as a politician, Charles
was inferior to his father, Pippin, whose shrewdness in arranging
momentous political combinations he did not inherit, and on the field
of battle he was not the equal of his grandfather, Charles Martel. He
never won a battle such as Poictiers, and with one or two exceptions
the narrative of his campaigns shows nothing of the skilful and
spectacular generalship of Belisarius.In his wars no unusual gifts of strategy were required; no great
mastery of tactics was necessary. But he was what one of his
contemporaries declared, “the powerful fighter who smote the Saxons
and humbled the hearts of the Franks and Barbarians, who had been able
to resist the might of the Romans.” His campaigns attest energy and
obstinacy, a clear-sighted ability to see when and where a decisive
blow must be delivered. He never lost his head in a dangerous position,
and so he was able to take in a military problem in its various
aspects, and while resting at one stage of a conflict, he could quietly
prepare to overcome his adversaries in a second move.His mind was well balanced, it worked logically and with a large
vision, and he aimed at acting in such a way that the innumerable
details of his work as ruler would be explicable and could harmonize
as parts of a well-considered whole. He was general-in-chief, and he
also realized as we have seen, Constantine’s description of himself in
relation to the Church, as “chief bishop for its external affairs.”
As a judge, Charles was the supreme court of appeal, and was in
this capacity remarkable for his severity and unsparing attitude
to the guilty. Though he was not a genius as an administrator, he
showed industry and judgment in using and in improving such organs
of government as were known in his day in Western Europe. As we have
pointed out, his capitularies show him to us as a great landlord,
familiar with agricultural methods, able to measure the economic needs
of a large estate, and to act accordingly, possessing an extraordinary
amount of practical energy and versatility.There was no limit to his interests, and he brought in a high
conception of duty. Up to the close of his life nothing was too small
to escape his personal supervision; he kept count of the chickens
on his personal estates, dictated his capitularies, and learned the
art of writing, a rare accomplishment, and deemed among the Teutonic
races the special work of a cleric. He presided over assemblies and
councils, ordered the system of chanting in his private chapel, and
hardly a year passed by that he did not visit one of the frontiers of
the Empire. His mental capacity was characterized by something of the
mobility which belonged to the Renaissance period, a trait not seen
among medieval rulers, and perhaps paralleled only in the case of
Frederick II. His talents were not employed towards futile ends; he
economized them, and while he was open to impressions, he kept with
scrupulousness his store of energy under control. He was free from
Napoleon’s defect of fitting all things as parts of a rigid system, and
he knew when to keep his hands from disarranging a firmly established
social order.It may be that a larger measure of interference from him would have
prevented the growth of feudal privileges which the land system of
Western Europe was already producing. This evolution he did not
oppose; in some cases his own acts furthered it. The court and “missi”
under his direction became, as it were, observers and directors of a
naturally developing type of local administration which the general
ordinances of the Empire did nothing to repress. Feudal customs, still,
of course, in their germ, were pressed into the service of the state,
as for example when the lord was required to appear accompanied by his
dependents at the general military assembly of the King. The Emperor
was quick in reconciling local divergencies, and in discerning some
easily practicable method of making seemingly irreconcilable factors
contribute mutually to his ends. When a governmental order failed,
he was fertile in discerning an immediate remedy, careless whether
the innovation of a reform could be theoretically accommodated to the
administration as it before existed. Wherever the structure he planned
turned out faulty, he went to work with the spirit of an artist who
thinks more of the safety of the whole building than of the harmony of
its parts. His ideal of rule was always before him, yet there was none
of the stage effect of which Napoleon was so fond. He did not try to
impress upon others principles that did not attract his own sympathies.
He believed in what he did and believed the way he was doing it was
consistent with his own ideals of right, personal and social. The
empire was to be a community guided by Christian standards, a visible
embodiment of the City of God, as understood in his day.The dream was a mighty one, and proved inspiring largely because it was
impersonal. The Emperor stood as the champion, unselfish and devoted,
of progress, so far as his age appreciated that much abused term. It
was, at least, a reality in respect to the conscious effort on his
part to moralize government, and by doing so to contribute to an ideal
solidarity of men and races. Yet the task he had assigned himself was
too great; and his work remained but an unfinished sketch, soon to be
demolished in the troublous and hopeless reigns of his descendants.  *  *  *  *  *THE OTTOMANS
I OSMAN
The empire of the Seldjoukian Turks by which the crusading conquests
were destroyed, showed no greater powers of endurance than the
other creations of Moslem rule; it did not escape the tendency to
dismemberment due to the transfer of personal and autocratic control
into the hands of rulers of mediocre ability. By the beginning of the
fourteenth century the effect of disintegration showed itself plainly
and definitely in Western Asia throughout the territory which had
been won from the Emperors of Eastern Rome. One of the results of the
expansion of the Mongol conquests towards the West was to hasten not
only the division among the Seldjouks, but their speedy downfall. Their
Sultans found no safety against the pressure of the Mongols on their
territories, even though they combined with their Christian neighbors,
with whom they had kept up for so long incessant warfare, against a
danger which threatened annihilation to all races and peoples in the
path of the Mongol hordes from the East. The Turks made peace with
the Greeks at Nicæa, and even engaged the help of Frankish mercenary
troops, but these counsels of despair did not save them from becoming
tributaries to the Mongol rulers of Asia.As early as 1243 the fatal course of the decadence was marked by
constant defeat, and from this time on they were not able to defend
their position. The Sultanate came practically to an end with the death
of Masud II of Iconium, who was murdered by one of his emirs, though
the Mongols continued the office, ruling under the name of Alaed-Din
II, 1297-1307. Of the ten fragments which represented the former
empire of the Seldjouks, one was controlled by Osman, from whose name
the latest and most enduring effort to establish a Moslem world power
takes its origin. Within the restricted bounds of a small emirate,
whose most important point was the ancient city of Dorlæum, now called
Sultan-Oeni, was trained and developed the people who were destined to
make great European conquests lasting down to our own day, to threaten
for many centuries Christian powers at their most vulnerable centers,
and, finally, when their own ability to conquer and devastate had come
to an end, to stir up such constant jealousies among the states which
claimed the succession to their dominions in Europe, that some of the
most disastrous and hardly contested wars in the nineteenth century
have been due to their presence on European soil.No more than in the case of Mohammed could such far-reaching
consequences have been detected in the obscure beginnings of the
people over whom Osman began to rule as an independent prince. Nearly
a century before, his ancestor Souliman had led a migration from
Khorassan; with tribal adherents numbering 150,000, he took possession
of lands near Erzendjan and Akhlath; then came the invasion of the
Mongols, which brought ruin to these plans of settlement. Souliman,
in his flight from the invaders, was drowned as he was crossing the
Euphrates at a place called to-day Turk-Mesari, the tomb of the Turk.
On his death the nomads who followed his leadership were dispersed;
even his four sons failed to keep together. Two returned to the place
from which they had come, while the other two, Dundar and Ertoghroul,
keeping four hundred families with them, occupied territories near
Erzeroum. But as the proximity of the Mongols held out no prospect of
peaceful possession, the two brothers continued their march westward,
and finally put themselves under the protection of Ala-ed-Din I, Sultan
of the Seldjouks. (1219-1234.)According to the legendary account, while Ertoghroul was making his
way West, he found himself on the top of a mountain ridge, where,
looking down on the plain, he saw two armies about to engage each
other. He decided to help those who were weaker, and adding his
warriors to those who were giving way, he put the enemy to flight.
At the close of the battle he found that he had brought victory over
a horde of Mongols to the armies of Ala-ed-Din I, who, as a reward
for this unexpected aid, gave the newcomers the mountain regions of
Toumanidj and Ermeni as a dwelling place in summer, and the plain of
Soegud for their winter quarters. Ertoghroul showed his loyalty to his
new sovereign by undertaking successful raids against the outposts of
the Greek Empire of Nicæa in parts adjacent to his own lands. Although
under a Moslem overlord, Ertoghroul and his people still continued
faithful to their ancestral polytheism, but he showed such great
respect for the sacred volume of Mohammed, that it was not surprising
when his son and successor, Osman or Othman (1288-1326), became
converted to the religion of Islam.This important event was connected with his marriage with the daughter
of a cheikh belonging to the Seldjouks, Edebali, who, according to the
legends of the Ottoman race, mysteriously foretold the future greatness
of his son-in-law, and worked actively for the conversion of all his
people. Up to this time the followers of Osman were nothing more than a
band of nomads of mixed race composed of Turcomans, probably containing
two Mongol elements. This change of religion not only gave them unity,
but enabled them in the critical period of the Mongol conquests to act
as a center around which were gathered all those of the Turkish race
who held to Mohammedan orthodoxy. The first step was the absorption of
the Seldjouks, a process natural enough because of racial affinity, but
as time went on religious professions, not racial relationship, became
so predominant a characteristic in Ottoman rule, that converts of all
nationalities, Greeks, Slavs, Albanians, Roumanians, and Magyars, were
absorbed without prejudice as to racial origin, and from the mere
fact of profession of Mohammedanism were recognized just as fully as
Ottoman Turks as if they had descended from the parent stock.The social phenomenon of Western Europe, where the cohesive force of
Christianity brought together people of Germanic, Celtic, and Roman
origin, found its counterpart in this new national development of
Mohammedan orthodoxy. It took place, too, just at a time when the old
supporters of Islam, the Arabs, the Persians, and the Berbers had
entered upon a stage of decadence. As a political power Islam was going
to pieces, when new vigor was infused into it by a fresh and warlike
race of barbarians, who, as convinced converts with all the fanaticism
of a recently acquired faith, restored the simpler traditions of
the Koran that had been lost or weakened, wherever the disciples
of Mohammed were brought in contact with civilizing influences or
wherever, in their mutual divisions, they had made terms of alliance
with Christian rulers.Predatory warfare was the training which gave the Ottoman Turks their
irresistible power as conquerors; they were organized as an army
disciplined and ever ready to strike. No better field for such training
could have been found than the territory of Anatolia when the empire of
the Seldjouks disappeared, and a condition of affairs arose, of which
Northern Spain, at a somewhat earlier period, is a parallel instance of
prevailing anarchy and local turmoil.Some of the semi-independent fortresses under Greek commanders,
who presided over narrow territories in the same way as the feudal
seigneurs of Western Europe, were reduced by Osman. With these
additions to his domains he had no hesitation in proclaiming himself
an independent prince on the death of Ala-ed-Din. Soon afterward he
conquered all the region near the river Songora, which gave approach
to the sea coast and so offered an opportunity for equipping piratical
expeditions that terrorized the islands and shores of the Greek Empire
and the Latin states of the East. At this time the emirate under Osman
covered the greater part of the ancient provinces of Galatia and
Bithynia.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'To this position of mastery must be ascribed the rapid acquisition of
leadership by Osman. The territory he now governed was close to the
important centers of Greek rule. Broussa, Nicæa, and Nicomedia were the
specially selected points of attack in this effort to extend Moslem
power over Northwestern Asia, which still remained in Christian hands.
The prizes were great and the religious merit considerable; there was
enough, then, to attract the most valiant warriors who joined the army
of Osman from other emirates. Even mercenary troops of Greek, Slavic,
and Latin origin served under the Turkish banner.The plan of conquest showed skilful and cautious strategy. Osman
adopted the policy of overshadowing the great fortresses of the Greek
Empire by placing near them strongholds of his own garrisoned with men
ready to surprise their opponents at the first favorable opportunity.
Broussa soon found itself within the grasp of the Turk. There were
two forts dominating its very gates, one on the east, the other on
the west. An important town near it, Edrenos, was taken when Osman’s
son, Ourkhan, forced the city to capitulate, the inhabitants being
given, in return for 30,000 pieces of gold, the right to retire with
their property. The governor became a convert to Islam--a detail which
is typical of the Turkish conquests. These new supporters found it
to their advantage to change their allegiance. Such cases are often
mentioned in these early years of the expansion of the Ottoman emirate,
and they are indicative of a well-devised policy to sap the foundations
of resistance.Another even more striking example of the results of a change of
allegiance from Christianity to Mohammedanism is found in the case of
Mikhal-Koeze (Michael with the pointed beard), the Greek governor of
the castle, who, after becoming a prisoner of war, was most kindly
treated by Osman. The bonds of friendship between the two grew so
strong that Mikhal embraced Islamism and signalized himself by his
fidelity as an ally and subordinate officer. He is the ancestor of
the family of Mikhal Oghli (sons of Michael), who in a long line of
descent held the command of the irregular troops in the Turkish army.The close of Osman’s career had nothing to record in the way of an
exploit equal to the capture of Broussa. In 1326 the conqueror died
and was buried in the city, the possession of which marked the chief
success of his remarkable reign. Here in after generations were
shown the chaplet of rough-ground wood, the enormous drum given him
by Ali-ed-Din, and the great carved double-edged sword wielded by
the founder and champion of the Ottoman Empire. But the rapidity and
importance of Osman’s conquests had not changed the tastes of the
tribal chieftain; all that he left to his heirs were horses, oxen, some
sheep, a spoon, a salt cellar, an embroidered kaftan, and a turban.Ourkhan, who followed Osman, proved that he had inherited his father’s
capacity for war and statesmanship. His brother was made vizier, with
special charge of the organization of the army, which, in its various
arms, preserved for centuries the marks of a military intelligence
far superior to that shown in the organization of the armies of
medieval Europe. The regular troops were divided into janitschars (foot
soldiers), and spahis (horsemen), while the irregular forces had the
same two divisions under the names of akindji and azabs.The advance of conquest still went on upon a large scale. Soon
Nicomedia, the ancient capital of Diocletian, surrendered to the
Turks. In a battle at Maldepe the Greek Emperor Andronicus III
suffered a defeat that led to the loss of all the Asiatic possessions
of the Greeks. Nicæa, the second city of the empire, was obliged to
yield to the conqueror, who gave the inhabitants the same terms as
those accorded to the people of Broussa. The moral effect of this
blow was immense, because Nicæa had been the starting point for the
revival of Greek civilization and political rule after the taking of
Constantinople by the Latins. It was also sacred as the seat of two
great ecumenical councils. Now, the church where the Nicene Creed was
proclaimed, became a mosque, and the city, with its name transformed
into the Turkish disguise of Isnik, lost its historical identity.
(1330.)After the seizure of some small seaports on the Black Sea and the
Propontis, the whole of Bithynia fell into Turkish hands. There were
only the narrow straits between the Osmanlis and Europe; on the Asiatic
side the only places which still belonged to the Greek Empire were
Scutari and Philadelphia. As Ourkhan’s dominions expanded, he followed
his father’s precedent in dividing the land into sandjaks (banners).
Nicæa was intrusted, on account of its importance, to the eldest son,
Souliman, who then, on his own account, resolved to attempt the passage
into Europe. In his adventure he was accompanied only by a handful of
companions; two rafts were constructed of the trunks of trees joined by
thongs of leather, and with these a landing was made at Tzympe, which
was seized without trouble, as the fortifications of the place had
fallen into ruins (1356).Not long after this event an earthquake shook the walls of Gallipoli
and other neighboring towns, a misfortune which made them all an easy
prey for Souliman’s officers. When the Greek Emperor protested, Ourkhan
answered that his latest conquests were due, not to his arms, but to
the will of God that had been revealed in the earthquake. Gallipoli
was the key to Europe, and it was not given up. Using it as a base,
the Osmanlis commenced to make marauding expeditions into the adjacent
country.
II MURAD I
There followed in succession to Ourkhan, not Souliman, who died in one
of the raids into Thrace, but Murad I, whose mother was a Greek. In
some respects he was a greater leader than his father, Ourkhan; he is
spoken of in the chronicles as eloquent, devoted to justice, and a
strict disciplinarian. At the same time he was beloved by his troops
because of his generosity. Although he had no education, not even the
ability to read and write, he was known as a great builder of mosques,
schools, and hospitals. When he had a document to sign he dipped
four fingers in the ink, and, keeping them as far apart as possible,
impressed them on the paper; the impression so made was worked up
artistically into the imperial Osmanli seal. His success in warfare
was due not only to his own valor, but also to the number of able
commanders who conducted his campaigns under his directions.The European successes of his elder brother could not be followed up
immediately, because the notable victories of the Osmanlis had excited
the jealousy of the remaining Seldjouk emirs in Asia. Ourkhan had
himself warred with the Prince of Karasi and so been able to add Mysia
with Pergamum to his territories. Now Murad’s reign was opened by a
contest with the emir of Karamania, another Ala-ed-Din, who stirred
up many of the Osmanli dependencies to revolt. The city of Angora was
the center of this insurrection. Murad overcame the rebels, placed a
garrison in Angora, and adopted a policy of gradual absorption in order
to keep the Seldjouk emirates from forming a coalition against him.
One was ceded outright and a large part of another became the marriage
portion of the wife of Bajesid, son of Murad. The situation in Asia,
owing to the restlessness of the remaining emirs, who represented
another branch of the Turkish stock, continued to be a source of
difficulty for many years, and the final and complete conquest of the
whole of Anatolia only took place when the European Empire of the
Osmanlis was an accomplished fact.The armies of Murad had now occupied Thrace; hence they were brought
into immediate contact with the two strong Slavic nations on the Balkan
peninsula, the Bulgarians and the Servians. These South Slavic peoples,
after centuries of struggle for supremacy with the Eastern Empire, had
been overpowered by the superior wealth, strategy, and civilization of
the rulers of Constantinople in the beginning of the eleventh century.
But the Latin conquest of Constantinople made it easy for them to
regain the ground they had lost. In the course of the struggle between
the Byzantines and the Crusaders, the movements towards independence
among the Servians and Bulgarians were facilitated. After the year 1261
accessions of territory were made by both branches of the Slavic race.
Besides contesting possession of Balkan territory with the Magyars they
warred among themselves for the acquisition of lands in the Maritza
basin and along the rivers Strouma and Vardar.In this rivalry the Servians secured the greatest prizes in the way
of territorial expansion. By the end of the thirteenth century they
had reached the sea coast, and had occupied the region around the two
lakes Ochrida and Prespa. About the same time the movement to expand
their frontiers at the expense of the Greek Empire again became marked.
Northern Albania was conquered and additional lands were seized in
Macedonia. These successes led to a coalition between the Bulgars and
the Greeks; but this scheme to block the Servians failed. There was a
great battle at Velbouje, at which the Bulgarian army was completely
crushed. The plan of the Servians was to secure the alliance of their
rivals by a marriage between their leader, Stephen Douchan, and the
sister of Tsar Michael, the head of the Bulgars.Douchan is often called the Charlemagne of Servia, but the title is
only true if measured by an unrealized dream. His reign marks the
limit of Servian ambition; he looked forward to an imperial position
under which the Slavs would become the heirs of the dignities and
domains of the Byzantine Empire, a position they deserved because of
the inability of the Greeks to defend their lands from the advancing
power of the Turk. For a time the dream seemed on the point of
realization, as Douchan’s various campaigns against the Greeks were
successful. The alliance with the Bulgars was maintained unbroken, and
only a very small part of the European possessions of the Emperors at
Constantinople remained intact. Thrace and a strip of Asia Minor was
all that was left; there was every reason to urge Douchan to proclaim
his overlordship in the regular way. Accordingly, on April 16, 1346,
Douchan was solemnly anointed Emperor (Tsar) of Servia and Roumania by
the Servian Patriarch Joannikos, at Uskup.The next step was the conquest of the imperial city on the Bosphorus.
This could not be effected without a fleet; neither Thessalonika nor
Constantinople could be taken as long as their ports were open. Douchan
turned to the Venetians for help, but they refused to encourage the
formation of a new great power on the Mediterranean. Besides, the
Turks now barred the way, for Gallipoli had been garrisoned. The
Osmanlis, therefore, held the key to the Dardanelles. Undeterred,
however, by these changes, Douchan girded himself for a final attack
on Constantinople, when death overtook him suddenly on the 20th of
December, 1355.His successor, Ourach, was only nineteen years old, a young man of mild
character, with none of the stern qualities needed to carry out the
warlike plans of his father. His vassal lords had not lived long enough
under a centralized system to understand its advantages even under
a weak ruler. Without the strong personality of Douchan, the empire
and the titular dignity of Tsar were only shadows. Less fortunate
than the tribe of Osman, where the line from father to son maintained
in unbroken succession under strong personal rule the clear-sighted
aims of the founder, the Servians could not resist the forces of
disintegration. Their country was mountainous, and hence the people
were kept apart in small, isolated communities. There was no longer a
vigorous leader to resist the centrifugal tendencies imposed by petty
ambitions and jealousies; and only for ten years after Douchan’s death
did the external form of his empire last. As a barrier against the
Turkish conquerors in Europe the Servians proved utterly ineffective.With the Slavs eliminated the brunt of resistance naturally fell
upon the Greeks; but they were now only an emaciated remnant of
a great and long enduring empire that had worn out the Arab and
Saracen and had held the Slav at bay. After the fall of the Latin
rule at Constantinople (1261), the city became the capital of the
reconstructed Eastern Empire; but the scale of this restoration was
much reduced from its original grandeur. There were four groups of
imperial territories: the Asiatic possessions that had been controlled
from Nicæa, economically important as trade centers, but not great in
extent; in Europe, the capital and Thrace; some towns to the North,
such as Adrianople, a part of Macedonia, the peninsula of Gallipoli,
Chalcidice, and a part of Thessaly; certain islands in the Ægean,
Rhodes, Lesbos, Samothrace, Imbros, and the Peloponnesus in Greece.These possessions, the feeble remnants of the realm once ruled by Basil
the Macedonian, were surrounded by lands inhabited by numerous races.
There were the Frankish lands in Greece, the Venetians in the Ægean,
an independent Greek sovereignty in Epirus, Catalans in Thessaly,
Genoese in the Black and Ægean Seas, and the parts immediately adjacent
to Constantinople itself; the Seldjouk sultans at Iconium, and the
autonomous empire of Trebizond. There were also the Slavic peoples
in the Balkan peninsula, not to mention the more distant Christian
kingdoms of Armenia and Georgia.As a military power the revived Greek Empire was pathetically feeble.
Its last great leader in war was Michael VIII, who had retaken
Constantinople from the Latins, a conquest on a slight scale, since
the Latins were even weaker than their opponents. The measure of Greek
offensive is attested by the inability of any Greek Emperor to retake
the Asiatic provinces from the Turk, to annex the Empire of Trebizond,
to resist the Slavs in the Balkans, or to reoccupy the islands of the
Ægean and drive the Franks from Greece. Even in the interior there was
no effective administration. In every Greek city there were colonies of
Italian merchants, either Genoese or Venetian, who formed independent
communities under their own podestà. The army was filled with foreign
contingents, who were not even mercenary troops, because the Empire
could not afford to hire soldiers. They were auxiliary forces,
organized as complete military units under their own natural chief, and
were a constant menace. When they saw fit, they pillaged the country
and sometimes fought among themselves. They were under no kind of
control from the central or local authorities; within their own camps
on the frontiers, in the provinces, even under the walls of the capital
itself, they obeyed their own commanders and not the Emperor.One of the most radical changes for the worse in the revived Greek
Empire, a change that marked the contrast with the heroic period of
Byzantine military enterprise, was the lack of a fleet. For his naval
operations the Emperor depended on the Venetians or Genoese, a most
unsatisfactory arrangement, for, owing to the jealousy of these two
commercial states, if one were the ally of Constantinople, the other
was certain to be on the opposite side. In 1296 the Venetians, after
defeating their rivals at sea, laid siege to the Pera and Galata
sections of Constantinople, the seat of the Genoese colony, and in
setting fire to the quarter destroyed many Greek houses. Later on, the
Genoese revenged themselves by massacring the Venetian residents of
Constantinople.The anarchy was increased when, owing to rival claimants to the throne,
open civil war broke out, as it did frequently in the course of the
fourteenth century. Cantacuzene, an official in the imperial palace,
who became rival Emperor, while Anna of Saxony was regent during the
minority of her son, John V, after the death of his father, Andronicus
III, allied himself with the Servians and with the Seldjouk emir of
Konia. Anna tried to strengthen her side by calling upon Ourkhan, the
Osmanli Sultan. In the war that followed the Turks were authorized
to seize the citizens of the empire, and the rival governments placed
at the disposition of their Mohammedan allies seaports and vessels.
The captives taken were sent to Asia and sold as slaves in the Turkish
emirates.The various enemies of the Empire used this time of civil strife as
a favorable opportunity for seizing its territory. Stephen Douchan
conquered and annexed most of Macedonia, and, as their part of
the spoil, the Genoese acquired Chios and commenced a blockade of
Constantinople, the defense of which was intrusted to other Italians
under the command of Facciolati. This leader deserted the cause of the
regent Anna, and admitted Cantacuzene into the capital. An arrangement
was now patched up by which Cantacuzene was to be Emperor until John V
reached the age of twenty-five years.Even now Cantacuzene’s troubles as ruler were not over; his plan to
form an independent navy recruited from his own subjects and his desire
to do away with the commercial monopoly of the Genoese led to a war
of five years, 1348-1352. Cantacuzene’s Venetian allies were defeated
under the walls of Constantinople, with the result that the Greek
Emperor was obliged to make peace under most disadvantageous terms.
Not long after this disaster civil war broke out again. Souliman,
Ourkhan’s son, was a subsidized ally of Cantacuzene, and thousands of
the inhabitants of the Empire were deported by the Turks to be sold as
slaves.The lessons of these wars were not lost upon the Turkish auxiliaries
who were allowed to play such a conspicuous and decisive rôle by both
sides; they became acquainted with the country in which they had
served, knew its roads, cities, and inhabitants. All this information
was put to good use by them when they crossed the Bosphorus to fight
for their own interests and to dispossess their former employers at
Constantinople.From the point of view of its economic status the Empire was in no
condition to withstand an invasion. As territory was lost the proceeds
of direct taxation fell off; increases in the customs duties were
opposed and blocked by the Genoese and Venetians; the government lived
from hand to mouth. In 1306 when the Catalan mercenaries had to be
paid, Andronicus II put an end to the wheat monopoly exercised by the
Italians. Another characteristic expedient of this weak government
was the debasement of the coinage. But all the ordinary schemes for
raising money must have failed by the middle of the century, for we
find Anna of Saxony using the treasures of churches to pay for the
war against Cantacuzene. Indeed, her court had reached a condition
of extreme penury in 1347, when, at a coronation it was found that
the imperial jewels had disappeared. The splendid buildings of the
city were fast going to pieces. In Santa Sophia there were large
cracks, which necessitated the erection of two of the existing great
supporting buttresses that have enabled it to survive to our time
the frequent earthquakes that disturb the city. In the absence of a
centralized government the local administration lost all resemblance
to the admirably constructed system of the earlier period of Byzantine
rule when, as contrasted with Western Europe, it still preserved the
efficiency and smoothness of Roman governmental traditions. The local
authorities lived on the country, uncontrolled from Constantinople,
except irregularly and ineffectively.In reality, under the name of empire, all varieties of local
organizations existed side by side; some places were ruled by petty
tyrants, while others were municipal republics. In the important port
of Thessalonika, Italian precedents were closely followed. Here there
were four classes of citizens, the notables, the clergy, the bourgeois,
and in the lowest class the “populari.” Each class enjoyed complete
autonomy. They were organized in trade corporations, had their own
system of justice, and finally got supreme control of the town, turning
it into a democracy under the presidency of their metropolitan. When
Cantacuzene undertook to bring the rebels to reason, the archbishop,
in pleading the cause of the city-state, declared that his republic
was based on equality and justice, and said that its laws were better
than those of the Republic of Plato.There was another factor in this state of anarchy, to wit, the
religious dissensions, due to the willingness of some of the clergy
to accept union with the Papacy and to introduce Latin customs, an
attitude dating from the time of the Latin Empire. Apart from these
questions of ecclesiastical policy, there was much discussion of
theological subtilties concerning the existence of a supernatural
illumination in the soul, a controversy which divided the Church and
the imperial court. This trouble was settled by a synod, which decreed
that those espousing the new doctrine should be imprisoned.In a land so situated and so far fallen from its earlier estate, the
rapid conquests of the Osmanlis appear as due not so much to the valor
and intelligence of the adherents of Islam as to the inability of the
Christians to act or work together. The one security of the Empire was
the comparative weakness of the Turkish sea power. The Ottoman ships
were good enough for piratical expeditions, but there was no Turkish
fleet at all able to cope with the navies of Genoa or Venice.At the very beginning of Murad’s accession, a consistent plan of
attack was inaugurated, designed to cut off Constantinople from its
“hinterland”; the objective being the trade road between the capital
and Adrianople. Several of the important points on this line were
taken, Murad making his residence temporarily near Demotika. According
to Turkish custom, each spring brought a new expedition and a further
enlargement of the existing boundaries. The siege of Adrianople itself
soon began. (1360.) The Greek chronicles speak of its fall being due to
a betrayal of a secret path used by peasants inside the walls to get
to their fields. But the Turkish annals tell of an engagement between
the garrison and the Osmanli soldiers. In the city Murad took up his
residence, being attracted to it by its importance as a trading place
frequented by Venetians, Genoese, Florentines, and Catalans, as well
as by Turks and Greeks.Following soon the course of the river Maritza, on which Adrianople
stands, the Turkish invaders moved farther into the land until they
came to Philippopolis, which had been taken by the Bulgars not long
before. But the Slavs showed no greater capacity than the Greeks for
united action, and the town was taken from them without difficulty.
Other places were added, including Berrhœa on the Hæmus, and this whole
section of country for some time made up the northermost borders of
Ottoman dominion in Europe.In the south the same kind of successes took place; again a trade route
was selected, this time the road to Thessalonika, and a considerable
stretch of the territory through which it passed was annexed. In one
place the sea coast was reached at a point opposite the Island of
Samothrace. Murad returned now to Broussa, interrupting a farther
advance towards Trnova and Sofia, places in the hands of the Servians,
whose power in war he respected and feared more than that of their
allied race, the Bulgars.The menace caused by the Ottoman conquests was now being appreciated in
Western Europe, where, through the preaching of a crusade by Urban V, a
league was formed between Louis of Anjou, King of Hungary, and several
of the most powerful princes of the Balkan peninsula, both Roumanian
and Slav, for the purpose of driving out the Turks from their newly
acquired European possessions. With an army of 60,000 men the Christian
leaders reached the river Maritza, two days’ journey from Adrianople.
Murad was in Asia, besieging a Greek city on the Propontis, but he
was not needed, since a small detachment of the army of his general,
Lala-Schahin, came in contact with the Christians near Kermianon, and
put them to flight in a panic, in which the two Servian leaders lost
their lives. (1371.)This victory is set down in the Servian records as a great national
disaster, and deservedly so. It ended their resistance, and it handed
over to the Turks the rest of Thrace, Bulgaria, and a part of Servia.
Significant of the impression made by the conquest was the action of
the people of Ragusa, who signed a treaty of peace, inspired by a
desire to gain commercial advantages from the new Turkish conquests.
They agreed to pay an annual tribute of 500 golden ducats, and thus
they inaugurated a policy imitated by many of their stronger neighbors,
who preferred to make a good bargain with the Ottomans rather than try
the fortunes of war under the auspices of rival Christian states, whose
political aggrandizement, in case a victory were won over the infidel,
was dreaded even more than the expansion of an alien race.Yet the theory of a united Christendom was maintained despite its
pitiable outcome in the Balkans. Elsewhere there were brilliant feats
of arms, but they were isolated, and being directed by no consistent
plan, proved of no lasting advantage. Peter of Cyprus, a representative
of the Latin dynasty which had held the island since the days of the
earlier Crusades, regarded himself as the guardian of Christian hopes
in the Orient because of his titular dignity of King of Jerusalem. He
took Alexandria in 1365, and helped by Rhodes, Genoa, and contingents
sent by the Pope, he later took Satalieh (Attalia), a place situated in
one of the Seldjouk emirates. Some advantages were gained, too, on the
coast of Syria.There was little chance of permanent success so long as the princes
and states of the West with their divergent interests, dynastic or
commercial, confronted such a solidly compacted power as that raised
up by Osman. The Turks had a single aim, simple and direct, and they
kept hammering away at their enemies, putting in telling blows at the
right moment and the right place. On the other hand, the Christian
cause suffered both from the leadership of the Papacy, with its rigid
insistence on establishing Western ecclesiastical rule in the East, and
from the sordid self-seeking of the Genoese and Venetians. From both
points of view the conquest of the Greek Empire was generally regarded
as a necessary preliminary for making headway in the restoration of
Christian control over the Holy Land.The hard case of the Eastern Emperor, whose few remaining possessions
were in the fast-closing grip of the Ottoman Sultan, is sketched
indelibly in the narrative of the Western journey of John V, who, while
the Turks were absorbing the Slavic lands about his empire, visited
Rome to ask the Pope’s aid. In the desperate state of his resources he
had borrowed at Venice, at exorbitant rates of interest, money to pay
the expenses of his trip. On his return empty-handed he was stayed at
Venice by his creditors, and the republic put him in prison. His son,
Andronicus, associated with his father in the Empire, had been left
behind at Constantinople. When the Emperor appealed to him for aid,
the reply came that the treasury was empty. The unfortunate sovereign
appealed with more success to a younger son, Manuel, who mortgaged his
estates and enabled his father to return home.In May, 1372, the Pope again took the initiative in organizing an
anti-Ottoman league by writing to the Republic of Venice and the
King of Hungary a letter which described the achievements of the
“Saracens” in Thrace, their defeat of the “Servian lords in Greek
lands,” and the prospects of a farther advance of the infidel towards
the Adriatic. Bad news had come from Greece, too, of the possibility
of the Turkish invaders penetrating towards the south. A congress of
the Balkan states was called to meet at Thebes, a place under Frankish
and Roman Catholic rule; and it was a significant fact that no member
of the Eastern Church was asked to be present. A gathering of such a
restricted character could do nothing. There were at Thebes only a few
representatives of the small Latin principalities in Continental Greece
and the islands. Immediately after this gathering the Byzantine clergy
put forth in Constantinople a formal protest against the See of Rome
and appealed for help to the Knights of Rhodes.Peter of Cyprus had been murdered by his barons in 1369, and the island
had fallen into the hands of the Genoese. In 1374 the small Frankish
kingdom of Armenia, an enclave between the Turkish and Mongol lands in
Asia, had come to an end with the capture of Sis. In 1378 the great
church schism in the West brought about a situation that prevented
the Papacy from taking further thought for what was now left of the
Christian East. Four years later Louis of Hungary died, leaving his
kingdom, a land especially interested in preventing the extension of
Turkish power in Europe, a prey to a civil war induced by the division
he had made of his dominions between his two daughters. There was no
longer even the semblance of a chance that European forces would unite
on a large scale to resist the Turks. The contest was left to the
weak and divided efforts of the small Frankish states in Greece; to
the Bulgars and Servians in the Balkans, who followed only desultory,
haphazard methods, and to the Greeks of the Empire, who were living on
the traditions of a great past.Meanwhile, the Osmanlis were not disturbed by questions of religious
orthodoxy, and they were also spared the necessity of calling
congresses to decide the next step in their stealthy progress. In 1372,
under the personal supervision of Murad, expeditions were made by
which the whole of Roumelia to the Black Sea was not only made subject
to his rule, but Moslem families were settled in the conquered lands
and a regularly ordered system of local military government provided.
Then came the turn of the few remaining provinces still held by the
Greek Emperor. When Vizya (in Turkish, Wissa), an important city,
fell into Murad’s hands, John, whose bitter necessities had forced
him to pay tribute to the Turk and even to furnish a contingent for
military service, tried to recover his lost city. A punitive expedition
appeared in consequence near Constantinople, and some strong castles
were annexed; but nothing near the sea coast was taken, for the Sultan
had no desire to bring down upon himself the ill will of the Venetians
and other Italians, who would not tolerate any interference in their
control of the important waterways near Constantinople. For the same
reason, though constant additions were being made to Turkish territory
close to Thessalonika, no attempt was made to close in on the city for
fear of complications with the Latin powers, complications which might
excite such an outbreak of the crusading ardor that the Italian navies
might be used.Considerably more important were the operations of the Sultan’s
lieutenant, Lala-Schahin. There were internal dissensions between the
Bulgars and the Roumanian Layko, a feudatory of the King of Hungary.
Allying himself with Layko, Lala-Schahin succeeded in capturing Sofia,
and for a while even Nisch was occupied. No attempt was as yet made by
the Slavs after their earlier defeat to protect themselves on a large
scale. At this point the method and aim of the pacific penetration
policy of the Sultan, which alternated with carefully devised methods
of military aggression, can be seen in the picturesque story of the
plot entered into by Andronicus, the son of John the Emperor, and
Sandschi, the son of Murad, to take the lives and the crowns of their
respective fathers. The conspiracy was detected and defeated, and
the young Turkish prince died from the effect of having hot vinegar
poured in his eyes. Andronicus, escaping from his prison, after the
common Byzantine penalty of blinding his sight had been, perhaps
intentionally, inflicted with such mildness that he regained it, made
a treaty with the Genoese and with Murad. He agreed to confer special
privileges on the Turks if they would help to secure for him the
imperial crown. For three years the usurpation lasted, and John and
his faithful son Manuel were only restored to their rights by Murad’s
friendly connivance, which was secured by the promise of 3000 ducats a
year. Of less value must have been the additional agreement that the
Byzantine princes would serve in the Sultan’s army.Andronicus had fled to the Turkish lines and, through the intervention
of Murad, he received later Thessalonika as an appanage. He was
aided by the Genoese, while his father had as allies the Venetians,
a division of interests out of which grew the celebrated naval war,
called that of Chioggia, between the two rival cities of Italy. Murad
preferred to keep quiet while the two Italian naval powers were in
force in his neighborhood, and he devoted himself with much sagacity to
fishing in the troubled waters of the Asiatic emirates, with results
both in war and diplomacy that were eminently satisfactory.In 1387 after there had been such successes of the Turks to record
as the surrender of Monastir, and Prilep, and Schtip, and even the
temporary seizure of Thessalonika, the Servians undertook, under the
direction of a feudal lord, Lazar, to organize a systematic plan of
resistance. Lazar was first aided by a Bosnian king, Tourtko, who had,
however, ambitious designs on certain lands under the Hungarian crown,
designs that soon robbed his promised co-operation of its influence.
Schischman of Bulgaria was drawn into the league, and in Lazar’s army
there appeared also contingents of Albanians and Roumanians standing
side by side with the Slavs. The crisis was fully appreciated by Murad.
He summoned new troops from Asia, and all the greatest generals took
part in the campaign, in addition to his two sons, Bajesid and Jakab.
The decisive battle was fought on ground that was part of Lazar’s own
domains near Prischtina, on the wide plains called Kossowopolje. Murad
was surrounded by his band of Janitschars; to hold back the enemy the
camels of the Asiatic troops were drawn up in front. The Christians
were confident in their superior number, for they had 200,000 men under
arms ready to begin the attack.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'From a contemporary account comes the narrative of the death of the
Sultan. It is there told how ten young men of distinguished birth,
bound by oath to stand by one another, succeeded in forcing their
way to the tent of Murad. One of these, Mulasch Obilitsch, managed
to inflict two fatal wounds on the neck and body of the aged ruler.
But this successful stroke did not end the fight, for Bajesid, who
was renowned for the rapidity and daring of his generalship, drove
his wing of the Ottoman army into the Christian ranks, broke through
them, and put them to flight at the very moment they thought themselves
victorious. It is said that in the panic Lazar lost his life; probably
he was captured and subsequently sacrificed in revenge for the murder
of Murad. (June 15, 1389.)Both armies withdrew after the battle. Murad’s fate made him a martyr
to the faith, and he is one of the Sahibs or Elect of Islam. Even the
Greeks praise his character as being benevolent towards the conquered,
whom he understood how to win over to his side after he had conquered
them by the irresistible force of his arms. He laid the foundations
of the Moslem state, adapting it shrewdly for rule over conquered
populations. They were accepted as tenants of the new owners of the
soil, paying tithes. The Sultan himself received the Kharadsch or
tribute money. At the same time the subject races retained their faith,
their customs, their church, their courts, and their aristocracy. The
warrior class was made up of native Turks and some renegades. These
became the sole owners of the land and had to take their place in
the regular yearly campaigns. There was, besides, a standing army of
young foot soldiers composed of captives taken in war, the Janitschar
class, who looked up to the Sultan as their father. For administrative
progress there was a corps of officials, whose functions descended
from father to son, composed of “Begs.” At the top of this bureaucracy
was a Beglerbeg for each half of the kingdom, one for Asia and one for
Europe, and a Wesir or Pascha, the equivalent in Turkish of the former
word, which is Arabic. The administrative divisions under the Begs
were called Sandjaks (flags) because these were carried by the Begs as
emblems of their authority.The battle of Kossovo, in which both opposing armies lost their
leaders, became in Servian folklore and poetry a source of inspiration
of the kind that among Romance peoples gathers about the defeat
of Charles the Great in the Pyrenees and the death of Roland. The
incidents of the heroic theme take up the tragedy of the battle; Slavic
improvisers sing of the death of Lazar, of his father-in-law, the
aged King, and his nine brothers-in-law. Mulasch, the slayer of Murad,
who met his death in the flight, is not passed over, nor the 12,000
infidels who perished. Like Murad, Lazar, the “Servian crown of gold,”
is celebrated as a martyr of his faith, a hero who went voluntarily to
his death. The legend tells how St. Elias, in the form of a falcon,
came from the Holy City of Jerusalem, bringing him a letter from the
Mother of God, in which he was offered the choice of the heavenly
empire or dominion over the earth. Lazar made the choice which gave him
the spiritual kingdom.
III BAJESID
The first act of Bajesid’s accession was the murder of his younger
brother, whom he summoned to his presence and caused to be strangled.
This deed left Bajesid the sole representative of the house of Osman;
there was no rival now for him to fear. He wished to stand alone as
creator of his own statecraft, for he refused to respect any of the
arrangements or conventions made by Murad. His own ideal was foreign to
the loose feudalized system previously established; he desired to clear
away all the dependent dynasties, and to substitute for them officers
of his own, directly controlled by him.The first important military operation of the new reign was directed
against Mircea, a Roumanian lord, who had seized and occupied
Nicopolis, lately surrendered to Ali-Pascha, Murad’s vizier, by
Schischman, before the battle of Kossovo. All the vassals were called
under arms to follow the Sultan, who crossed the Danube to where Mircea
was awaiting his attack in a position difficult of access on account of
roads and swamps. No details of the fight are given, but Bajesid was
the victor. (October 10, 1394.) Mircea fled to the Carpathians.As one result of their victory the Turks left Bucharest in the hands
of an Ottoman garrison under the direction of a Roumanian Boyar Vlad,
who was appointed to take the place of Mircea, because of the latter’s
failure to perform the obligations of a faithful vassal, though he had
met with generous treatment from Bajesid after the battle of Kossovo.
He was not present at the battle itself, but rendered himself liable
to punishment by sending armed contingents of his own men to help
the Christian cause. He had been captured and exiled to Broussa; but
he was released on condition of paying a small tribute, and retained
his right of sovereignty over his subjects. More remarkable still,
Bajesid had undertaken not to permit any Turks to establish themselves
in Wallachia, or to found mosques in Mircea’s country. By presuming
on this favorable and exceptional treatment, Mircea again had brought
himself into the status of an exile.Sigismund of Hungary saw the necessity of helping his unfortunate
neighbor Mircea with the Turks so close at hand. Moreover, the
Hungarian ruler’s relations with Western Europe, through his connection
with the house of Luxembourg, and his inheritance from Prince Louis of
Anjou, placed him in a good position to appeal to the warlike lords
and knights of France to aid him against infidel aggression. He turned
also to the Republic of Venice as a partner in the undertaking, but the
prudent merchants of that commonwealth showed no immediate interest in
the projected crusade.The movement initiated from Hungary put heart into the Byzantines, who,
because of the change from the mild Murad to the relentless Bajesid,
were now hard pressed in the small corner of territory still left them.
There was moral depression as well, for Manuel II, when made co-Emperor
with his aged father John, had been obliged to accompany the Sultan
in all his campaigns with a contingent. This obligation revealed the
desperate straits of the Greek Empire, especially as the contingent
numbered only a hundred men. One Greek city, Philadelphia, the single
imperial possession in Asia Minor, had been attacked by Bajesid because
the citizens refused to receive a Turkish garrison, though John had
previously agreed to surrender it to Murad. Among the other vassals
who were called to take part in this campaign were Stephen, Prince of
the Servians, and Manuel, the Byzantine Emperor. As a further sign of
dependence on the Sultan’s will, who seemed bent on devising schemes to
humiliate the miserable Greek prince, Manuel had been forced to help
to repair the fortifications of Gallipoli, and also to coöperate with
the Turks in their preparations to send expeditions to Attica and some
of the islands of the Ægean. When John V began to restore some of the
ruined fortifications around the imperial city, Bajesid ordered him to
desist, threatening, if the command were not obeyed, to deprive Manuel
of his sight, for the heir, and co-Emperor, was, as usual, doing duty
as a vassal in one of the Turkish military expeditions.On the death of John V, in 1391, Manuel was allowed to succeed to the
title, and, officially, good relations were observed between the Sultan
and the ruler of Constantinople. Bajesid, however, had no intention of
permitting Manuel, whom he knew to be a man of ability and decision,
to gain any new ground. The few places contiguous to Constantinople,
over which the Greeks still ruled, were constantly being harassed
by Ottoman aggressions. Manuel was really being besieged in his own
capital. His constant appeals for help were made in vain; the Venetians
found it commercially more advantageous to draw closer to the Osmanlis,
especially since Bajesid, by absorbing various emirates in Asia Minor,
was in control of important trading towns on that coast. A treaty was
concluded between the two powers, and the Venetians went so far as to
deny their help to the Frankish lords of the Ægean, and were preparing
to weaken continental Greece by efforts to gain territory in that
quarter at the expense of the Greek master of the Morea, a son of the
Emperor.While Sigismund was seeking allies in the West against the Turks, and
Bajesid was elaborating plans for an invasion of the whole country
south of his European holdings, Thessalonika was retaken from the
Greeks. Without much difficulty Turkish troops in a raid westward
penetrated into the Morea, or Peloponnesus, itself, though a wall had
been built by the Venetians across the Isthmus. No permanent settlement
was made, but still the country suffered, for many of the inhabitants
were sold, and, during the course of the expedition, many cities of
Greece experienced, for the first time, the barbarism of a Turkish
invasion. This expedition to the south was like so many others under
the command of the local “Begs,” because Bajesid himself was bent on
completing the conquest of Bulgaria. After a long siege Tirnovo was
taken by assault; its churches were sacked, and it was, in general,
made an example by the ruthless conqueror. Even the dead were left
unburied. Along with a multitude of prisoners, the Bulgarian Patriarch
was taken to Asia. As to Sischman, he is reputed to have died, either
on the battlefield or in captivity; his capital, which had been the
residence of the Bulgar Tsars since 1200, sank to the level of a
small market town, though once it had been famous for its beautiful
buildings, constructed to rival or imitate those of Constantinople.
Bulgaria, already a poor fragment of its original extent after the
first stage of the invasion, now ceased altogether to exist as a Slav
state.At this disastrous conjuncture for the Christian cause (1394),
Sigismund of Hungary intervened by sending representatives to Bajesid
to ask by what right he had destroyed Bulgaria. As an answer to the
delegation, Bajesid is said to have shown the bows and arrows which
decorated the hall of audience. Long anticipating the warlike aims
of the Hungarian King, Bajesid made ready to complete the siege of
Constantinople, and so to prevent any coöperation between the Greeks
and the Christian power farther north. Sigismund, who, as we have
mentioned, had relied on his influence in the West to get aid adequate
to the undertaking he had in hand, now knew that his embassy which
had visited France had been well received by the King, Charles VI, and
his great nobles, many of whom had agreed to take up arms. As head of
the expedition, John the Fearless, son of the Duke of Burgundy, had
been selected; there were gathered round him many well-known lords as
counselors, and a contingent of 10,000 men, foot and horse. Besides
these, there were contingents of knights from Germany, Luxembourg,
England, Switzerland, and the Low Countries. Even Venice was induced
to supply galleys and money for the cause. The Knights of Rhodes sent
their fleet and their Grand Master with it. The Slavs of Poland and the
Roumanians also joined the crusade. Even Manuel took heart and promised
to keep some of the Turkish army occupied by making an offensive
movement.In July, 1396, the various contingents from the Occident met the
Hungarian and Roumanian armies at Bada. Mircea, who had had personal
experience with the Turkish military power, advised, with the wisdom
that comes from defeat, a policy of defensive action, that the allies
should wait for Bajesid’s advance into Hungary. But this dilatory
program was not acceptable to the Western knights, who declared that
they were there to fight, not to waste time in the inaction of a camp.
Accordingly the army went down the Danube to Ossovo, and the river was
crossed near the so-called Iron Gates.After winning some initial successes in a land where only the garrisons
were Turkish, the crusaders, on September 12, reached Nicopolis, a
place well fortified and strongly held by a veteran Ottoman general,
Dogon-beg, who commanded a garrison of seasoned troops. At first the
French knights tried to take the place by storm; but there were not
enough ladders. It was, therefore, resolved to starve it out. The siege
was in progress when Bajesid arrived from Constantinople. When he heard
of the danger of his general he burnt his siege machines and hastened
to Nicopolis. The crusaders would not at first believe that the Sultan
was marching upon them; those who first reported the news in the camp
were treated as spies and had their ears cut off. When it was found to
be true, the Christians massacred the prisoners already taken.In preparing for the battle there was a fatal diversity of views.
Sigismund wished to put Mircea’s men in the first line, since they
were not regarded as good warlike material; next to this division he
wished to station the Hungarians, and then, as the chief support of the
whole, the knights from the West. But the French would hear nothing of
this plan, which they regarded as equivalent to an insult; the place
in front belonged, they thought, to them by right. A few of the most
experienced counselors of John of Burgundy agreed with Sigismund, but
nothing could be done to persuade the mass of the French warriors to
give way. In the Ottoman army there were no differences of opinion;
the Sultan’s vassals were answerable to his command, and, it is to be
noted, that Stephen, the young Servian despot, with a contingent of
trained warriors, fought for Bajesid against the crusaders. But with
this exception the Sultan’s army, in all reckoned at 110,000, was
composed of Moslem troops. Out of the 110,000 ranged on the other side,
there were about 20,000 crusaders, of whom 16,000 were French. These,
with the bravado that came from the traditions of western chivalry,
undertook to bear the brunt of the fighting. Sigismund again tried to
secure the adoption of his more cautious plan, but without result. The
constable of France, Count d’Eu, gave the signal to advance, and the
French knights moved to the onslaught with cries of “Vive St. Denis,
Vive St. George.” Sigismund’s army, composed of trusty Transylvanians,
Hungarians, and Tschechs, was in the center, and on the right wing
behind the crusaders, while Mircea’s men made up the left. The Turks
were drawn up in three lines; in the first were irregular troops,
“akindji” and “azabs,” and a body of mercenaries; in the second Asiatic
foot soldiers flanked by two squadrons of “spahis”; behind were
stationed what might be called the guard regiments, the Janitschars and
the spahis of the Porte; a short distance away in individual formation
stood the 5000 Servians under Stephen.In their reckless dash forward the knights carried everything before
them, the irregulars first, and Janitschars afterwards, though these
were protected by a line of inclined pointed stakes. The horsemen
had no difficulty in leaping over these obstacles, and made fearful
execution with their swords on the Turks in the level plain. But,
while the French were driving through their enemies in front like a
flying wedge, the Turks on the two wings were reforming to make an
inclosing movement around the knights. As these could not withdraw,
they continued the charge right into the second line of Bajesid, where
they put “hors de combat” five thousand Turks. But by this time both
men and horses were exhausted, and the ranks were broken. The more
cautious leaders advised Count d’Eu to fall back on the Hungarians for
support, but he gave orders to renew the charge. The third line of the
enemy could not, however, be broken; the Western crusaders were being
overwhelmed by fresh bodies of Ottomans.The Frenchmen might have been aided easily by their allies behind them,
but at this moment Mircea, with his Wallachians and the Transylvanian
contingent, suddenly deserted the field. This cowardly action threw
the rest of the army into a panic. Soon Sigismund was left with but a
fraction of his army, the men from the Christian lands in the East lent
no aid, nor did they stand their ground. The Hungarian King advanced
to rescue the Western crusaders, but a charge made by the Servians,
who had as yet kept out of the battle, prevented the union of the now
separated portions of the Christian army. The French, though left
alone, performed great feats of arms, fighting, as the chronicles
say, like mad wolves and frothing boars. Gathering together in small
groups of eight or ten, the knights, using their long swords, fortified
themselves behind the heaps of dead and wounded Turks. It was told
how the standard of the Virgin, defended by John de Vienne and his
companions, was six times struck to the ground, only to be proudly
lifted again until the heroic Frenchman himself fell, still clasping in
his arms the tattered standard. Sigismund also fought desperately, but
there was no escape except by retreating northward to the Danube, where
the galleys of Rhodes and Venice took on board what was left of the
great army of the crusaders.The splendid equipment of the Western knights furnished Bajesid with
immense spoil; but it was a dear victory. From thirty to forty thousand
of his men lay dead on the field, as a witness to the prowess of French
chivalry. Wherever the French fought, the chronicles record that “for
one Christian of those who lay dead on the field, there were thirty
Turks or more, or other men of that faith.” Maddened by his losses,
the Sultan ordered his prisoners to be killed. The massacre went on
all day; 2000 were executed; only those escaped who were likely to be
ransomed for large sums, and a few prisoners whose age was less than
twenty years. It was the soldiers’ greed rather than the Sultan’s
clemency which brought the butchery to an end.When the news of the defeat was received at Paris, there was universal
mourning. Then an embassy was sent, with rich presents for the
Sultan, to arrange the ransom of the prisoners. The amount settled
upon was 200,000 florins. The Western ambassadors were treated with
great courtesy and magnificent entertainments were provided for their
amusement. In parting from one of the distinguished captives, John the
Fearless, son of the Duke of Burgundy, Bajesid said, “I do not wish to
require from you the oath not to bear arms against me again; if, when
you return home, you still find yourself in the humor for fighting me,
you will find me always ready to meet you on the field of battle, for
I am born for war and conquest.” As presents for Charles VI of France,
in exchange for those that had been sent him, he despatched by the
French envoys various warlike accouterments, among others a drum and
bowstrings, made of human flesh.The fancifulness of the Turk was also seen by his sending with
those who made the formal announcement of his victory to the Moslem
princes of Asia and Egypt, the Western prisoners all equipped in their
heavy armor to enable the leaders of his own faith to understand the
significance of his success. As a result of the battle of Nicopolis,
Bosnia, Bulgaria, and Roumania accepted Ottoman rule; at the same time
the adjoining lands of the Hungarian King became the field of Turkish
raids.Constantinople was in a perilous situation, but an attempt to take it
failed (1398). Less fortunate, as has been seen, were the inhabitants
of continental Greece, who saw Argos taken, and the country of the
Peloponnesus ravaged by Bajesid. The troubles of the imperial city were
not relieved by Bajesid’s failure to capture it, for by the instigation
of the Turks, John, the nephew of Manuel, became a claimant for the
crown, and at the head of 10,000 Ottoman troops marched on the city.
The result was that Manuel agreed to take his nephew as associate in
the Empire, a term which now had only a technical significance, for the
imperial dignity meant little more than the rule over Constantinople
itself. Bajesid refused to allow this arrangement unless further
concessions were made, such as the establishment of a fourth mosque
in the city, and the same local autonomy for the Turkish colony as
that enjoyed by the Venetians and Genoese. Manuel refused and appealed
to Western Christendom. France again showed its sympathy by sending
a survivor of the Nicopolis campaign, a knight, Boucicout, who, with
only 1200 men, forced the entrance of the Dardanelles, and afterwards
won a minor success in Asia, though he failed in his attempt to take
Nicodemia. Manuel tried, as his father had done, a personal visit to
the West, and remained nearly two years in France. Bajesid, in the
meantime, was encircling Constantinople with his fleet and armies, when
the situation suddenly changed, owing to the expansion of a new power
in the Orient.The emirates of those Seldjouks, who had survived absorption by the
Ottomans, had, at the close of the fourteenth century, formed a
defensive alliance against Bajesid, but they were not successful.
The Sultan seized their best provinces, and, when they resorted to
arms, defeated the Seldjoukian emirs on the battlefield. Gradually
the Ottoman dominions were approaching the Euphrates, by which they
were brought near the frontier of the newly-organized Mongol empire,
the creation of the great conqueror Timur. The growth of bad feeling
between the two rival powers was accentuated, when each sovereign began
to receive with favor the rebellious vassals of the other. Timur sent
to the Sultan a threatening letter, which was answered in the temper
in which it was couched. Timur’s reply was to cross the frontier, and
this step was followed up by the capture of the important town of
Sivas. All the inhabitants were massacred, the Christians in it being
burned alive, and the governor of the place, a son of the Sultan, was
strangled. Timur turned from his invasion of the south to attack Angora
with the purpose of drawing the Turks into a trap. He succeeded, for
he had between two and three hundred thousand men, while Bajesid,
to oppose him, had only 120,000. A great battle took place on July
20, 1402, which ended most disastrously for the Turks, because the
Seldjoukians went over to the enemy. Bajesid was captured, and two of
his sons were killed. Much of the land to the west was overrun by the
Mongols, but a permanent organization of the Mongol Empire was made
impossible because of the death of Timur on February 19, 1405. Bajesid
had also died of a broken heart, after his terrible defeat.
IV MURAD II
This change of fortune meant much for the Greek Empire. Manuel took
courage, deprived the Turks of their privileges at Constantinople, and
making use of the divisions among the successors of Bajesid, succeeded
in regaining a part of the territories that had been lost. For some
years the Ottomans, under Mohammed, were engaged in regaining their
position in Asia; in Europe the tables were reversed. The empire of
the Ottomans seemed to be on the point of going through a process of
disintegration similar to that experienced by their predecessors of the
same race, the Seldjouks. When it was defunct its residuary legatee
might well be the Greek Empire.There were now many Ottoman princes, no longer one sultan. Souliman,
who reigned at Adrianople, sought the protection of Manuel, gave him as
a hostage one of his sisters, married a niece of the Emperor, restored
part of Macedonia and Ionia, and yielded up Thessalonika, the greatest
prize of all. When he was succeeded by his brother Mousa, there was an
outbreak of hostilities; Thessalonika was again lost by the Greeks, but
soon retaken, while a Turkish fleet was resisted by a fleet now manned
by Greek sailors; for Manuel had taken care to provide for a navy, and
was no longer dependent on the commercial cities of Italy. Mohammed
was summoned by Manuel from Asia as an ally against Mousa, and the two
succeeded in defeating him. On his capture he met death at Mohammed’s
hands.For the next eight years (1413-1421) Mohammed was sole ruler of the
Osmanlis, but internal difficulties hindered aggressive action on his
part, so far as the Christian powers were concerned. His policy was
decidedly philhellenic, Manuel receiving from his hands important
territories on the Black Sea and the Propontis; but his main attention
was directed to the Asiatic provinces, where, in addition to troubles
with the emir of Karamania, there were disturbances, due to religious
agitations in Islam. One of the chief agitators was a converted Jew,
Torlak-Hin-Kemali, a preacher of the revolutionary doctrines of liberty
and equality, who demanded a division of property. This communistic
teaching stirred up the masses of the people, and excited the active
sympathy of the dervish party.On the death of Mohammed, his son, Murad II, took up the succession.
He was a prince of energy and ability, who devoted himself for thirty
years to the restoration of the Empire. The Greek Emperor Manuel still
carried on his policy of sowing dissension among the Turks, but with
less success than in the preceding period. Mustafa, an uncle of the new
Sultan, became the ally of the Greeks, and Gallipoli, the first place
taken by the Turks in Europe, was besieged. Murad hastened personally
to save the town from capture. His uncle was taken, beaten, and hanged.
Murad undertook then to lay siege to Constantinople, this making the
fourth time that the city had been threatened by Ottoman armies. (June,
1422.)The besiegers were a motley host; mixed with the soldiers were
dervishes, marabouts (religious teachers), artisans, and peasants, all
drawn together by the hope of sacking the rich capital.They showed much improvement in the siege-methods employed, for
they used wooden towers, and tried to get into the city through the
aqueduct. The Greek armies were beaten in front of the walls, but
Manuel and his son, John, soon found a way for causing the withdrawal
of Murad’s army, by inviting over from Asia another son of Mohammed,
to whom his brother had intrusted the government of one of the Asiatic
provinces. He was ceremoniously received in the city, and as soon as it
was known in the Turkish camp that he was on his way to the west, Murad
withdrew to Adrianople.This siege is signalized in the chronicles by a narrative of the
miraculous appearance of the Virgin on the walls of the city, the very
day a general assault had been ordered. The Ottomans, panic-stricken,
it is said, hastened to retreat. Both Christians and Mohammedans
accepted the authenticity of the apparition, which is not surprising,
since, in the ranks of the Sultan’s army, there were large numbers of
men who had been converted to Islam, but who could not throw aside the
religious habits of mind of medieval Christians.Peace was made on conditions extremely favorable to the Greeks. There
was still a tribute to be paid, but some territory that had been taken
in the campaign was restored. When Manuel died in 1425 he left six
sons, all of whom were in positions of command. One of them, John VIII,
was his successor as Emperor, the others were ruling parts of the
empire at Thessalonika and farther south.One of the first acts of the new administration was to endeavor to
placate the Turks by restoring some of the towns on the Black Sea. But
the efforts at pacification were of no avail. The Morea was invaded by
one of the Sultan’s generals, Tourakhan-beg, whose progress was not
effectively contested, except by the Albanian colonies. The inhabitants
of these were, however, mercilessly slaughtered, and on the site of the
razed towns the Turks erected pyramids of the heads of their victims.
In the north, too, there was successful fighting on the part of the
Ottomans, both with the Roumanians and the Bulgarians, and even with
the Hungarians, whose King, Sigismund, was defeated near the walls of
Kolunbitz.In 1430, Murad took charge of the attack on Thessalonika, now in the
possession of the Venetians, who had taken it from the Greek prince
Andronicus. The activity of Venice at this time is in decided contrast
to the cautious policy displayed by the republic in the previous
century. For one thing, the secular contest with Genoa had been
decided in favor of the Adriatic port. Then, too, the objections of
the Venetians to occupy continental possessions had been overcome by
the exigencies of Italian politics, which had forced Venice to play a
larger rôle in advancing her especial interests than ever before. It
seemed for a time as if the Venetians would become the natural heirs
to the territories of the Eastern Empire in the lands of peninsular
Greece, while to the north Hungary had risen to be the main power,
around which the Roumanian and Slavic races gathered as their natural
protector against the Turk. From now on the establishment of the
Ottoman power in Europe would depend on the overthrow of both the
Venetians and the Hungarians. The former, as has just been intimated,
were slowly and diplomatically acquiring Greek principalities in the
south of continental Greece, but were striving, at the same time, not
to bear the brunt of Turkish hostility. They relied partly on the
strong fleet which had been sent to the East, and partly on the care
they had taken to secure the aid of the Hungarians. On the other hand,
the Turks had been developing their navy, and they ventured, as early
as 1428, to attack merchant vessels belonging to the republic.The fall of Thessalonika precipitated events and caused the Venetians
to recognize that quick action was necessary. The republic entered into
relations with the King of Cyprus and with the dissatisfied vassal
princes of Karamania, who were ever ready to rebel against the Sultan.
Proposals were made to King Sigismund to inaugurate a new crusade, in
which he would have charge of the land forces, while the Venetians,
keeping the mastery of the sea, would prevent new troops from being
sent over from Asia. Unhappily, Sigismund proved apathetic; there were
disturbances in the Albanian lands owned by Venice, and a war with
Genoa kept the Venetians from having a free hand to deal effectively
with the Sultan. Accordingly, a peace was patched up, by the terms
of which Venice paid a tribute to the Turks for some of her Greek
possessions.Plundering expeditions were now made by the Turks into Hungarian
territory, but before Sigismund could undertake military operations
on his side his death occurred. (December 9, 1437.) The work of
defense was then undertaken by his successor and son-in-law, Albert.
For the first time the Sultan in person led an army in the region of
the Carpathians and the Danube, and, although a coalition was formed,
consisting of Hungarians, Servians, and Wallachians, the Turkish arms
proved, as so often, irresistible. Semendria was taken, and many
thousands of prisoners were carried away from the ravaged countries.
But Belgrade held out, though Albert died there among his troops on
October 27, 1438.Strong hands were found ready to take up the work of defense. In the
city, which was amply protected by a threefold wall, and by many pieces
of artillery mounted on the ramparts, there was a garrison of German
mercenaries, while in other regions exposed to the invaders, there were
Hungarian forces under the command of Johann Hunyadi, the son of a
Roumanian peasant of Inidora, whose reputation as a national hero was
soon to be made in the victorious leadership of his people against the
Turk.Hunyadi’s first aggressive act was an invasion into Bosnia, where he
drove out some marauding bands of the Turkish general Isa-beg. A much
more important military exploit was the battle of Szt-Imre, where, in
1442 (March 18), the Turks were forced back into Wallachia. Attempts
made somewhat later to avenge this humiliation had no final success,
for Hunyadi attacked the invading army on its march, winning a victory
conspicuous because many well-known Ottoman generals lost their lives.Spurred by the prowess of Hunyadi, the Western powers prepared to
support him in driving the Ottomans from Europe. There was additional
ground for hope in the arrangements, lately made, for a union between
the Eastern and Western churches, a scheme naturally regarded as a
good basis for coöperation against the Moslems. A new crusade was
proclaimed, but nothing was accomplished by it, since the Venetians
feared the loss of their possessions in the East, if the Slavic races
were too actively aided, and since the Pope had no inclination to part
with the tithes collected for the crusade, while he had use for them in
protecting his temporal sovereignty as an Italian prince.The Hungarians, left for these sinister reasons to deal with the Turks
single-handed, displayed no lack of resolution. Hunyadi, with troops
of Roumanians and Hungarians, passed the Danube late in October,
1443. He soon occupied Nisch and defeated several Ottoman armies, but
the campaign had no decisive result, for Hunyadi feared to penetrate
farther into Turkish territory without additional forces, especially
as Murad was now in personal command. This caution was justified, for,
in withdrawing, the Christian army suffered a reverse. The Hungarians
could congratulate themselves that their advance had given great
encouragement wherever the pressure of the Turkish occupation was felt.
Yet there was no sincere effort on the part of the Christian powers to
work together. The Servians made their own terms with the Sultan, and
the Venetian fleet, ostensibly despatched to eastern waters to act with
the Hungarians, was put under the command of Loredano, who had private
instructions to come to terms with the Turks.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'The story of a peace concluded on terms most humiliating for Murad,
by which, among other things, the whole of Bulgaria and Servia was
evacuated, is rightly questioned. All that is known is that Wladislaw,
who was now King of Hungary (1440), solemnly protested that he would
undertake a crusade against the Turks, all treaties and truces to
the contrary notwithstanding. The expedition was begun, Hunyadi
coöperating, and Papal legates testifying, by their presence, that a
true crusade was in progress. But, although the army stood for the
cause of the whole of Christendom, in the ranks there were almost none
but Hungarian soldiers. It crossed the Danube, intending to march
straight to Varna, and from there proceed by sea to Constantinople.
But it was far too small for the work it planned to do; even after it
had been joined by Vlad of Wallachia, it only numbered 15,000 men.
Before Varna could be taken, Murad (at the head of an army of 40,000
men) hastened from Asia to arrest the progress of the crusaders. In the
engagement that followed all efforts to break through the Janitschars,
even when attempted under the experienced leadership of Hunyadi, failed
completely, and the Christians suffered a decisive overthrow. Only a
few of the 15,000 escaped, among them Hunyadi and Vlad. Among the dead
were the King of Hungary and a Papal legate. (October, 1444.)The news of this disaster took some time to reach the West, and by
the time it was known there, information was also received that the
indefatigable Hunyadi was again girding himself up for a second
expedition. This ended with some small advantages in Wallachia. Again,
in 1448, he tried another mode of entrance into the Sultan’s territory,
passing this time among the Albanians, on whose aid he reckoned without
avail, since they were fighting on their own account against the
Turks. The Servians, too, held aloof. The second battle of Kossovo
(October 17, 1448) ended in a defeat for the Hungarians, although the
Turkish losses were very severe. Under the hammering of Hunyadi, the
Janitschars were obliged to give way, but they withdrew in good order
with unbroken ranks.There was a truce for three years after this battle, much to the
relief of both sides, since Murad had encountered an aggressive
Albanian leader in Scanderbeg, who seemed likely to rival Hunyadi as
an enemy of Ottoman rule. For some time this Albanian champion, whose
name in Albanian is equivalent to Alexander, had been kept as a page
at the Sultan’s court. During the confusion caused by the campaigns
of Hunyadi, the young man had managed to escape, but before doing
so, he had forced the Sultan’s secretary, under menace of death, to
sign an order directing the commander of Croia to give up the place
to Scanderbeg. On reaching his home in the mountains, the Albanian
chieftain put himself at the head of 600 warriors. Entering Croia alone
he presented his written order to the governor, who immediately turned
over the place to him. In the night he brought his men into the town
and the Turkish garrison was massacred.Everywhere throughout the land the Albanian people rose to cast out
the Turk from their borders. Scanderbeg soon had 11,000 men under him,
and won back all the possessions belonging to his family. Even the
Venetians, who had tried to seize an Albanian town, were glad to come
to terms with him, and to become his financial agents. He was accepted
as chief of all the forces operating against the Ottomans, and a relief
expedition of 40,000 men, under the command of Ali Pascha, the vizier,
was caught in the fastnesses of the Albanian mountains and slowly
exterminated. (1443.) Another Turkish army fared no better than that
under Ali Pascha, and it lost 10,000 men. When Murad himself undertook
to repress the rebellion, bringing with him the overwhelming force of
100,000 men, he took two cities, but left 20,000 of his men dead in
the narrow defiles of Albania. Two years afterwards Murad began the
siege of Croia, trusting to specially powerful artillery to overwhelm
the enemy. But Scanderbeg, by skilful manœuvers, not only held the
Sultan in check, but actually enveloped his army. Murad, seeing his
danger, offered peace, on condition that Scanderbeg would acknowledge
his sovereignty, and pay tribute to him. This was refused, and Murad
abandoned his efforts to arrest the stubborn guerrilla warfare in which
the Albanian chieftain had proved himself a master.In the Morea, where the Byzantine princes, the sons of Manuel II, were
gaining ground at the expense of one of the Latin feudal lords, the
Florentine Acciajuoli, who had accepted the Sultan as his overlord,
Murad’s army of 60,000 men achieved decisive successes. The wall
across the Isthmus of Corinth was taken by the Ottoman artillery, and
the Peloponnesus was overrun by the invaders. Corinth was seized and
burnt; but Patras, by its stout resistance, held the Sultan in check
until terms were made, by which the invaders withdrew, on condition of
receiving an annual tribute. (1446.)But the dynastic disputes of Constantinople weakened the Greek power
of resistance as much as did their failure in warfare. On the death of
John VIII, in 1448, the dispute between his sons as to the succession
was settled by Murad, who decided in favor of Constantine, the valiant
defender of Patras. There was, however, no ceremony of coronation;
therefore, strictly speaking, the last Christian Emperor of the
East appears in the long line of the successors of Constantine the
Great,--his namesake,--with a tinge of irregularity in his record. Soon
after this elevation Murad died, February 8, 1451. His virtues are
celebrated by the western chronicler, Brocquière, in the words, “a
mild person, kind and generous in according lordship and money.”
V MOHAMMED II
Mohammed II was only twenty years old when he took up the reins
of government. He was ambitious, was endowed with great physical
endurance, and, from reading the deeds of Julius Cæsar and Alexander,
as they appeared in the folklore tales translated into Arabic,
had conceived a strong desire to transform the tribal and loosely
organized sovereignty of his people into an enduring political power
with a systematic organization. His primary object was the capture of
Constantinople, and to get a free hand for this undertaking, he adopted
a most pacific policy in the first year of his reign. He renewed
the treaties with Genoa and Venice, with the princes of Servia and
Wallachia, and with Hunyadi, Scanderbeg, and the Knights of Rhodes.[Illustration: MEDAL OF MOHAMMED II.]He opened hostilities with the Greeks by building, in an
extraordinarily short space of time, a fortification on the narrow
seas, near the imperial city, which enabled him to collect dues from
all the vessels entering the harbor, and served as a point from which
issued armed expeditions that captured nearly all the Greek territory
outside the city walls. Meanwhile, some slight acts of aggression in
the Morea failed to reveal to the West the real purposes of the new
Sultan. Those who had seen him spoke of him as a mild and learned young
man, not at all the kind of ruler who would walk in footsteps different
from his father’s. The Western Emperor, Frederick III, thought it was
sufficient to write the Sultan a letter, warning him not to attack
Constantinople. Those who were nearer understood his temper better,
knowing that, when Constantine sent a delegation to protest against
the erection of the fortification that had lately been built on the
European shore of the Bosphorus, the Greek emissaries had been beheaded.In the doomed city itself dissensions reigned supreme. Ecclesiastics
had come from Rome to look over the religious situation in
Constantinople with the purpose of reporting the prospects for carrying
out the terms of union, drawn up lately at the Council of Florence.
Their appearance in the city disgusted the common people, who called
their new Emperor a traitor to the Eastern Church, and an irreligious
usurper, who was, after all, they said, not a real emperor, because he
had not been crowned.The Venetians were busy looking after their own interests on the
Adriatic coast or in continental Greece. They were busy arranging terms
with the Sultan, as to the export of grain from Asia, and were so
pleased with their commercial success in this bargain that they only
resolved to allow artillerymen to be hired among the subjects of Venice
by Constantine, not to aid him officially.Outside the city the prospects for successful resistance were quite
as bad. When a delegation came from the East to beg their help, they
were referred by the Signoria to the Holy Father, as the head of the
crusading program. Yet they began to suspect something was wrong when
one of their ships, coming out of the Bosphorus, was fired on by the
Turks, and the crew was taken and massacred. There were a few Venetian
merchants’ galleys in the harbor whose crews, at the Emperor’s request,
took part in the work of defending the fortifications. The Genoese,
fearful of the fate of their colony at Pera, sent an armed force of
1000 men to help defend the city.While keeping up a constant blockade, Mohammed was preparing his plans.
His success, he saw, depended on siege guns, for he fully appreciated
the tremendous revolution in warfare due to the use of gunpowder.
From the many renegades in his camp he had heard of the remarkable
effects produced by bronze cannon in battles and sieges. His adviser in
preparing his siege guns was Urban, probably a Roumanian renegade, who
showed great skill in perfecting the technique of projectiles at this
early stage of their use. To the inventive faculty of this Christian
fugitive in the Osmanli camp, the taking of the great Christian capital
in the Orient was largely due. The weight of the new guns is shown
by the fact that it took sixty oxen to draw the first one, which was
manufactured by the end of February. Fifty similar ones were ordered to
be constructed.Troops from Asia and Slavic contingents from Europe kept gathering
round the city during the winter and early spring; there was besides
an Ottoman flotilla of 300 vessels. By the beginning of April, 1453,
the Sultan, with his court, came to the encampment of the besieging
army, and took up a position two miles and a half away from the city
walls. To each portion of the fortifications a certain contingent was
assigned, specific directions to proceed with the attack being given,
according to the character of the ground and the defenses.In the Sultan’s army there were probably as many men under arms as were
usually taken in the Turkish military expeditions, between forty and
sixty thousand, but the number is not given in the sources. The Emperor
Constantine had not more than 7000 men; besides, as we have seen, the
population were ill disposed to him, because of his concessions to
the Latin Church, and more than once the hostile cry was heard within
the walls, “better under the Turks than under the Latins.” One of
Constantine’s chief officials, Lukas Notoras, had already exchanged his
Christian headgear for a Turkish turban.The Latin element in the town took the chief part in the defense; not
only were one-third of the soldiers from the West, but the galleys in
the harbor, the weapons used, the stores for the siege, all were from
the Occident. Only one of the towers on the city walls was in charge
of a Greek, and the keys of the four chief city gates were kept by the
Venetians. Catalans and Genoese were also given responsible positions;
even in the personal entourage of the Emperor, only a few Greek names
are noted.When the siege opened, the character of Mohammed’s strategy was soon
plain. He had no intention of making a general assault of the ordinary
type; instead, his cannon were directed against weak spots in the wall,
and the work of destruction began. An unsuccessful attempt, however,
was made to surprise the garrison on the 17th of April, and the Sultan
was greatly disappointed when his fleet came out worsted from a fight
with the imperial ships, which issued from the harbor to protect the
entrance of three or four Genoese vessels that were bringing in stores.While the walls on the land side were being bombarded, the part of the
city touching the sea was threatened. Urban, imitating the Venetians,
who had transported war galleys across the land to Lake Garda, brought
some of the Turkish ships from Galata-Pera to the Golden Horn. All
attempts to destroy this hostile flotilla failed; by its presence it
divided the Christian forces, and kept the small army of Constantine
from concentrating in any strength at a threatened point. When May
came, the besieged population began to suffer from scarcity of food.
The only hope of relief was to be looked for from Venice; for the other
powers in the West had received Constantine’s appeals with only verbal
promises, or with indifference. Yet even the Venetians proceeded with
great deliberation. The twelve galleys that had been ordered to be
sent to help Constantinople in February were only ready by May 7th,
and the Admiral, Loredano, was given instructions to handle the Turks
unaggressively. He was told not to engage in a battle with them unless
forced to do so.Slowly the various details of the siege operations were perfected by
the Turks; parts of the moats before the walls were filled up; a bridge
was built from Pera to Constantinople, that gave an admirable basis for
cannonading the city at close quarters. On the 28th the inhabitants
noted such great activity in the Ottoman camp that it was evident the
final attack was close at hand. Mohammed rode from point to point
giving final directions, and word was proclaimed by heralds that every
member of the besieging army should be prepared. The movement in the
Turkish camp began three hours before daybreak. The Christian allies
and the rank and file of the Moslem soldiers were directed to place
ladders at a point in the wall near the Romanos gate that had already
especially suffered from artillery fire. The loss of life among the
assailants, at this point, was very great, but as the élite of the army
did not suffer, the Ottoman leaders were indifferent as to the cost of
getting the ladders near the walls and defenses.The next step was to bring up the Janitschars, who, under the personal
direction of the Sultan and the two chief generals of his army,
commenced operations near the Romanos and two other gates. Compact
in their firm discipline, and protected by artillery fire, with the
smoke of their guns concealing from the defenders their rapid motion,
they pressed ahead. On the Greek side the Emperor kept out of the
tumultuous fighting, leaving the work of active defense to the Italian
Giustiniano, who made a heroic resistance in the interior defenses
of the city, until, struck in the breast by a bullet, he was carried
away to a ship mortally wounded. After this fatality general confusion
followed; there was no one to take the commander’s place. No words of
command were now heard; the Turks, who had been held back from the
high walls, filled up the space between the outer lines of temporary
palisades and the permanent fortifications that were being dismantled
by the cannonading.At the place where Giustiniano had been shot some ladders were set up,
and at the same time a small gate, used by the Genoese soldiers to
pass out of the city to protect the outer ring of the defensive works,
was occupied. By this way a considerable number of the Janitschars
penetrated into the interior of the city. But their entrance was not
noticed by the defenders on the walls, who, in the conflict, had no
time to leave their posts. The sailors of the fleet now landed, ready
to take their part of the spoil. The squadrons of Janitschars rode
without resistance through the narrow streets flanked with wooden
houses, searching for the first of the booty. Every corner was searched
for wealthy citizens, who would be likely to pay large ransoms, and for
valuable slaves. Adult men, actually with weapons in their hands, were
killed, and, of course, no Franks were spared, nor any of the imperial
troops. Small children, too, old men, and invalids, who came in the
way of the Ottoman soldiers, were mercilessly slaughtered; they had no
marketable value. Whole groups of citizens were dragged off, and then
a systematic plundering of churches and private houses began; carpets,
stuffs, precious stones and metals, books, whose binding attracted
notice, all were carried off. (May 29, 1453.)In the sacking of the city the Emperor Constantine perished. When he
saw destruction going on all about him, he is said to have asked, “Is
there no Christian here to cut my head off?” His fate must have come
later, for his body was found on a heap of corpses near the gate that
had first been entered. His head was set the same day on a column of
the Augusteion, a sign to the Greeks that they had no other emperor now
but the Sultan. Then it was placed in a precious casket and despatched
from one Moslem ruler to another as the convincing proof of the prowess
of their Moslem overlord.Three days had been allowed for the sack; after this period the troops
returned to their camp. Some of the streets were then cleaned, and the
Sultan made his solemn entry into the deserted city to the Church of
St. Sophia, which he transformed into a mosque. The Podestà and a few
of the Italians from Pera, who had not actually been under arms, were
protected by a guarantee from the Sultan’s own hand. But the walls of
the suburb were destroyed, all weapons had to be given up, and a slave
succeeded the Genoese Podestà as the supreme authority in the colony.Most of the fleet, taking advantage of the confusion during the capture
of the city, succeeded in getting away, taking with them some fugitives
who escaped by disguising themselves in a Turkish garb. The head of
the Venetian colony and the Catalan Consul were beheaded as disturbers
of the peace, and even Lukas Notoras, the chief Greek noble, did not
escape, although he had led the opposition against Constantine. The
Greek clergy, on the other hand, were treated with great clemency;
they had been trained by centuries into habits of servile obedience
to secular rulers, and, therefore, they could be turned into useful
instruments for ruling the subject Christian population.With shrewd understanding of the religious situation, Mohammed now
appointed as Patriarch in place of the Latin ecclesiastic, who had
escaped from the city, the leader of the clerical opposition, Gennadios
Scholarios. The new Patriarch dined with the new Emperor, and received
rich presents and most courteous attention, befitting his exalted
dignity as a churchman. In place of Santa Sophia, he was given as
his metropolitan church the building known as the Church of the Holy
Apostles. As a new Patriarch, created by favor of the Moslem Emperor,
he kept his rights of jurisdiction over the Emperor’s Christian
subjects.A Moslem governor was placed in the city to order the administration,
with instructions to induce those who had fled from the town to return,
and to arrange for the colonization of the Moslem newcomers. Only a
small garrison was left; and the Sultan took his road to Adrianople
on 18th of June. While the Moslem ruler and his successors spared
the population, and left to their Greek subjects a kind of spiritual
empire, the conquest of Constantinople proved fatal to the many
treasures of ancient art that had survived the Latin conquest of the
city in 1204. The bronze statues of the Emperors were made into cannon,
the bronze inscriptions on arches and obelisks were coined into money,
and the marble statues of pagan divinities were turned into lime.
Valuable antique columns were sawn to make baths, or were transformed
into cannon balls.The Basilica, in which the bodies of the Emperors were buried,
became a mosque; the bones were scattered and the sarcophagi turned
to the basest uses. Forty-two other churches became mosques, or were
secularized; one, St. Irenæus, was employed as an arsenal. Some of the
splendid mosaics in Santa Sophia were hidden by whitewash, because of
their Christian symbolism; near the structure was built a minaret, and
Mohammed’s successors added three more. As time went on, new mosques
were constructed; also hospitals, schools, and palaces, the Sultan
being a great builder. The new population was cosmopolitan, for many
Greek, Servian, and Roumanian towns were drawn upon for their several
contingents, as the Turkish conquests continued.At the time of his great achievement, Mohammed was only twenty-five
years old. He publicly announced that he had reached maturity by
decapitating the Grand Vizier Khalil, the tutor set over him by his
father, who was suspected of treasonable communications with the Greeks
during the siege. He made it plain, also, that there was to be no
repose from war after the taking of the capital, the Servians being
the first to experience his heavy hand. Brankovitch’s fidelity as a
vassal proved no protection to him; for Mohammed wrote claiming his
kingdom. In terror the Servian prince fled to Hungary to secure the aid
of Hunyadi. The war that followed was hotly contested, with the result
that in 1454 the Sultan agreed, on the basis of the large tribute of
30,000 ducats, to recognize Brankovitch.But this peace was not observed, for the conqueror appeared the next
year and took Novoberda. Hunyadi, against whom bitter foes were working
at the court of the King of Hungary, had only the support of the
Wallachian princely house. When Belgrade was attacked by Mohammed,
in May, 1456, only 3000 Christian soldiers were ready to oppose him.
When the siege really began, however, 200 boats appeared before the
city, containing many thousand men of various nationalities, whom the
Franciscan monk, John of Capistrano, had drawn to the crusading cause
by his protracted and widely extended journeys in Western Europe.
Though over seventy years old, he had displayed remarkable energy, and
he was honored by the defenders of Belgrade as a holy apostle.On July 15 the two welcome allies took possession of the castle, as
the city had not yet been cut off from the outside. The first stage
of the defense was the defeat of the Turkish flotilla on the Danube;
some vessels were sunk and others were captured, so that entrance into
the town by water was made safe. In the attempt to storm the defenses
made by the Janitschars, who advanced in small divisions, hardly 600
survived; three times Hunyadi, sallying from the castles, forced back
the assailants. Capistrano’s crusaders proved too much for the Sultan’s
trained troops; marching right up to the guns and careless of the
havoc caused by the cannon fire, those who took part in the sortie cut
down the Turks and threw the cannon into the water and ditches. If the
crusaders had not stopped on the way to plunder, they would have broken
through the Sultan’s own bodyguard. As it was the Ottomans were able
to withdraw safely from their camp; but they lost some of their best
captains, among them Aga, who was killed while protecting the Sultan,
who escaped with an arrow wound.No serious attempt was made to follow up this victory, though Hunyadi
boasted that it was now possible “to take possession of the whole
kingdom of Turkey.” Anarchy prevailed in the motley crowd gathered
in the crusading camps along the river; worse still, owing to the
unhealthful surroundings in the low lands, a plague began, to which the
great Hungarian champion soon fell a victim; not long after Capistrano
also died.Soon after the death of Hunyadi the long career of the Servian Prince
Brankovitch came to an end, and with it closed the history of Servia
as a vassal state, for his death was followed by long and bloody
quarrels over the succession. Finally, the claim of Brankovitch’s
daughter-in-law, Helena, the widow of his son Lazaras, was
acknowledged. Her accession gave Mohammed an excuse for appearing as
the champion of an Ottoman pretender. The Sultan’s influence over the
Servian nobility was increased by the fact that Helena was favorable
to the Latin Church; she placed Servia under the protection of the
Pope, and married her daughter to the heir of the Bosnian kingdom.
But this foreign help availed nothing. Many of the strong places in
Servia were captured, including the city of Semandria (1459). The
Servian “woiwodes,” who preferred the domination of the Sultan to the
acceptance of the religion of Rome, showed themselves disloyal to
Helena the younger, who was obliged to withdraw, to Hungary first, and
then to Rome, where she died as a nun in 1474.After the destruction of Servia, and its absorption by the Ottomans,
came the turn of Bosnia, like Servia disturbed by disputes between
vassal princes, which were taken advantage of by Mohammed. King
Stephen’s pro-Roman policy made him unpopular among his nobles;
therefore, when the Turk’s army appeared, there was no great difficulty
in overrunning the country. The King retired in a panic from his
strongly fortified capital, and while in flight was captured and
afterwards executed (1464). Herzegovina, which still remained in
Christian hands, could not resist the successful aggression of the
Turks, and its occupation took place three years after the annexation
of Bosnia. As Bosnia was a vassal state of Hungary, its King, Matthias,
found himself obliged to look to the safety of his territories.
Scanderbeg, who was alarmed at the taking of Herzegovina, and Venice,
as the mistress of all the cities in the Morea, had just begun to
realize the need of common action to protect their interests.On the part of the Hungarians war was waged on a small scale, but
the Venetians employed a celebrated condottiere, Bertoldo d’Este,
to head an expedition of thirty-two galleys and other ships armed
by many thousand warriors. After some initial successes, the aim of
the expedition failed, because of the death of Bertoldo while he was
besieging the Turkish garrison at Corinth. Hitherto the steady advance
of the Turks towards the south had been furthered by the anarchy
and divisions of the rival races, among which the Albanians and the
Greeks showed the most vitality. In Athens the ducal Florentine line
brought notoriety to its closing days by the romantic record of its
last duchess, the wife of Nerio II, who, when left a widow with the
guardianship of her young son, fell in love with Contarini, a Venetian
officer in Naples. She promised to marry him if he would get rid of his
wife. The condition was accepted, and the young officer, by marrying
the duchess, became master of Athens. Those who had acknowledged the
old duke as their overlord, resented the introduction of Venetian rule,
and appealed to Mohammed to interfere. He bestowed the duchy on a
member of the reigning Florentine house, Franco, who caused his aunt,
the scandal-making duchess, to be imprisoned and afterwards murdered.
The commission of this crime produced discontent, and the Sultan gave
orders to one of his captains to take possession of Athens.Mohammed himself took personal charge of the expedition of 1458,
which was conducted with great cruelty. The Albanians were especially
singled out for savage reprisals. When Tarsos fell, the Albanian
soldiers taken captive were horribly tortured, and at the capitulation
of Corinth the leader of the Albanian contingent was sawn asunder. A
short respite was at first granted to the Greek princes, members of
the house of Paleologi, who were closely allied with the last Emperor
of Constantinople, but they were finally dispossessed, and by the year
1460 nothing of Greece was left in the hands of the Christian powers
except four Venetian strongholds. But these were not to be spared
longer.In 1463 the Morea was ravaged by the Turkish army, and five hundred
Venetian soldiers met death by being sawn apart. In 1467 the
island of Eubœa was attacked by both Ottoman fleet and land forces
simultaneously. Great preparation was made for the defense of the
Venetian citadel, but the plans were spoiled by the incapacity of the
commander of the Venetian fleet to defend the approach to the island
from the sea. The besieged garrison showed great heroism, and even
when they discovered that their leaders were preparing to betray them,
they stoutly held out and inflicted severe losses on the Ottomans. For
reasons which are inexplicable, the Venetian fleet made no attempt to
break down the bridge which connected the island with the continent;
the occupation of this passageway finally enabled the Janitschars to
enter the city. Its heroic defender, Paolo Erizzo, met the fate of
being sawn asunder, because, as a chronicle states, the Turks had
promised to save his head but not his thighs.This heavy blow to Venice stirred the republic to a series of energetic
reprisals. With her allies, the Neapolitans and the Knights of Rhodes,
and aided by the Pope, she carried the war into Asia Minor. The town of
Smyrna was occupied by the Venetian fleet, and the Seldjouk emirates,
always ready to rebel against the Ottomans, were encouraged to revolt.
When Lepanto was successfully protected by the Venetian fleet, it was
felt that Mohammed had at last encountered a power that was ready
to contest the imperial ambitions of Ottoman rule. But that there
was no sufficient ground for over-confidence appeared when a Turkish
general, Omar-beg, invaded Friuli, and began to ravage territories
in the immediate neighborhood of Venice. A Venetian general fell
fighting the Turks on the banks of the Isonzo, and the citizens of the
republic could see with their own eyes the work of the Turks, as they
burnt the villages that lie between the Isonzo and the Taghliamento.
Scutari, however, withstood two Turkish sieges, though Mohammed himself
took part in the operations. Finally, in 1479, Venice, deserted by
her allies, was willing to arrange terms of peace. These involved
the cession of Lemnos and certain possessions in Albania; but more
significant of her humiliation was the payment of a war indemnity of
100,000 ducats, and the agreement to give an annual tribute of 110,000,
in return for which sacrifices certain commercial advantages were
conceded by the Turks.Interpreting the treaty in its strictest sense, Mohammed, after
arranging a peace with Venice, occupied the Ionian Islands, and soon
afterwards showed his contempt for the military powers of Western
Europe by sending a fleet of 150 ships to Otranto in Apulia, a province
of the kingdom of Naples. The town, entirely unprepared for such a
raid, was taken in 1480; the garrison and the archbishop were put to
death, and the neighboring country was organized as a Turkish province
with its capital at Otranto, where a garrison of 5000 Turkish soldiers
was left behind.The alarm created by this feat of arms was instantaneous. The Italian
cities united and soon expelled the Turks from the peninsula, rivaling
their enemies in Asiatic deeds of cruelty. Mohammed could not prosecute
the conquest of Italy, because his attention was necessarily divided
by the troubled state of Turkish rule in Asia, where the Seldjouk
principalities still claimed an autonomy which, on crucial matters,
made them independent of the Sultan.In the north of Anatolia, which was directly in the hands of the
Ottomans, there still remained the Empire of Trebizond, governed by
a Greek prince, David Comnenus. Part of his dominions, Sinope and
Paphlagonia, were conquered in 1461, and then the last Emperor of
Trebizond turned for help to his Turkoman ally, Hassan, ruler of
Armenia and part of Persia. Mohammed struck at his foes rapidly.
Marching on Erzeroum, he forced Hassan to sue for peace, and so the
Greek Emperor was left to meet the Turks unaided. The city of Trebizond
was effectively encircled by land and sea, and David was soon brought
to surrender, and afterwards, with many members of his household,
was put to death. Equally implacable was Mohammed to the Seldjoukian
emirates. At the death of Ibrahim, the Prince of Karamania, the Sultan
intervened, while seven claimants were disputing over the succession,
and after several campaigns annexed the emirate. Hassan’s time soon
came. Feeling the insecurity of his rule, he asked help of Rhodes and
Venice, especially requesting to be furnished with artillery, by the
aid of which so many of the Ottoman victories were won. Two hundred
Italian gunners were sent in answer to his call. In 1472 he took the
Ottoman town of Tokat, and sacked it. This act caused Mohammed to take
up the war against him in person. The two armies met on July 26, 1473,
at Outlouk-Bali, near Terdjan, where a decisive victory was won by the
Sultan. All the prisoners taken were massacred. The Turkomans had no
desire to contest further the predominance of Ottoman rule, which was
now extended without question over both Karamania and Anatolia.It must not be supposed, however, that Mohammed was always successful.
Albania held out against him under the heroic leader Scanderbeg, whose
earlier exploits have been already chronicled. His success against
the Ottomans continued without a break. Even when a nephew proved
disloyal and brought an army of 40,000 Turks into the land, he rose up
and smote the invaders after the manner of his earlier years (1461).
For a time afterward peace prevailed; then, during the Venetian war,
he stood as an ally of the republic. His old antagonist Mohammed had
another opportunity of testing the valor of the Albanian chieftain at a
decisive defeat of the Turkish army under the walls of Croia in 1465.
Two years later Scanderbeg died at the age of sixty-seven, and his
death was followed by civil strife.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'The rounding off of the Ottoman Empire, a process by which the vassal
states were absorbed, put an end to the internal movements against
centralized rule, and enabled the Sultan to work out his policy of
systematic aggression in the regions to the north. After the year 1470
Turkish armies ravaged Southern Hungary, Croatia, Carinthia, Styria,
and Carniola; Belgrade, on account of its strong defensive position,
was respected. In 1479 the Turks made an expedition in force into
Transylvania, where, in the neighborhood of Hermannstadt, they burnt
200 villages. When they were on the point of withdrawing with their
booty they were attacked on the Cornfields (Kenyermezo, October
13), and suffered severe losses. Not more successful were the acts
of aggression on Hungarian territory in the following year; but the
Hungarian King, Matthias, was satisfied with repulsing his enemies; he
had no desire to prosecute the war against the Turks on a large scale,
for he had none of the ambition or enthusiasm of his famous father,
Hunyadi.In the Greek islands the activity of the Turkish fleet produced
positive and permanent results; Lesbos was taken in 1462, and to the
list of Turkish successes in these years were soon added Lemnos,
Imbros, Samothrace. Much more valiant defenders of their island were
the Knights of Rhodes, whom the Sultan was especially desirous of
punishing for the part they had taken in the already mentioned Venetian
expedition against Asia Minor. In 1480 a large Ottoman fleet of about
one hundred ships appeared in sight of the island, and a bombardment
was begun, but the fortifications proved too strong for the Turkish
guns to make any impression, though the siege lasted from early in May
till the end of August, in which time, despite the assaults made on the
citadel, only one tower was taken. The Grand Master, Pierre d’Aubusson,
and his brother, had prepared most intelligently for the crisis by
collecting from all provinces of the Order money, which they used in
providing weapons, especially cannon. They had been furnished also by
the Pope, just before the siege began, with a large store of food and
provisions. Finally, after a heroic defense of eighty-nine days, two
Neapolitan ships forced their way into the harbor and broke up the
blockade.In the Wallachian lands the Ottomans met a redoubtable warrior, who,
in the annals of the Roumanian people, takes such a high place as a
champion against the Turks that the record of his deeds gives him a
rank alongside Hunyadi and Scanderbeg. Vlad, the Prince of Wallachia,
1456-1462, called by the Hungarians the Devil, and with equal
significance spoken of by the Turks as the Impaler, had a reputation
for violence even among his own people. He repressed the internal
troubles of his vassals with an iron hand; for after Mircea’s death
the country had gone through the same period of divisions and intrigues
that is found with such frequency in all the Balkan lands, making them,
as we have seen, an easy prey for the Ottoman.It is told how Vlad brought Wallachia to a peaceful state by the
execution of 20,000 men, and how, afterwards, in the same drastic
style, he resolved to put an end to the annual tribute of 500 children
demanded by his overlord the Sultan. Looking for allies in carrying on
the resistance to Mohammed, he helped Stephen IV to secure the throne
of Moldavia, and married a relative of Matthias, King of Hungary.
Mohammed resolved to nip in the bud the independent movements of his
dangerous vassal, and sent a renegade Greek official, Catabolinus,
with a corps of 2000 Turks to depose Vlad and to replace him by his
brother, Radu. Vlad, having surprised this small force, impaled all the
prisoners he took; to the pasha who led them was accorded the honor
of being impaled on the longest stake. After this outrage the Sultan
sent three ambassadors to reinforce his demands; but, when the Moslem
delegates refused to remove their turbans in his presence, Vlad ordered
their headgear to be nailed to their heads.This picturesque barbarity appealed to the imagination of the Turkish
ruler, who, as an artist in cruelty, conceded that Vlad belonged to a
class above him. When the Turkish sovereign made a punitive expedition
to Bucharest, he found the approach to the town, half a mile long,
lined with stakes, on which were rotting the bodies of 2000 dead Turks.
“How,” Mohammed said, “can we despoil of his estates a man who is not
afraid to defend it by such means as these?” Vlad hung on the invading
army, always inflicting losses, without showing himself long enough
to be attacked in a formal battle. Using his familiarity with the
Turkish language, he penetrated with some companions into the midst
of the Turkish camp, and would have succeeded in murdering Mohammed
himself, had not a mistake been made in selecting the tent. Instead of
the Sultan one of the pashas was killed. Though there are conflicting
accounts as to the details of Vlad’s versatility in defense, we know
that Mohammed gave up his plan of aggression against Wallachia and
returned to his capital, Adrianople.Vlad’s career was cut short by the enmity of his neighbor the Moldavian
King, Stephen, who, afraid of his influence, drove him from his throne,
although he had relied on Vlad to promote his own interests when the
Moldavian succession was in dispute. This was, of course, a gross
error in statesmanship, for the only possibility of resisting Turkish
aggression in these extreme Eastern lands of Europe depended on the
close coöperation of Moldavia and Wallachia. If Wallachia were once
occupied by the Turks, Moldavia’s invasion was certain to be the next
step. After Vlad’s expulsion, he took refuge at the court of Matthias
of Hungary.His successor, Radu, was entirely devoted to Turkish interests; and
soon after this change of rule in Wallachia, Stephen of Moldavia
was able to seize the seaport town of Kilia, whose inhabitants were
not unwilling to accept an overlord of better reputation than Radu,
whose close relations with the Sultan had made him an object of
contempt (1465). In the hostilities that followed between Matthias of
Hungary and Stephen of Moldavia, the Hungarian King, who had taken up
Vlad’s cause, was beaten at the battle of Baia. Stephen then invaded
Transylvania, captured Peter Aron, the pretender to the throne of
Moldavia, and put him to death. Peace was restored with the Hungarians
on terms that were advantageous to Stephen, who received two fortresses.Not long after this Hungarian incident, which, like so many others,
weakened the power of resistance to Turkish arms, Stephen invaded
Wallachia with the intention of dethroning the Sultan’s favorite, Radu.
The Moldavian prince prepared for war against the Turks by entering
into negotiations with the Venetians, who, as we have seen, were
indefatigable in organizing a general league against Mohammed. An
ambassador, who had been sent by the republic to secure the coöperation
of the Persian King, Louzoun Hassan, visited Stephen, and proposed him
as leader in organizing a holy league against the Ottomans, “in order,”
as he said, “that we may not be left alone to keep up the struggle
against them.” But before the Venetian envoy had passed beyond the
Balkan lands, Mohammed’s army, in great force, was already swarming
over Moldavia. To meet them Stephen had only some 50,000 men, mostly
of his own nation. With these and a few Hungarians he won a brilliant
victory over 120,000 Turks at Rakova in 1475, where he killed 20,000
men, took 100 standards, and many prisoners, including four pashas.
Pursuing the defeated army, he massacred a large part of them. A church
was built to celebrate the battle, and a solemn fast was initiated,
followed by the impaling of many Turkish prisoners. This success of
Stephen was celebrated as a unique feat of arms in Western Europe, and
deservedly so, for the trained troops of Mohammed had been hewn down by
a peasantry armed only with pikes, scythes, and axes.Stephen asked help from the Pope and from Venice to carry on the
struggle; but he got no aid, for the Venetians were worn out with the
long war against their Eastern foes, and the Pope explained that all
money for defense had been turned over to Matthias of Hungary, the
overlord of the Moldavian King. Matthias, however, proposed to spend
the money at home, as he dreaded the inevitable increase of Stephen’s
power if he were to inflict another decisive defeat on a Turkish army.
When the Turks appeared again, the help of the peasant population could
not be secured because they were simultaneously alarmed at the news of
a Tartar invasion, said to have been timed to coincide with the passage
of the Danube by the Turks.The Moldavian nobles, however, and their men-at-arms, made an heroic
stand against Mohammed’s army; their cannon did such execution that
the Janitschars threw themselves on the ground to escape the rain of
projectiles. The Sultan was forced to lead his men in person to save
the day. So stout was the stand the Christians made that the combat
lasted far into the night. When most of his nobles had been slaughtered
Stephen withdrew from this battle, which was fought at Razboieni, July
24, 1476. After he had been pursued to the forest country in the north
of Moldavia, he was finally forced to withdraw to the inaccessible
mountain regions. Here, with characteristic enterprise, he gathered
together a second army, and the Turks, who already were exhausted by
the strenuous campaign in a country ill provided with food, and ravaged
as they were by disease, were easily driven back across the Danube.
After this success Wallachia was invaded the same year by the Moldavian
Boyars, who were joined by the Transylvanians under their new leader,
Bathory. The pro-Turkish prince of the country was dethroned, and
Vlad, the mighty hammerer of the Turks, now again an ally of Stephen,
was replaced by the latter on the throne; but the veteran leader did
not long survive his restoration. He died in December, 1477, near
Bucharest, in a fight with the Turks, who attacked him as soon as
Stephen had withdrawn to Moldavia. He was buried in a monastery founded
by him at Snagov, but no inscription marked the resting place of the
Christian champion.Mohammed’s own reign was closed on the 3d of May, 1481, in Anatolia.
For some time, owing to his excessive weight, campaigning had been
difficult and painful for him. In the latter years of his life he was
often so incapacitated by gout that he was compelled to give up more
than one important warlike expedition, and it was to this disease that
his death was due. During his reign the Turkish Empire acquired much
new territory; Anatolia was occupied as far as the northern reaches of
the Euphrates, and in Europe the Balkan peninsula was made subject to
his arms as far as the Danube. Many successful expeditions were also
made far beyond these limits, both on the east and on the west. But
two great obstacles to Turkish advance he failed to overcome: Rhodes
and Belgrade, the latter stronghold commanding the Danube, while the
former was the key to the Ægean.
VI SELIM AND SOULIMAN
In the line of succession were two sons, Bajesid and Djem. Bajesid
managed, by rapid marching, to reach Scutari before his brother, and
was proclaimed Sultan. Djem, who had occupied Broussa, proposed a
division of the empire, but Bajesid refused, and defeated Djem in a
decisive battle, fought at Yeni-Chchir (1481). The defeated brother
took refuge first in Egypt, with the Sultan of the Mamelouks, and
afterwards appeared as a suppliant at Rhodes, where the Grand Master,
fearing to keep so valuable a hostage, sent him to France, where he
remained for several years in captivity. Djem finally ended his life as
a victim of the Borgia Pope, Alexander VI, who is charged with having
murdered him to secure the favor of Bajesid. So long as Djem lived,
Bajesid was wary of stirring up the enmity of Occidental Christendom;
he feared the effect on the stability of his throne by the return of a
pretender, backed up by Christian armies. He even refused to answer the
appeal for aid sent him by the last King of Granada, only venturing to
show ineffective sympathy by sending a fleet to cruise off the Spanish
coast.Charles VIII of France, encouraged by his successful expedition into
Italy, planned a new general crusade against the Turk, and secured
promises of coöperation from various Western powers. He kept in touch
with the Christian population of the Ottoman Empire, and even looked
forward to taking the imperial throne of Constantinople by purchasing
title deeds to it from the Paleologi family.After Djem’s death, which was soon followed by that of Charles, the
Sultan had a free hand. From 1492 to 1495 he warred with partial
success against the Hungarians; then came the turn of Venice, whose
Italian dominions again saw a Turkish army. In the Morea, also, the
republic lost some of the few cities it still possessed. There Nauplia
held out, but Modon, Navarino, and Coron passed into the possession of
the Turks. Under Papal leadership, an anti-Ottoman league was formed,
and the Christian fleet proved its prowess by destroying two Turkish
flotillas and by ravaging the shores of Asia Minor.Internal troubles in Asia Minor, defeats in Hungary, and a long,
troublesome war with the Sultan of Egypt brought the warlike
enterprises of Bajesid to an end. The Sultan’s sons through their
dissensions darkened the close of his reign; all three rebelled. Of
the three, the most successful in opposing his father’s power was
Selim, who won the Janitschars over to his side, and through their
interference was able to enter Constantinople in triumph, and there
enforce his own conditions. Bajesid first offered large sums if Selim
would withdraw to the Asiatic province, of which he was governor;
finally he consented to accept him as heir and co-regent on the throne;
but Selim had secured the influence of the troops, and they demanded
the Sultan’s immediate abdication. Bajesid was obliged to accede to
their request, and only asked that he might be allowed to withdraw to
die at Demotica, the place where he was born. The third day after his
abdication he died. Because of its suddenness, his death, as was so
often the case in those days, was said to be due to poison.Selim’s path after his accession was anything but smooth; the troops
were not amenable to discipline, and there were a host of brothers and
nephews, who were in no mood to accept him as their lord. Besides his
own son, Souliman, there were ten princes who stood near the throne.
All were taken and murdered. Though Selim affected to explain their
executions as due to reasons of state, his acts were severely judged
by his contemporaries. The Turks called him “The Inflexible,” while
in the West he was entitled “The Savage.” Foscolo, the Venetian,
described him as the cruelest of men, “a man who dreams only of
conquests and wars.” He was a well-educated man who favored the pursuit
of literature, and it was said that the only individual who was ever
able to induce him to revoke a death sentence was the grand mufti,
Ali Djemali. His viziers felt the implacable nature of their master;
seven of them were executed, for whenever the soldiers were restless
the vizier was made a victim of the Sultan’s discontent. According to
an old report one of them only agreed to accept the dangerous office
after Selim had beaten him with his own hands. Intractable at home,
Selim, so far as Europe was concerned, proved a pacific prince, his
name being recorded only in connection with one expedition against the
Christians. His Christian vassals, too, were left undisturbed; all
that he exacted from them was the payment of a regular tribute. To the
Moslem dissenters in Persia of the Shiite sect, he showed himself an
implacable persecutor, all the more because his animosity was excited
by the encouragement given to his rebellious brother Ahmed and his
three sons by Ismail, the master of Persia. Ismail also negotiated
an alliance with the Sultan of Egypt against the Osmanlis. Selim
began in his own provinces by organizing a systematic massacre of the
schismatics. Then followed a holy war against the Shah, in 1513, in
which Selim led an army of 140,000 warriors; and after three campaigns,
in one of which a great pitched battle was fought at Tchaldiran
(August 24, 1514), he extended the domains of the Ottoman far to the
east, bringing to submission Georgia and Kurdistan, and overrunning
Mesopotamia and the parts of Syria that were controlled by the Moslem
lord of Egypt.By the expansion of his empire in this direction he soon came into
conflict with the Sultan of the Mamelouks. Aleppo was taken, and,
when Selim entered the city, he was hailed in the great mosque as the
guardian of the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina, a title which
gave the Ottoman Sultan almost the rank of the Khalif of the faithful.
Damascus also fell into his hands, and so rapid were the successes of
the Ottomans, that early in the year 1517 Selim found himself within
sight of Cairo. The Mamelouks made an heroic resistance; protected
by their coats of mail they charged into the center of the Turkish
position, killing the vizier and ten generals. But here, as so often,
the superiority of the Turks in artillery decided the day, and Cairo
was taken after a prolonged and desperate struggle. Selim proclaimed
an amnesty in favor of the Mamelouks; 500 of them, trusting in the
conqueror’s promises, surrendered and were decapitated, and 50,000 of
the citizens of Cairo were massacred. Touman, who led the Egyptian
forces, was finally taken and hanged.Egypt was allowed to retain its ancient organization, with its
irregular force, the Mamelouks, and its twenty-four Begs as military
commanderies; but the direction of the government was placed in the
hands of the Ottoman Pasha. With the possession of Egypt Selim became
lord of Yemen, its dependency, and so exercised actual control over
the holy places of the Moslem faith. At Cairo he had found a sheik,
an obscure and neglected personage, called Elmo-stansir-bi-illah, who
was reputed to be in the direct line of descent from the second branch
of the Abbasides Khalifs. Selim kept him in confinement until, on the
promise of securing his liberty, and for a small money payment and a
pension, he agreed to transfer to the Turkish ruler all his claims to
the Khalifate.Selim’s victories made a great impression. Venice, whose commercial
interests were affected, sent ambassadors to Cairo to arrange for
paying the tribute that was due to the Sultan of Egypt for the island
of Cyprus. Hungary asked to have the truce prolonged between the two
powers, and the Shah of Persia sent gifts and congratulations. Selim
died on September 22, 1520, while he was preparing for an expedition
against the island of Rhodes. He was succeeded by his only son,
Souliman, a ruler whose long reign, from 1520 to 1566, makes him a
contemporary of the great European leaders of the sixteenth century,
a fact which Paul Veronese recognized when he placed him in his
celebrated painting, “The Marriage at Cana,” along with the chief
sovereigns of the day.As the lines of expansion in the East and in Africa had been closed by
the remarkable achievements of Selim, Souliman’s hands were free to
take up the traditional line of aggressive progress of Turkish power.
Hungary was attacked on the ground that the payment of tribute was
refused. In 1521, after two important battles, Belgrade was besieged
by the Sultan; the fate of the city was decided by the defection of
its Servian and Bulgarian allies. Twenty assaults were made, and there
were only 400 able-bodied men in the garrison, when a mutiny among the
inhabitants forced the town to capitulate on August 29, 1521.The conquest of Rhodes, the center of Christian resistance in the East,
was now not long delayed. A large navy of 200 vessels appeared off the
island with a summons to the grand master, Villiers de l’lsle Adam, to
surrender. Souliman had collected an army of 100,000 men to undertake
the siege, but the defenders were not terrified. Every assault made
on the great bastions of the citadel caused enormous losses among the
Turks; but their prolonged artillery fire and the new supplies of
men, drawn constantly from Asia, showed the mere handful of defenders
that their struggle could have only one outcome. In December, 1522,
the island capitulated on terms that were favorable to the heroic
defenders; even the Sultan appreciated the tragedy, for he is recorded
to have said to his favorite Ibrahim, that he was loath to force this
Christian commander, in his old age, to leave his house and his goods.[Illustration: SULEYMAN THE MAGNIFICENT(In Youth.)]The next field of Souliman’s military enterprise was Persia, where
the Shah, by the defection of an Ottoman official, had recovered some
of the territory taken by Selim. Souliman, appearing with a large
force, received the submission of many of the Shah’s vassals, and,
after a long march to the East, during which his cannon had to be
abandoned, entered the ancient capital of the Khalifate, Bagdad, in
1535. But several other campaigns were required to establish definite
possession of the country. Finally, after many victories, peace was
signed at Amasia, on the 29th of May, 1555, a step which implied that
the Sunnite Turks acknowledged the legitimacy of a Shiite monarchy.
In the mountains of Armenia and Kurdistan the extension of Ottoman
power encountered serious obstacles. Native chieftains and princes
followed their own caprices and their own interests in changing their
allegiance to Shah or Sultan. There was constant guerrilla warfare,
without any notable advantage to Turkish arms. In the southern regions
at the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates, the Ottoman power
was firmly established; Turkish vessels were to be seen now in the Red
Sea and the Persian Gulf. Aden was occupied and the control of Yemen
made effective. But the chief effort of Souliman was directed against
the King of Hungary and the Emperor Charles V. A curious and novel
development of European diplomacy was seen, when Francis I, the French
King, appealed to the Sultan in his difficulties, after his defeat
at the hands of Charles in Italy. Souliman sent a gracious message
assuring the imprisoned monarch of his support, and spoke of his own
throne as the refuge of the world; “night and day,” he added, “our
horse is saddled and our sword girded.” In 1526 the Sultan marched
from his capital to give battle to Charles, the “hated head of the
infidels,” with an army of 100,000 men and 300 cannon. There was a
great battle with the Hungarian troops at Mohacs (August 28, 1526).
After a hot engagement of two hours, the Christians left on the field
20,000 foot and 400 horse, and of the prisoners 400 were put to death.A few days after the battle Buda surrendered to the Turks, and the
Hungarian kingdom was harried by the Turkish irregular forces.
Everywhere they went, their path was marked by massacre. Ten thousand
captives were taken, and the result of the campaign was almost the
disappearance of Hungary as an independent Christian kingdom, because,
after the taking of Buda, Souliman called to him the Hungarian nobles
and settled who should be their king. The kingdom was now rent by
factions, some of the nobles siding with the Sultan’s candidate, John
Zapolya, while others accepted Ferdinand, the brother of Charles V.
When Zapolya appeared at Constantinople, because of the failure of his
faction to support his claims, the Sultan, after securing from him a
formal engagement as vassal, undertook to place him on the Hungarian
throne. The promise was more than made good. In October, 1529, the
Turks appeared before the walls of Vienna with 250,000 men and 300
cannon. To defend the city there were only 16,000 men and 70 pieces
of artillery. But the defense was conducted with such spirit and
intelligence that the Turkish army was compelled to withdraw. When
winter approached, the extent of the ravages of the Turkish arms was
marked by attacks on Regensburg and Brunn. Later on, another expedition
was made into Styria, where the country suffered terrible devastations.Under the stress of these alarms the powers of Western Europe,
irrespective of religious differences, banded together to resist the
enemy. Even Francis I was concerned at the rapidity of the success
of his ally, the Sultan, and sent an ambassador to Constantinople to
entreat Souliman to hold his hand. Finally, owing to the difficulties
with Persia, the Sultan agreed to sign a treaty of peace with Hungary
in 1533, by which Ferdinand was allowed to hold the land already
occupied by him. But the war with Charles V, and with his ally, Venice,
still went on, chiefly a contest at sea between the Turkish admiral,
Kheir-ed-Din, and his Venetian antagonist, Andrew Doria, without
decisive results, except the capture of many of the Venetian islands
in the Ægean. In 1541 steps were taken, when dissensions arose again
in Hungary between the heirs of Zapolya and Ferdinand, to make the
conquest of part of the country effective. A Turkish pasha-lik was
formed, with Buda as its capital, and for 147 years Buda remained an
Ottoman city. Further conquests were made of Van, or Stuhlweissenburg,
the city where the Hungarian kings were consecrated, and Vychegrad,
where the royal crown of Hungary was kept. Owing to the valor of the
people there were repeated efforts on the part of the Hungarians to
renew resistance to the Ottoman domination. A treaty was made in 1567,
when the aged Sultan, worn out by constant warfare, was willing to
concede to the Emperor Ferdinand an arrangement for the payment of an
annual tribute. Although peace was formally declared, disturbances on
the frontier still continued, and the seas were not free from acts of
piracy.As Spain had not been included in the treaty of 1562, a Spanish
flotilla of twenty-two ships was destroyed near the island of Djerba,
which had previously been seized by Spain. Not long afterwards a
Turkish armada of 191 vessels sailed against the island of Malta, with
the purpose of bringing to the home of the Knights Hospitalers the ruin
that had already been inflicted at Rhodes on their brethren. For four
months the siege lasted, costing the assailants nearly 20,000 men.
Dragut, the Turkish commander, was slain, and finally, on September
11, 1565, the undertaking was abandoned as hopeless, and the Turkish
armament withdrew.Souliman’s days were brought to an end in the midst of the siege of a
Hungarian town, Sziget, one of the many events of the frontier warfare
carried on without intermission, irrespective of the treaty between the
heads of the two states. His death was carefully concealed from his men
for fear of discouraging them in their assaults on the citadel of the
town, which was being heroically defended by Zriny. Three days after
the Sultan’s death, on the 8th of September, 1566, only the central
tower of the fort was left in the hands of the Hungarian champion. He
loaded up his cannon to the muzzle, and in the smoke of the cannonade
rushed into the thick of the Turkish lines and perished. He had taken
care to arrange for the blowing up of the powder magazine at the time
he made his sortie. The great tower fell in ruins, burying in the
débris 3000 Turks. Souliman, in his life of seventy-one years, had
personally led sixteen campaigns against the Christians; despite gout
and physical weakness he would not hand over to a lieutenant the work
of wiping out on the battlefield the stigma inflicted on Turkish arms
by the failure at Malta.
VII THE DECLINE OF THE OTTOMANS
In the expansion of their empire the main characteristic of the
Ottomans had been fidelity to their tribal origin in Asia and to their
religion; they showed little elasticity in modifying their system of
government to new conditions, but they did recognize the necessity of
progress. After their conversion to Mohammedanism their supreme guide
was the “cheriat,” under which term is signified the religious law
of orthodox Moslems in the threefold division of Koran, Sunna, and
the Sentences. In addition to this, there were the various official
interpretations from the Sultan’s hand in the application of the law
called the Kanoun. So much importance had this aspect of the Sultan’s
functions that Souliman is remembered under his title of El Kanouni,
that is, as a Turkish Justinian, rather than as a great military leader.As head of the Empire, the Sultan’s various titles are significant of
the progressive stages of Ottoman development from a tribe to a great
world power. The sovereign was still called Khan, as the head of a
Turkish nomadic horde. When the Turks were converted to Islam, there
was first added the title emir, an Arabic word, Chief of Believers;
then came the name sultan, king; after the conquest of Constantinople,
the Persian term padishah, king of kings, came into use. As we have
seen, the conquest of Syria, of Egypt, and Arabia, made the Sultan
defender of the holy cities and khalif.After the conquest of the capital of the Cæsars, the influence of
Byzantine traditions introduced a rigid system of court ceremonial;
the days of patriarchal simplicity were closed; the person of the
Sultan was raised in dignity. The change is clearly indicated in an
edict by Mohammed: “It is not my will that anyone should eat with my
imperial majesty; our ancestors were wont to eat with their ministers,
but I have abolished it.” The influence of the Byzantine bureaucratic
hierarchy can be traced in the method of Ottoman administration; even
in small details the permanence of the Roman imperial tradition is
noteworthy. The sovereign’s documents were, like those of his Greek
predecessors, written in gold, purple, and azure. His letters of
victory are but a continuation of the “litterae laureatae,” while
the bakkchich given to the Janitschars is but a reminiscence of the
Imperial donation.But actual assimilation between the Turks and their subject peoples
was prevented by difference of religion. Racial differences made no
distinction between Greeks, Albanians, Slavs, and Roumanians; they were
all orthodox Christians, while the same people, if they became converts
to Islam, were turned into Ottomans. The two types of religious
allegiance were mutually irreconcilable. The peculiarity of Ottoman
absolutism is to be found in the exclusion from governmental offices
both of the free Moslem and the free Christian subjects of the Empire.
The administration from top to bottom was in the hands of slaves, and
these slaves were largely recruited from the children of Christian
families of the subject races, who were constantly exposed to a
detestable and unnatural form of oppression. The conquered populations
were ruled despotically by men of Christian birth, who, during their
initiation into slavery, had become Moslems. The famous Admiral Dragut
was the son of a Christian of Asia Minor. Many of the famous generals
were taken from Christian Albanian, Bosnian, and Dalmatian families. Of
forty-eight grand viziers, only twelve were of Moslem birth.Many Christians also became renegades, since an easy road to fortune
was opened to them in this way. The hardy, adventurous, and less
scrupulous elements of the conquered races accepted the religion of
their conquerors; even a Paleologus, one of the last descendants
of the imperial line, became a Moslem. There were conversions on a
large scale, accomplished without special pressure among the landed
proprietors, who were warriors by tradition, and who refused to endure
the restrictions placed upon them by their religious profession.The absolutism of the Sultan allowed no rival in any of the religious
dignitaries of Islam. Even the Cheikh-ul-Islam had no authority over
the Sultan; though the supreme ecclesiastical dignitary, he was only
an authoritative expert in the law, the head of the body of oulemas,
whose opinions could, if necessary, be passed over. At the same time
the Cheikh-ul-Islam’s advice carried weight, and we sometimes hear
of ambassadors being protected from the rage of the Sultan by his
intervention. Legally, the Sultan was altogether above the law, or,
rather, outside of it; he had the right to execute his brothers and
children “if the peace of the world required it.”While women in the household of the Padishah played no conspicuous
rôle, there were exceptions to the rule. Under the institution of the
harem the Sultan’s wives were slaves, and frequently domestic discords
that had an influence on the destiny of the Empire were the result
of harem intrigues. Often the sons of the Sultan were children of
different parents. It was remarked in the time of Souliman that one of
his wives, Roxelane, perhaps a Russian, acquired great ascendency over
him. The Venetian ambassador reported that Souliman, contrary to the
custom of his ancestors, had taken her for his legitimate wife. She
became practically an empress, and was responsible for the Sultan’s
policy on several occasions. The war with Persia and the undermining of
the power of the grand vizier were due to her.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'As to the army, it kept the basis marked out for it by Ala-ed-Din. The
élite body of the Janitschars still formed the chief protection of the
Sultan’s power. From the regular tribute of blood only Constantinople,
Athens, Rhodes, a few other islands, and the Mainotes, the Laconian
mountaineers, were exempted. Every five years the officers of the
Sultan passed through the villages where children of the peasants
were collected, and each fifth one was taken. Oftentimes Christian
families were glad to pay the exaction even before the tax collectors
appeared. Many of the members of the corps preserved traces of their
early faith, and so drank wine without scruple. The solidarity of the
body was maintained by exceptional privileges; their pay was large;
they had a special share of the booty, or regular donatives, and the
assurance of a pension for old age. The Janitschars were forbidden
to marry or to engage in any trade. They could be punished only by
their own officers, and even the grand vizier had no jurisdiction
over them. In the time of Souliman they numbered 12,000, and as their
numbers increased their turbulence grew. Selim attempted to meet this
difficulty by incorporating in their body 7000 of the palace servants,
and by dividing the command.In the government of the subject peoples no uniformity was observed.
The inhabitants of mountain regions, the Albanians, the Montenegrins,
the Mainotes, the dwellers on Mt. Libanus, were protected from
tyrannical actions. Where the country was level, there were no bounds
to the barbarity of Turkish governmental methods. The vassal states,
such as Transylvania, Moldavia, Georgia, were still ruled by native
princes. But under Ottoman rule, in spite of the constant wars and the
attendant anarchic conditions, there was worked out a crude kind of
unity throughout the Empire. At least, with an Ottoman overlord, there
prevailed a condition of internal peace between the various portions of
the Empire, that gave stability to commercial relations and rendered
communication easy between distant parts. Religious persecution in
the sense in which it had existed in the Byzantine Empire, and in the
Eastern domains of the Italian municipalities, was now unknown. At
Rhodes the Greeks preferred the new régime to the rule of the Knights
Hospitalers, who, as Latins, had showed no sympathy with the Orthodox
Church. In Crete and Greece the Turks were more popular as masters than
the Venetians; and the Servians, Hungarians, and Roumanians preferred
Moslem control to that of Catholic Austria.Economically, the substitution of Turkish for Byzantine rule was a
benefit to the Greek industrial population, who were better protected
against foreign competition than they had ever been. Customs duties
were arranged by an ad valorem scale, under which the Italian merchants
were taxed four and a half times as much as the native Christians,
although these, in turn, paid more than the Moslem traders who were
favored by the Ottoman government. The Greek parts of the Empire
entered upon an era of prosperity such as had not been seen since
before the Latin conquest of Constantinople. For example, a large
colony of Greeks established themselves at Ancona, where, in 1549, they
transacted business to the annual value of 500,000 ducats. Moreover,
the persecution of the Moors and Jews of Spain brought much capital
into Ottoman territory; soon there were numbered 30,000 Spanish Jews at
Constantinople, and 15,000 to 20,000 at Salonica. On this commercial
basis the national renascence of the Greek peoples was founded. The
landed proprietors of their own race mostly became Moslems, while their
scholars and literary men found a refuge in the Occident; but the
traders made and kept a place for themselves. Hence there was created a
new center in which the old ideals of an independent Greek nationality
could grow.The Slav peoples were much worse off than the Greek population, because
over their provinces were scattered Turkish garrisons, and through them
passed the roads used by the Sultan for the interminable expeditions
into Hungary. They retained fewer traces of autonomous existence,
and their clergy were more ignorant than the Greek. The higher
ecclesiastical positions were never bestowed on Slavs, and their landed
gentry mostly became Moslem. The Roumanians, who were more remotely
situated, preserved, under the form of vassalage, a complete national
organization. They paid a moderate tribute, and were obliged to furnish
military contingents, but there were no Turks in their territory, and
no mosques were built among them. Wallachia and Moldavia, in the time
of Souliman, made more than one attempt to throw off Turkish rule, but
both principalities were compelled to submit before the middle of the
sixteenth century.The Turkish conquest of North Africa begins, strictly speaking, with
the resistance of the Moslem Berber tribes and princes to the extension
of Spanish influence over the African Mediterranean coast towns. This
was a primary object of Charles V, who was bent on following up, by
his control of sea power, the expulsion of the Moors from Spain. After
many vicissitudes, Kheir-ed-Din, who had a powerful rival supported by
the Spaniards, became King of Algiers. He turned to ask help from the
Sultan of Constantinople, Selim, and he offered, in return, to become
his vassal and to incorporate his small kingdom as an integral part of
the Ottoman Empire.Selim sent to Kheir-ed-Din 2000 Janitschars, well realizing the
importance of using Algiers to block the progress of Charles V in his
North African ambitions. Four thousand men were also recruited in
Anatolia to defend the Moslem cause. It was a critical time, when the
Viceroy of Sicily (1519), at the head of an armada of forty ships,
appeared off Algiers. The Spaniards were beaten off, and many of the
ships were lost in a storm. An even greater success for Moslem arms
was the conquest, ten years later, of the citadel of Peñon, which
commanded the harbor of the city that had for long been in the hands
of the Spaniards. The island on which it stood was, by instructions
from Kheir-ed-Din, joined to the mainland, and so an impregnably
fortified harbor was constructed, which turned Algiers into the lasting
home of those Barbary pirates that were for so long the plague of the
Mediterranean commerce.In 1535, Tunis was captured by Charles V in person, that monarch’s
great expedition of 400 ships and 30,000 men having proved too strong
for Kheir-ed-Din, who had hurried to save the place with only 9000
men. At Algiers, the Emperor’s next objective, Kheir-ed-Din could not
take part personally in the work of defense, since he was not kept in
command of the Turkish fleet. The government of Algiers was turned
over to Hassan Aka, no idle leader. The Christian Emperor’s armada was
calculated to inspire terror; when it gathered at Spezzia, in August,
1541, it numbered 65 galleys and 451 transports, ready to embark the
29,000 troops, German, Italian, and Spanish, and the members of the
Knights of Malta. In addition to the Emperor, who was in command, there
were a large number of high officers of the various arms, and members
of the nobility from Charles V’s wide domains.To oppose this brilliant host, Hassan had only 800 Turks, 5000 Moors,
some Moriscos from Spain, and a few renegades from the Island of
Majorca. There were rumors of treachery on the part of Hassan, but when
the actual attack was made, nothing was left undone by him to keep up
an effective resistance. He was helped by a severe storm, which caused
much damage to the fleet; many ships were driven ashore, where the
crews were attacked and the cargoes seized. An attempt to attack one of
the forts by which the city was defended failed; the imperial troops
got near the walls, but no farther; even the heroism of the Knights
of Malta failed to save the day. The Spanish admiral, Doria, insisted
that the expedition should reimbark, as his ships could not hold their
anchorage. No other attempt on such a scale was made to arrest the
progress of the Turkish vassal powers in North Africa. Tripoli was
conquered in 1556, and there was incessant warfare with the Sherif of
Fez, and also with the Spaniards, who still continued to hold Oran.After the death of Hassan, the Turkish Beglerbeg at Algiers was
Euldj-Ali, the son of a Calabrian fisherman. He had given up his faith
and become one of the most dreaded Corsairs in the Mediterranean.
He promoted the revolt of the Spanish Moriscos, afterwards winning
a great success at Tunis, where, in 1573, Don John of Austria had
brought 27,000 men to defend the Spanish citadel in the harbor. Euldj
gathered an overwhelming force, took Goletta, and massacred the Spanish
garrison. By this decisive victory Tunis became the seat of a Turkish
pashalik. His next step was to make the throne of Morocco dependent on
the Sultan.The government of these African provinces was strictly centralized;
over the whole was a Beglerbeg, who transmitted to his subordinates
the directions which he received from Stamboul. The military strength
of the provinces was remarkable, notwithstanding the unimportant part
played by the regular Turkish soldiers. In their place there were
regiments of renegades, Kabyles, and mercenaries of many nationalities.
The navy was made up of corsairs, organized in a kind of guild, whose
members made a life business of hazardous expeditions on the sea for
the purpose of plundering vessels or harrying coast towns. No effort
was made to interfere with the local customs of the tribes in the
interior. All that was asked by the Beglerbeg was free passage for
military expeditions and the payment of a large tribute.Turkish rule was maintained with a very small display of military
power. The whole country was controlled by little more than 15,000 men,
most of them in a small number of garrison towns. Scattered through the
country were small divisions of soldiers, whose chief business was the
collection of the tribute. For the purposes of local government there
were artificial tribes made up of natives, placed under the authority
of a sheik or religious personage. The government of Algiers gave these
groups certain landed concessions, and they paid some small dues to
the sheik. They were expected to support soldiers or travelers when
these appeared in their territory. They lived in tents or huts along
a highway and the principal group was called a konak. In addition
there were the real tribes, of warlike temper, that had once been
independent; they paid no tax on their land or herds, but they had the
function of collecting the tribute from inferior tribes called raias.
This recognized position was enough to secure their loyalty.The Algerian corsairs became famous for their ravages in the narrow
seas, for their ships were models for speed and lightness, and their
crews worked under the strictest discipline. Each vessel carried
soldiers, cannon, and artillerymen. The merchant vessels they seized
were brought back to Algiers, where the passengers, crews, and cargoes
were sold at auction. These undertakings proved most profitable to
the captains, “Reis,” who built themselves a quarter of the town,
where they lived in houses resembling fortresses, since their captives
were kept in these buildings (bagni) until they could be sold. So was
formed a Barbary aristocracy, which ended by winning its independence
from Turkish rule. Among the corsairs were many renegades, especially
Italians.Algiers developed from a small town to a city of 100,000 souls. Many
of the captives gave up Christianity and won their freedom. With
such elements it is not surprising that the hold of the Turks on the
inhabitants became weakened, until finally, not long after Greece won
its freedom, Algiers was conquered by the French in the reign of Louis
Philippe.After the death of Souliman the Ottoman Sultanate underwent an eclipse.
The succession of strong rulers was broken, and the empire was largely
under the direction of the women of the harem and slaves. Of the eight
successors of Souliman, one only can be called a military leader; many
were mere children when they were called to the throne. Even Murad IV
(1623-40), the most active of all, took the title of Sultan when he
was twelve years old, and his career ended when he was twenty-eight.
But even under such unfavorable conditions the progress of Turkish
conquests was not arrested.Of the western powers, the chief rival of the Ottoman Empire, during
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, was Venice. At the cost of
a yearly tribute of 236,000 ducats, she enjoyed great commercial
privileges, was mistress of possessions in the Levant and on the
Dalmatian coast, and blocked the way to complete Ottoman domination.
Though Rhodes had been taken from the Knights, as we have seen, the
large islands of Cyprus and Crete were still in the hands of the
republic of the Adriatic, and her possessions in the Ægean Sea were a
constant source of annoyance to the Turkish lords of the Morea. Piracy
flourished in these ports, which became centers of retaliation for the
excesses of the Barbary corsairs.Aggressive measures were taken by Selim, Souliman’s successor, who,
after long years of peace between the two powers, summoned Venice, in
1570, to surrender the Island of Cyprus. One hundred and seventy-one
Ottoman galleys supported the demand. Venice had tried to get the
Christian powers to coöperate against the Turks, even calling on the
Persians and the Arab tribes of Yemen to aid her in the defense of the
island. But the arms of the Turkish generals soon prevailed. The chief
fortress of the island, Famagusta, capitulated in 1571; and with its
fall the Turks began the occupation of the island, which only ended
after the war between Turkey and Russia in 1878.During the progress of the siege an anti-Turkish league had been
completed, composed of Venice and the Papacy, Spain, the Knights of
Malta, and many Italian states. The result was the despatch of a large
fleet under the command of Don John of Austria, at this time a youth
of only twenty-two years. The objective of the armada was Patras,
because, in the Gulf of Lepanto, close at hand, all of the squadrons
of the Turkish navy were assembled. In all, the allies had 208 ships
of war, the Ottomans slightly more, but the weakness of the Turks was
due to the lack of soldiers to defend their fleet. There were but
2500 Janitschars on their galleys, the rest were troops raised from
continental Greece, 22,000 in all, who were either new recruits or
were not trained for naval warfare. Among the Turkish captains were
present many older men who desired to avoid conflict with the Christian
armada. Of a different temper were Hassan Pasha, the son of the famous
Kheir-ed-Din, and Ali-Muezzin-Zade, the new captain pasha of the whole
fleet.The Christian fleet was in an admirable state of preparation for the
fight. It was composed entirely of armed vessels directed by skilful
rowers; besides the 203 galleys there were six galiasses, great
floating citadels carrying heavy artillery and 500 soldiers. Don
John had also armed the Venetian vessels with contingents of Spanish
infantry. On the side of the Christians there was the additional
advantage of superior equipment in armor and weapons for the individual
warrior. The soldiers wore helmets and breastplates, and were armed
with arquebuses, while the Turks used lances and arrows. There were
also superior numbers on the side of the allies, the fighting men
numbering between 28,000 and 29,000.The two fleets took up the same position and adopted the same tactics.
In the center on each side were collected the largest ships under the
command of the respective chief admirals. Some initial successes were
won by the Ottomans over the division made up of the Venetian vessels,
but in the center, after desperate fighting, the men under Don John,
owing to their superior weapons, got the better of their enemies, and
the captain pasha was killed. The Algerian vessels showed much tactical
superiority to the Christian right wing, under the command of John
Andrew Doria; but, although they inflicted much damage, they could not
save the day for the Ottomans. The victory cost the Christians dear,
for they lost 12 galleys and 7500 men. But the defeat of the Turks was
overwhelming; 15 galleys were sunk, 177 were captured, and many pashas
and governors of provinces lost their lives; 12,000 to 15,000 of the
galley slaves on the Turkish vessels, Christian captives, were set free.Such was the remarkable victory of October 7, 1571, remarkable not only
for the heroism displayed, and the sensation caused by the success of
the Christians, who had for so long been incapable of resisting Ottoman
aggression, but also because of the small practical results produced.
The Christian armada returned to Corfu, and from there made for the
coast of Italy, where it disbanded. On the side of the vanquished,
Euldj-Ali, gathering together eighty-seven ships as a nucleus for a
new Ottoman fleet, sailed into the harbor of Constantinople, and was
welcomed as a conqueror by the Sultan and the grand vizier, Sokoli. New
honors were heaped upon him, not altogether undeserved, for during the
winter a new fleet, larger and better armed than the one destroyed, was
made ready for sea.The recuperative energy of the Ottoman Empire was not lost on the
Venetians, and their agent at Constantinople, Antonio Barbaro, saw that
there was more than an empty boast in the words of the Vizier, who
said to him, “There is a great difference between your loss and ours.
By taking from you the Kingdom of Cyprus we have cut off your arm; by
defeating our fleet you have only shaved our beard. A beard grows out
thicker for being shaven.” This argument appealed to the republic, and
in 1573 peace was made. The conditions were the cession of Cyprus,
the payment of a heavy war indemnity by Venice, and a regulation of
the frontier in Albania and Dalmatia, that secured to the Turks their
ancient possessions there. The Venetians also were required to increase
the annual tribute exacted for the Island of Zante, which was still in
their hands.Three generations after the taking of Cyprus the long-coveted island
of Crete, or Candia, was annexed to the Ottoman Empire. Hostilities
began between Venice and Sultan Ibrahim I, because of the seizure by
the Knights of Malta of a Turkish vessel carrying high officials of the
court to Egypt. The Maltese ships were received in the friendly harbors
of Crete, where they took refuge. In April, 1645, a great fleet of 302
ships, and a large army of over 100,000 men, commanded by a Dalmatian,
Pasha Joseph Markovitch, set sail for Crete. In June, one of the two
chief fortresses of the island, Canea, was invested. After two months’
siege it surrendered. In 1648 began the first siege of Candia, but this
stronghold proved as hard to capture as Rhodes. During the course of
twenty-one years it was the objective of repeated attacks on the part
of the Turks, and only fell into their hands in 1669.As has been seen, the Ottoman Empire began to decay from the top. The
Sultan finally became the mere figurehead of palace intrigues, and the
effect of the rottenness in the supreme head of a centralized military
despotism was widespread. Taxation became extravagantly burdensome;
the royal domains were alienated, the coinage was debased, offices
were sold to the highest bidder, and this general venality caused the
disappearance of the military fiefs from which the armies of the empire
had been recruited.The Janitschars lost their characteristic qualities as warriors when
the custom of recruiting them from the Christian population was
abandoned. They finally degenerated into a mere rabble of turbulent
blackguards, composed of the worst elements of all nationalities,
Christian and Moslem, who disappeared from the ranks during a war,
or fled from the battlefield and lived normally by blackmail or
by illicit trading. The abandonment of this living tithe was due
probably to the jealousy of the Moslem families, who objected to the
monopolizing by men of Christian birth of the lucrative privileges
attached to an élite corps. The last time the tithe was collected
was in 1676, when 3000 youths were brought in as recruits. With the
abolition of the Janitschars dates the rise of the bands of brigands
among both the Slavic and Hellenic populations. The able-bodied members
of the conquered races found in this sphere of activity a chance for
developing their capacities in guerrilla warfare; with the training
and traditions so acquired they were able in later years to act as
the leaders in the national movements which, during the course of the
nineteenth century, ended in the dismemberment of the Ottoman provinces
in Europe.  *  *  *  *  *SPANISH CONQUERORS
I THE SPANIARD AND THE NEW WORLD
In the century which followed the discovery of America, not only was
the lead in initiative taken by Spain never lost, but she practically
had no competitors in the conquest and colonization of the New World.
If the lines of medieval enterprise had been followed in the opening
up of new territories for economic development, it should have fallen
either to Venice or to Genoa to undertake the work of exploration
and exploitation of these unknown regions. But times had changed,
and the Italian republics had changed with them. Under the stress of
the Turkish conquests, which had led to the organization of a great
military and naval power in the East, Venice could follow nothing but
a policy of self-protection that admitted neither of expansion nor of
adventure. Internal changes in the Italian peninsula, indicated by
the overlordship of Milan, had reduced the power of Genoa, which had
already been weakened by her long contest with Venice for the naval
mastery of the Mediterranean.The rise of Spain was phenomenal; nothing exactly resembling it had
been seen before, except in the case of those great tribal or national
invasions that so often altered the face of Europe. For centuries,
like Italy before the advent of Italian unity, Spain was only a
geographical expression. Only fourteen years before Columbus’ first
voyage, the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile had
consolidated the royal power on the Iberian peninsula and made these
two Spanish monarchs lords of the whole land south of the Pyrenees,
except in the kingdoms of Granada in the south, of Portugal in the
west, and of Navarre in the north. A steady policy of aggression and
conquest soon brought about the disappearance of the small kingdom of
Granada. Between 1486 and 1489 Loja, Malaga, and Baza had been taken;
Granada alone held out a few years more. Ferdinand, a most astute
monarch of the type of Louis XI of France and Henry VII of England, had
already crushed the Portuguese faction in Castile, who had favored the
alliance of their queen with the King of Portugal. His ideals were for
an absolute monarchy, which, by the elimination of feudal traditions
and by the accumulation of wealth, might become the predominant power
in western Europe.There was no reason for Spain to become a colonizing power in the
modern sense, since the peninsula was a sparsely populated country,
large tracts of land having been opened up for occupation by the
Christian conquests of Moorish territory. In preceding centuries,
when the Christian princes began to win back, piece by piece, the
lands belonging to the Moslems, a conciliatory policy had been adopted
towards the conquered race; the Moors had kept their personal liberties
and had been encouraged to group themselves in autonomous communities
in the suburbs of Christian cities. Even when Granada was taken,
favorable terms were given to its inhabitants, although in the end the
promises were broken. They were conceded liberty of person, trade,
education, and worship, the protection of Mohammedan law, administered
by Mohammedan judges, and the benefit of mixed tribunals. But here and
elsewhere Ferdinand’s methods were a consistent application of the
principles of an autocrat, and, when the New World fell as a prize to
the Spanish conquerors, the usages of expansion by conquest at home
in the Iberian peninsula were mercilessly applied. When Malaga was
taken, the captive inhabitants were sold as slaves; one-third of the
proceeds of the sale was taken for the redemption of Christian captives
in Africa; another was given to those who had served in the army of
occupation either as mercenaries or as officials, and the remaining
portion was paid into the royal treasury. As to the land, it was laid
out for a colony. The large tracts opened to colonization were offered
on easy conditions to the Christian inhabitants of Spain.It was not land hunger, therefore, which prompted the Spanish monarchs
to accept Columbus’ scheme of a westward route to the rich empires of
the Orient. Profit-bringing trade by which stores of specie could be
accumulated attracted the founders of Spanish absolutism. The project
itself was not viewed with skepticism; its scientific basis was cogent;
there were besides widely circulated stories of land existing in the
West. But the one practical difficulty in the way of fitting out the
proposed expedition was the war with the Moors of Granada, by which the
Spanish treasury had been exhausted. After the city fell in January,
1492, several months were spent in haggling over terms. Columbus
had made up his mind that if the voyage were sucessful he should be
adequately rewarded for his trouble. Apart from conditions as to
offices and the administration of the newly acquired possessions, it
was agreed that he was to receive one clear tenth of all merchandise,
whether gold, silver, pearls, spices, or whatsoever else was gained
or gotten for the crown in his new jurisdiction. Moreover, there was
a further clause inserted that in case Columbus should choose to
contribute to the equipment of vessels employed in the new trade to
the extent of one-eighth, he was to be at liberty to do so, thereby
entitling himself to one-eighth part of the profits.The prospects of a great trading adventure seemed altogether alluring.
It must be remembered that the discoverer carried with him a letter
from the Catholic monarchs to the Grand Khan of Tartary; and that
it was this opening up of a direct trade route, with enormous
possibilities for commercial profit, that inspired the Spanish conquest
of America. Even after the configuration of the new continent had
been made out by later voyagers, the fascination of establishing
a connection with the Orient remained a strong inducement. Then
as it faded away as an immediate possibility, the opportunity of
securing large hoards of the precious metals stimulated discovery and
exploration. The lust of territorial conquest remained associated with
the lust of gold. The Spanish adventurer had no ideal aims; he was
not attracted by the American continent because it offered a new home
or because it presented a chance for trying political experiments.
There was the same single-mindedness in the conquistador ideal as is
seen to-day in the trust magnate who is searching for oil wells. The
sordid aims called forth by the success of Columbus’ expedition were
not developed by the contest with the natives occupying the lands whose
possession was coveted.When the Spanish conquerors arrived in those unknown islands of
the western sea the American continent was held by a number of the
Turanian races which had one time peopled most of the Old World. Only
a few relics of their predominance are seen in the Europe of to-day
in the Basques, the Finns, and the Esthonians. Long before historical
times the process of uniting Asia and Europe with America had begun.
Probably thousands of years before the rise of Caucasian civilization
along the Nile and the Euphrates, Turanian hordes found their way
across the Behring Straits. Little capacity for attaining the arts of
civilized life was shown by the American Turanians; there were, it is
true, differences in social organization, but the general level of
civilization was not far above the savage type, even in the Valley of
Mexico or in Quito and Cuzco in South America.Those who took part in the overthrow of the Aztec and Inca governments
magnified their own achievements by describing themselves as the
conquerors of great civilized empires. Such fictions were natural in
men who desired to exalt the difficulties of a suddenly achieved fame,
and the exaggeration was the more easily believed because of their
seizure of large stores of those precious metals by which, in the Old
World, progress in civilization was measured. From the point of view
both of the home government and of those who took part in the first
cycle of voyages, there was not much encouragement of profit to be
derived in the islands and shores of the mainland touched by Columbus
and by those who worked under his leadership and inspiration from
1492-1517--that is, during the first twenty-five years of Spanish
conquest.In the first voyage of Columbus much of the coast of Hayti was explored
because of the stories told as to the existence of gold on the
island. In the second expedition, made the following year, Dominica,
Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, Jamaica were discovered. The foundation of the
first Spanish city on the island of Hayti was laid; then the explorer
passed along the north coast of Cuba, which especially interested him
because he took it to be the mainland of Cathay and Cipango not far
from Malacca. In 1498, after discovering Trinidad, he reached the
South American continent at the mouth of the Orinoco River, which was
identified by him as one of the streams of the terrestrial paradise.
Then followed complaints of administrative abuses which led to
Columbus’ return to the Spanish peninsula as a prisoner.There was a fourth voyage in 1502 which extended as far as Honduras.
After showing a piece of gold to the natives Columbus inquired of them
by signs where the metal could be found. They pointed to the east,
and after some further communications Columbus was convinced that the
land of Cathay lay in that direction. He spent many weeks afterward in
tacking along the shore against adverse winds and currents. Finally he
landed at a place called by the natives Veragua, where the signs of
civilized life, indicated by the village communities and the numbers
of temples and sepulchers constructed of stone and lime, and suitably
decorated, and, above all, the abundance of gold demonstrated to him
that he had reached the golden Chersonese of the East. This was the
land, he was sure, that had furnished King Solomon with his famous
treasures. He set out from Veragua certain of discovering after a few
leagues’ journey the straits of Malacca. After that, to reach the mouth
of the Ganges would only be a matter of a few days. When he found the
peninsula larger than he expected, he turned back to Veragua, meaning
to found a permanent settlement there; but the warlike natives forced
him to take refuge on his ships. Disheartened, the explorer withdrew
to Hayti, from whence he returned to Spain, where he died on May 20,
1506.There was a curious vein of mysticism in Columbus’ character, which
comes out in a quotation made by him in his later years, from the
famous medieval Apocalyptic, Joachim of Calabria. “The Rabbi Joachim,”
he writes, “says that out of Spain shall come he who shall rebuild the
House of Mount Zion.” His discovery, the explorer explained, would
bring about the recovery of the Holy City and of the Sepulcher of
Christ by means of the gold which would be found in the Indies. When he
returned the first time from Hayti to Spain, he wrote that those whom
he left behind would easily collect a ton of gold while he was absent,
and that, therefore, in less than three years the capture of the Holy
Sepulcher and the conquest of Jerusalem could be undertaken. Later on,
he provided that the accumulated income of his property, which was to
be invested in shares of the Bank of St. George in Genoa paying six
per cent., should to the extent of one-half go to aid the expenses of
recovering the holy places in Palestine.The constant quest for gold that stimulated the voyages of the great
explorer had, therefore, its basis in this extraordinary and fanatical
revival of the spirit which had once inspired the Crusades. It was
almost a mania with Columbus, whose letters contain eulogies on gold:
“Who hath this, hath all that can be desired in the world; gold can
even bring souls into Paradise.” Though the metal could not be found
in great quantities, he discovered nevertheless a way by which the
New World might be made to yield the gold which was wanted. It was
Columbus who started in America the traffic in human beings. The day
after he arrived in the West Indies, he talked of the prospect of
using the Indians for slave traffic, and he promised to send to Europe
a whole shipful of these idolaters. He kept his promise also, for
in 1495 he sent five hundred Indian captives to be sold at Seville.
The next year three hundred more arrived at Cadiz. It has been not
unnaturally supposed that the harsh treatment received later on by the
explorer at the hands of the governor of Hayti had a close connection
with Columbus’ persistent policy of recruiting slave gangs from the
natives of the islands he had visited. It is certain that Isabella
was so outraged by the constant stream of West Indian slaves which
had its source in Columbus’ discoveries that she frequently directed
their repatriation. It is significant also that Bobadilla, the man who
sent Columbus back to Spain in irons, is spoken of by Las Casas as an
upright and humane person.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'This willingness to allow the inauguration of a trade in slaves in
lieu of the export from the New World of the precious metal which was
so persistently sought for may be also explained by the strangeness
and uncouthness of the inhabitants of the West Indian islands. Apart
from the Mexicans and Peruvians, the greatest extent of the New World
was inhabited by peoples who had not yet got beyond the hunting stages
of culture. They used, of course, articulate speech, they had the
knowledge of fire, and employed a few rude instruments of stone and
wood, but they were essentially savages, and up to this time man in an
actually savage stage was not known to Europeans--even to travelers.
Marco Polo, indeed, had told of the existence in the East of races who
devoured human flesh, but he was not believed. It was the voyage of
Columbus that revealed the practice to be a literal fact and gave it
such impressive emphasis that the Indian name Carib or Caribbee, in
the modified form of cannibal, came to be used to designate the savage
who feeds on human flesh. The smaller islands of the Antilles were all
occupied by branches of this parent stock, the Carib, all of whom were
distinguished by savage ferocity. The name was given them by a rival
race, the Arawaks, who under various designations lived in the four
larger islands, Cuba, Jamaica, Hayti, and Puerto Rico. Both peoples had
come from the opposite coast of South America, probably drifting to the
islands by the help of the equatorial current. On the mainland there
was constant warfare between the two, with distinct advantages on the
side of the Carib.When Columbus reached the Antilles, the Arawaks in Cuba and in Hayti
were in process of extermination at the hands of the Caribs. The
work of subjugation commenced by the savage Carib was taken up by
the Spaniard; in a few years the Arawaks of the larger islands were
absolutely destroyed. The vigorous race in the smaller islands was
never dominated by the Spanish conquerors; even when Spanish domination
in the islands gave place to English and French rule, the Carib kept
up the contest for more than a century. But the long years of warfare
caused their numbers to dwindle away. As late as 1773 a military
expedition was ordered to be sent to the island of St. Vincent to
exterminate the Carib population, who refused to be reduced. But in
place of drastic measures it was resolved to deport them. They were
finally removed to the mainland of Honduras, where from this original
small group the increase has been so remarkable that to-day their
settlements extend from Belize to Cape Gracias a Dios.Hayti, the island where the first city of European foundation in the
New World was established, may be taken as illustrating the point where
the island population had reached the most advanced standard of life.
It is true that in part of the island the Caribs had effected a landing
and were driving the less warlike Arawaks before them. But Hayti, when
the Spanish conquest began, was already an agricultural country. It
had no dense forests; there was an absence of larger game; the climate
was mild and equable, and there were broad open tracts of country well
adapted to cultivation. When the island was discovered, the population
was estimated to be above a million; a few years later, in 1508, when
under the cruel methods of the Spanish conquest the inhabitants must
have been very considerably reduced, there were still 60,000 males
left. The island was probably therefore more densely populated than
any part of the mainland. The natural food resources in the shape of
fish and small game could hardly support such a number. The growing of
maize was not unknown, but the evidence goes to prove that the natives
lived largely on the product of enormous manioc plantations. The root
of this plant was reduced to a pulp, the juice was pressed out, and
after being exposed to heat, the residue took the form of a meal that
could be turned into bread cakes. The preparation of a crop of manioc
was not difficult. The great savannah lands of the island, which were
covered with prairie grass, were burnt over; the soil was thrown up
with a pointed stick, hardened by fire, a few cuttings of the stem were
planted in, some slight weeding was done, and after twelve months,
without additional labor, there was ready a heavy crop of roots that
could be immediately converted into bread. According to Las Casas’
estimate the labor of twenty women working six hours a day for a month
was sufficient to provide bread enough to last three hundred persons
for two years. The ease with which the crop was grown is shown by the
naïve offer of a native chieftain to his Spanish masters to substitute
for the tribute of gold which his people had no way of providing, an
enormous field ready planted, which was to extend across the island
from Isabella in the north to Santo Domingo in the south. The bulk of
the natives including the males did not work at this primitive method
of tillage, nor did they share in the breadmaking, but apparently
their freedom from this kind of labor did not encourage other types of
industry. The only metal worked was gold, though the island contained
both copper and tin. For cutting they used stone implements, and for
fishing bone hooks. Owing to the mild climate little clothing was
necessary. The cotton plant was not artificially cultivated, both
cloths and hammocks being made out of the wild cotton. Little attention
was paid to housebuilding, though there were some large joint family
houses. There was no stone architecture, and even fortification in its
simplest form was not known.For the purposes of warfare the island was divided into five
districts, each of which contributed several thousand warriors under
an independent chief, whose office was devolved upon him by hereditary
descent. The warlike equipment was inadequate, not equal to that used
by the aggressive Caribs, who had the training which comes from the
hunting of large game. The Arawaks were therefore completely at the
mercy of their savage assailants, unless they fought the Caribs with
overwhelming numbers on their side. When the Spaniards began the
conquest of the island the mild natives had, therefore, no chance of
withstanding even small numbers of Europeans.As a further test of the stage of culture reached by these, the most
advanced of the islanders, we may take their religion, which proves
their affinity to the lowest peoples known. They practised a simple
form of fetichism combined with ancestor worship. There was a class of
wizards, both men and women, who were supposed to control the spirit
world. The multitude of spirits were embodied in the form of idols,
sometimes in human shape, made of various materials. There were also
idols consisting of the wooden figures of dead chiefs set up over
their places of burial. The most famous of this type of idol were the
images of the two first ancestors of mankind that were kept in the
cave from which they had emerged after the deluge. As worship to these
divinities, rude hymns were recited and manioc bread was used as a
sacrificial offering and afterwards distributed among the worshippers.The backward condition of the islanders did not discourage the projects
of colonization which were inaugurated immediately on Columbus’ return
from his first voyage. In 1493 the new flotilla showed the expansion of
the hopes based on the discoverer’s success of the year before; there
were now seventeen ships carrying 1200 men: miners, artisans, farmers,
noblemen, all bent on the work of colonization. Twelve priests were
included in the party. The exploration of the interior of the island
was taken in hand by one of Columbus’ lieutenants, whose object was to
discover gold and to commence the systematic working of the mines.It was nearly a year before the Admiral returned to Hayti. In the
meantime affairs in the nascent colony were in anything but a happy
condition. The colonists, dissatisfied probably because fortunes
were not coming quickly enough, were sending to the home government
petitions and complaints condemning Columbus’ administration. A royal
commissioner was soon sent out, whose personal inspection of the
island resulted in a most unfavorable report being despatched to the
Spanish sovereigns. Internal dissensions continued, due to quarrels
over questions of jurisdiction, but these difficulties were less
serious than the miseries occasioned by the oppression of the natives.
Though Las Casas describes them as “the most humble, patient, loving,
peaceful, and docile people, without contentions or tumults; neither
fractious nor quarrelsome, without hatred or desire for revenge, more
than any other people of the world,” the advent among them of colonists
and adventurers bent on introducing the advanced economic system of
Europe changed everything. A tribute was laid upon the whole population
of the island which required that each Indian above fourteen years of
age was to pay a little bell filled with gold every three months. In
all other provinces the natives were to pay an “arroba” of cotton.It was soon found that these taxes could not be collected. Accordingly,
in 1496, a change was made; instead of gold and cotton, labor was
substituted. The Indians near the plantations were obliged to prepare
and work them. Such was the origin of the “repartimiento” system which,
applied to a population unused to regular toil, and administered by
harsh and unprincipled masters, transformed the larger Antilles into
virtual prison houses. The natives who resisted were treated as guilty
of rebellion and were sent to Spain to be sold as slaves. Oftentimes,
in order to escape this servitude, whole villages and even tribes would
take refuge in the forests. Regular raids were organized against those
who tried to evade the tribute; those who were captured were sent to
Spain. In 1498 the vessels of Columbus, fleet took home a consignment
of six hundred, one-third of whom were given to the masters of the
ships to cover the freight charges.There were scruples on the part of the home government against
sanctioning such an arrangement, and on more than one occasion, in
applying his policy of “pacific penetration,” Columbus acted without
waiting for royal sanction. After the two years’ insurrection of
Roldon, the chief justice, had been brought to an end by mutual
agreement, Columbus, in order to institute an era of good feeling,
made a generous distribution of slaves and lands among Roldon’s
supporters. Each man was to receive a certain number of hillocks for
the purpose of manioc culture. The operation of tillage was placed in
the hands of an Indian chieftain whose people were obliged to dwell
on the land they cultivated. Those of the former rebels who chose to
return home received from one to three slaves apiece. Fifteen took
advantage of this last offer; but they soon found themselves confronted
by a royal proclamation which directed that all holders of slaves given
them by Columbus should return them to Hayti under pain of death. An
unfortunate exception was, however, made in the case of Indians who had
been taken as rebels.Further indications of the attempt of the home government to curb the
economic exploitation of the island introduced by Columbus are seen in
the instructions given to Nicolas de Ovando, who succeeded Bobadilla as
royal governor in April, 1502. He was directed to convert the Indians,
not to maltreat them, nor to reduce them to slavery; to require them
to work the gold mines, but to pay for their work; to refuse to allow
Jews or Moors to have access to the island; to accept blacks as slaves.
The idle and the dissolute were to be returned to Spain, and all mining
concessions made by the previous governor were to be revoked. Ovando’s
rule was to extend over all of the West Indies, with his residence on
Hispaniola (Hayti).The expedition conveying the new chief was of imposing size; there
were thirty ships and 2500 persons. On board was the famous Las Casas,
afterwards the apostle and champion of the Indians, who came now to
make his fortune in the New World like so many other adventurers. The
attraction of the reported mines of gold was irresistible, and it can
be imagined how great was the joy of the Spaniards when the first news
they heard in the colony was the report of the finding of a huge nugget
of gold thirty-five pounds in weight. This treasure was dug up by an
Indian girl not far from the settlement of San Domingo.Equally reassuring as a foundation for the prosperity of the colony was
a second piece of news which recounted how, in a part of the island,
there had been an uprising of the natives which had been successfully
punished, and in which the victors had reaped the reward of turning
the captured rebels into slaves. It was well known that the feeling
in the home country was becoming distinctly unfavorable to a colonial
polity practised so ruthlessly on the natives. The Spanish sovereigns
had declared themselves to be the protectors of the Indians, and had
ordered them both to be treated mildly by the civil authorities and
to be prepared for Christianity by the representatives of the Church.
They were to be civilized, and taught the Spanish language and habits
of industry. No arms should be sold to them, nor strong drink; there
was to be cultivation of the soil, but it was not to be done under
duress. The Indian lands could be bought or sold, and the natives were
to be encouraged to adopt autonomous municipal institutions under the
direction of the priests. They were also to have the right of appearing
in court to act as witnesses or to institute suits. As to the mines,
they were permitted to work in them, but were not to be forced. Even
tribal customs were allowed to be continued, where they were not
contrary to the ethical obligations of a higher type of civilization.It was an almost idyllic scheme for assuming the white man’s burden,
but it remained a paper reformation; as the testimony of Las Casas
shows. For some time before his ordination this untiring advocate of
the rights of the natives lived in Hispaniola the life of the ordinary
Spanish colonist. He acquired slaves; worked them in the mines, and
devoted himself with such assiduity to the control of the estates
previously acquired in the colony by his father that he declares they
turned in to him a yearly income of 100,000 castellanes, an enormous
sum, considering the purchasing power of money at the beginning of the
sixteenth century.The gold fever caused terrible havoc among the colonists; they were
not used to manual labor, they knew nothing of the methods of mining,
they were poorly supplied with tools for the work. Often they rushed
to the mines without taking with them an adequate supply of food.
The tropical climate soon brought on a strange disease, probably
pernicious malaria. Under its ravages, in a short period, 2500 of
Ovando’s men met their deaths not long after they came to the colony.
The conditions of life were hard, even food being scarce in the
neighborhood of the mines, and, when the royal tax of one-fifth was
deducted from the small proceeds after the expenses were paid, the
colonist’s share was barely sufficient to cover his living expenses.
The few who were contented with agricultural pursuits were really
better off in every way, but in the mania for gold discovery no thought
was given to the magnificent resources of the soil.Las Casas notes that the worst effects of this colonial policy began in
the year 1504, when Queen Isabella’s death became known. Ovando’s short
and easy methods with the natives are described with great vividness
by Las Casas, who took part in the warfare against one of the native
chieftains. It was, of course, a conflict in which the weaker race
could play their part only through ruse and stratagem, for, as Las
Casas says, “all their wars are little more than games with little
sticks such as children play in our countries.” Nor were the natives
well qualified even for this sort of hostilities, since they were “most
humble, most patient, most peaceful and calm, without strife or tumult;
not wrangling nor querulous, as free from hate and desire for revenge
as any in the world.” Even Columbus, in the hearing of Las Casas, bore
witness to their humane qualities. He said that he met with such gentle
and agreeable reception and such help and guidance when the ship in
which he sailed was lost there, that in his own country and from his
own father better treatment would not have been possible.The escape of the natives to the mountains and their efforts to
retaliate started, according to Las Casas, the war of extermination.
When the governor Ovando arrived in the part of the island which
was ruled over by a woman chieftain, Anacaona, more than 300 chiefs
were brought together and assured of the pacific intentions of the
Europeans. “He lured the principal ones by fraud into a straw house,
and, setting fire to it, he burnt them alive; all the others,
together with numberless people, were put to the sword and lance; and
to do honor to the lady Anacaona, they hanged her.” Death by fire,
administered with the most exquisitely devised tortures, was the fate
of the Indian chieftains. “I once saw,” he continues, “that they had
four or five of the chief lords stretched on the gridiron to burn them,
and I think also there were two or three pairs of gridirons where they
were burning others.” The fugitives were hunted down by boar-hounds who
were taught and trained to tear an Indian to pieces as soon as they saw
him.Although Cuba had been discovered by Columbus, no attempt was made to
occupy the island until 1511, when his son Diego, acting under the
powers conferred upon him by the home government, selected Velasquez,
one of the oldest and most respected colonists in Hispaniola, to
take charge of the enterprise. With only three hundred men he easily
occupied the island. Like the Indians of Hispaniola they were not able
to organize any effective resistance. There was a repetition of the
atrocities by which Hispaniola had been pacified. By 1521 the miserable
natives were so brought under control that they were turned into the
unwilling and inefficient instruments of the colonial policy of their
new masters.Las Casas was present at the close of this expedition, and he speaks
of frequent burnings and hangings of the inhabitants. Many committed
suicide to escape the enforced working in the mines. The following item
in his indictment deserves to be reproduced: “There was,” he says, “an
officer of the king in this island to whose share 300 Indians fell,
and by the end of three months he had, through labor in the mines,
caused the deaths of 270; so that he had only 30 left, which was the
tenth part. The authorities afterwards gave him as many again, and
again he killed them; and they continued to give and he to kill.... In
three or four months, I being present, more than 7000 children died of
hunger, their fathers and mothers having been taken to the mines.” The
concentration of the conquerors on economic success may be gathered
from the experience of Las Casas himself, who, though he had done all
in his power to restrain the commission of cruel deeds, wherever he was
present, did not hesitate to take advantage, priest though he was, of
the “repartimiento” system, under which he received a valuable piece of
land and a number of Indians to work it, in recognition of the services
he had rendered in conciliating the natives.Columbus, it must be remembered, received an authorization to deport
from Spain criminals under sentence of either partial or perpetual
banishment. Other delinquents had had their sentences remitted provided
they agreed to go to the Indies. The result among such a motley crowd,
released from the ordinary pressure of social obligations, was a laxity
and dissoluteness such as was seen in the nineteenth century among
frontier communities. Even Columbus spoke with no admiration of the
colonists. “I know,” he said, “that numbers of men have gone to the
Indies who did not deserve water from God or man.”Despite the fact that the exploration and subjugation of the larger
Antilles went on with feverish energy, Puerto Rico and Jamaica both
being taken in 1509, the profits of the colonial system were most
disappointing. The expeditions were costly, there was no economy in
organization; at home and abroad, there were a host of officials who
had to receive salaries. The gold mines were poor in quality. The
native population, by war and disease, had been so much diminished
that labor became scarce. The smaller islands were then drawn upon to
keep up the supply of labor in Hispaniola, and as the death-rate still
continued excessively high, the place of the natives was filled by
negroes imported from the Portuguese colonies in Africa. Some negroes
were taken to Hispaniola as early as 1505. In 1517 the African slave
traffic was authorized by Charles V.A more intelligent side of the colonial system was seen in the aim
of the government to acclimatize in America European plants, trees,
and domestic animals. From the time of the second voyage of Columbus
there had been detailed government orders, according to which each
ship that carried colonists should also be provided with specimens of
such seeds as might be useful. Though there were very few domesticated
animals in America, it was soon found that the European varieties would
flourish there. Las Casas often speaks of the astonishment caused
among the natives by their first sight of the horse. This animal soon
became an economic necessity, and in many places herds of wild horses
in unoccupied regions proved how fast the original stock multiplied
in the newly discovered countries. Cattle also soon became one of the
chief articles of internal trade between the colonies, and hides were
one of the staple goods carried on the fleets engaged in West Indian
trade. Sheep and European poultry also were introduced with great
success. As to plants, the vine was not encouraged because the mother
country produced more wine than was needed for home consumption, and
it was an article that could be transported easily to the colonists.
The introduction of the sugar-cane was a social benefaction, for it
set the settlers free from the burden of gold mining under unfavorable
conditions. The sugar industry was developed rapidly after the
introduction of negro labor.With the prevailing ideas of state control of industry, colonial
autonomy was out of the question. The need of a central body with
supreme powers was suggested from the first by the dissensions caused
by the conflict of jurisdiction between the various officials, whose
spheres of action were not carefully distinguished. In 1509 the king
decided to establish at Hispaniola a supreme tribunal which could hear
appeals from the decisions of the governor. From this body grew the
committee called the Real Audiencia, or royal court of claims, which,
after 1521, governed most of the West Indies. The function of this
body was to look after the welfare of the natives, to watch over the
executive acts of the governor and other functionaries, and to put a
stop to abuses. An appeal from the committee lay to the Council of the
Indies in Spain. This body was given final jurisdiction in all civil,
military, ecclesiastical, and commercial affairs. With the consent of
the king it named the viceroys, the presidents of the Audiencia, and
the governors, and it had full control of the higher ecclesiastical
patronage.There was also the Indian Chamber of Commerce, the so-called Casa de
Contratacion, which was intrusted with the supervision of the West
Indian trade. This body saw to the provision of ships, received all
goods, and had jurisdiction of all commercial questions between the
colonies and the home country. Through the “Casa” passed all the
enormous mineral wealth that came from the opening up of the mines on
the continent of America. In 1515, owing to the representations made
in Spain by Las Casas of the grievances of the native population,
Cardinal Ximenes sent three friars of the order of St. Jerome with
full authority to act on behalf of the Indians. Las Casas was
appointed protector. When the commission was under discussion, he
asked specifically for unconditional liberty for the natives and for
the suppression of the serf system in all its forms and provisions,
in order to enable the European proprietors to work their estates
profitably. These humanitarian efforts had little effect in arresting
the prevailing methods of exploitation. When the pearl coast near
Trinidad in the northeastern region of South America attracted
settlers, there was a fresh demand for enforced labor of a new type,
and the native tribes were raided in order to secure supplies of pearl
divers. Although through the voyages of explorers various widely
separated points on the mainland had been touched, no place had been
effectively occupied by settlement. Wherever efforts were made,
the native population, the Caribs, were found to have such warlike
qualities that no successful foothold could be secured. The climate
also proved fatal to Europeans. After Balboa made his celebrated
passage across the Isthmus, an expedition of 15 ships and 2000 men came
to occupy the land, but 600 of these died in a few months.No point yet visited by European adventurers had offered examples of
native civilization higher than the primitive standards attained by
the Carib and the Arawak. But in the interior, in the thick forests
of Central America, were scattered about the relics of an ancient
culture. In a triangular space including some of northern Yucatan,
Mitla in Oaxaca, and Copan in Honduras, there are the remains of sixty
communities distinguished by temples, tombs, statues, bas reliefs,
fragments of buildings, and deserted palaces. These are relics of a
race who at the discovery of America had lost their supremacy for many
generations. According to some reckonings, at least as early as the
twelfth century these celebrated dead cities were founded.The difficulty of historical research in reconstructing the records of
these aboriginal peoples is due partly to poor methods of transmission
and also to the fact that so many of the original documents were
lost at the time of the Spanish conquest and before. Chronological
reckonings were kept for the purpose of marking the days on which
tributes and sacrifices were due. To this were added the figures of
chieftains, the notices of tribal conquests, and such events as floods,
famines, and eclipses. All of this miscellaneous popular lore was
embodied in paintings, executed by a large class of artists, some of
whom were women, on paper or fiber rolls or on prepared skins. For
this picture-writing skins, oblong in shape and of great length, were
employed. Along with these “pinturas” there was handed down an oral
method of interpretation. Our knowledge of Mexican history has to be
derived from the surviving examples of these picture rolls and from the
traditional explanations which were taken down in writing at the time
of the entrance of the Spaniards into the country.The tradition existing in Mexico at this period told how the primitive
stock inhabiting the land were giants, many of whom had perished by
flood, fire, and earthquake. Then came a body of men who wished to
reach the sun, and for this purpose they reared a tower. The sun,
angered at the presumption of the earth-dwellers in aspiring to
share with the gods the dwellings in the heavens, summoned all of
the supernatural powers; the building was destroyed; and the guilty
mortals were scattered over the earth. A mythical legislator then
appears in Central America who teaches the people, the offspring of
the giants, the arts of civilized life. The basis of this folklore
may not unreasonably be ascribed to the finding of the bones of large
extinct animals and, on the site of the Central American ruined
cities, of mammoth statues of human beings. The residuum of truth
seems to be that the Mexicans of the Conquest were correct in their
common tradition that their ancestors had come from the north, and
that the country had been gradually occupied by successive swarms of
invaders who came south while they were still dependent on hunting
game for their food and were finally reduced to settled forms of life
by the cultivation of maize. The various tribes who took part in this
migration are called by the Mexican word “Nahuatlaca,” used to denote
those communities who were dependent on agriculture and followed a
nahua or rule of life dictated by a custom administered by hereditary
chiefs. At the beginning of the sixteenth century the Nahuatlaca had
reached the present limits of Costa Rica. That there were aboriginal
inhabitants is inferred from the mention of the Otomi, the Huaxtecs,
the Totonacs, and the Ulmecs, who at the time of the Conquest occupied
districts not overrun by the Nahuatlacan immigration.In the first stage of the southward movement the Toltecs take the
lead; it is stated that, being expelled from their own country, they
came from the region of the north by both land and sea. Their chief
center in their new land was Tollan, a pueblo which stands on a
tributary of the Moctezuma River, a stream which falls into the Gulf
of Mexico. This place seems to have been once a center of trade, for
the Toltecs had the reputation of being clever craftsmen. In addition
to knowledge of preparing skins and of manufacturing clothing and
articles of domestic use, they must have become familiar with various
metals and with the employment of stone for building. Colored stones
and crystals were used in their decorative work; from the coasts were
brought the colored shells with which they covered their buildings, and
the feathers which were woven into their tapestry. Besides this, they
had a reputation for the knowledge of medicinal plants. The ruins of
Tollan are extensive; as described by those who saw some of the still
extant buildings at the time of the Conquest, they must have been most
impressive. Sahogun mentions especially the Chalchiauhapan (On the blue
water) because it was built between the two forks of the river. There
were richly decorated apartments, four being more magnificent than the
rest. One was called the House of Gold, another the House of Green
Jade and Turquoise; a third room was covered with colored sea-shells
arranged as mosaics, the interstices being filled with silver; the
last room was decorated in red stones, combined with colored shells.
There were besides four rooms adorned with tapestry made of the plumage
of different colored birds. As with Selinus, a famous Greek city in
Sicily, the downfall of Tollan must have been sudden, for there was an
unfinished building seen in the ruins with remarkable pillars in the
form of rattlesnakes, and also a mound in process of construction to be
used as a foundation of a building of unusually large size. This fate
seems to have overtaken it some centuries before the Spanish conquest,
and was probably due to an insurrection among the subordinate pueblos.The name Toltec came to be used as a synonym for a builder in stone or
a worker of metals, and it was due to the influence of this race that
the other branches of the Nahuatlaca stock made their progress in the
civilizing arts. Not only do they stand out among other peoples of the
New World as prominent in the pursuit of useful arts and in artistic
achievement, but they deserve a place of honor because the deity they
worshipped, Suetzalcohuatl, was not propiatiated by sacrifices of
blood, but by offerings of maize, perfumes, and flowers. Probably many
of them migrated to the regions of Central America, where they were
able to preserve their own traditions. Here can be seen better than
in the neighborhood of their ancient capital the specimens of their
artistic skill. Some of the Toltecs of the dispersion took refuge at
Cholula, which at the time of the Conquest was the chief seat of Toltec
arts and religion, and also the center of the slave trade. Not far off
is the town of Tlaxcallan.The dissolution of the Toltec control was followed by a long period
marked by successive waves of migration. Some of these nomadic tribes
who described themselves as Chichimecs of the sun (Teo Chichimecs)
established themselves in the strong places of the mountains, and took
possession of Tlaxcallan, making it their center. In time this pueblo
and its neighbors became of great importance, emigrants spreading from
it over parts of Yucatan and Central America. Even at the time of the
Spanish conquest the territory which Tlaxcallan dominated, although it
was only forty miles in its greatest length and considerably narrower
in breadth, mustered 50,000 warriors.The spread of the Nahuatlaca race by their various emigrating swarms
brought them over all parts of the Mexican plateau, and also to the
coast both of the Atlantic and Pacific, but the center of their rule
lay in the narrow Valley of Mexico, probably once the crater of an
immense volcano surrounded by a girdle of mountains. There were fifty
pueblos in the valley placed on or near the four lakes which, by
changes in the distribution of land and water, had taken the place of
the one large body of water that had once filled the extinct crater.
Before the coming of the Nahuatlaca the district was occupied by the
Otomis, whose language is still spoken in the neighborhood of Mexico
City.When the migration took place, Tezcuco, situated on the northeastern
shore of the lake, became a dominant pueblo, and was at the head
of a considerable confederacy. On the western side of the lake was
another group of pueblos known as the Tecpanecs, who were rivals of
Tezcuco. Here there settled about the year 1200 a vagrant tribe of the
Chichimecs; the new arrivals were named by the Tecpanecs crane people
or Aztecs, probably from their habit of wading in the marshy shores of
the lake while engaged in fishing. The newcomers proved industrious,
and in the course of time reclaimed the marshy island, building on the
land two towns, the villages of Tenochtitlan (place of a prickly pear)
and Tlatelolco (place of a hill). According to Aztec folklore, when
they took possession of the island, they found on it a prickly pear
tree growing on a rock and on this rock they saw an eagle devouring a
snake. This fable is still recalled in the present arms of the republic
of Mexico.The two Aztec pueblos on the lake remained distinct communities until
1473, a fact which suggests their being built on separate islands,
according to the traditional account. By help of the Aztecs, who were
skilled in the art of war, the Tecpanec confederacy made great advances
in dominating the valley. There was a little contest with Tezcuco when
the confederates demanded from its people the usual tribute of cotton
cloth; Tezcuco was taken and handed over to the Aztecs as a reward for
their valuable services. The growing importance of the island pueblos
soon, however, aroused the jealousy of the Tecpanecs and they resolved
to suppress the two island communities by transferring the inhabitants
to the shores of the lake. In the war which followed, though many of
the people of the islands were at first reluctant to try conclusions
with their powerful neighbors, the counsels of their warlike leader,
Ischohuatl, prevailed. Azcapozalco, the center of the Tecpanec
confederacy was captured, and with this conquest, which took place in
or about the year 1428, Tenochtitlan or Mexico became the dominant
power in the valley.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'The island pueblos showed a statesmanlike policy in dealing with
their neighbors; Tezcuco was restored to something like an autonomous
position, and in the group of pueblos in the valley, of which the
island communities were now the head, an equitable distribution of the
tribute formerly collected by the Tecpanecs was made. Tezcuco also,
and Tlacopan, a Tecpanec pueblo, were given a specific district over
which to preside, and were allowed to pursue untrammeled their own
line of conquest. To secure the dominant power of Mexico, causeways
were built in three directions to the shore, and with other works
constructed on two of the lakes, by which the straits between the
lakes of Tezcuco and Xochimilco were bridged, a strong fortified place
came into existence which was practically impregnable. The warlike and
aggressive traditions of Ischohuatl were so well maintained throughout
the ninety-two years between the formation of the confederacy and the
advent of the Spanish invaders that large tracts of country outside of
the valley were turned into tributary regions.A considerable portion of this work of expansion was done by
Ischohuatl’s successor, his nephew Montezuma the First, who ruled over
Tenochtitlan for twenty-eight years (1436-1464). During his reign the
limits of Mexican rule were extended nearly to those formed by the
Spaniards, the area of conquest being decided largely by commercial
reasons. Wherever in the Pacific district there were honey, cacao,
tangerines, precious stones, copal gums, cinnabar, and gold, that
region was marked out for absorption. These Pacific regions extended
800 miles in length and, because of the value of their products, were
the most important of all the Mexican dominion. On the side of the
Gulf of Mexico the eastern part of the present state of Vera Cruz
was rendered tributary; from this district the most prized object of
exportation was the quetzalli feathers used for standards and for
warriors’ plumes. There was trade from Mexico with the Caribs on the
Gulf, for Columbus met, in 1502, a Carib vessel having a cargo of
cotton cloaks, tunics, skirts, Mexican swords, stone knives, bronze
hatchets and bells, pans for smelting bronze, and cacao. From the time
of Montezuma I to the reign of the second of the name, the sovereignty
was held by three brothers in succession. During this period there was
a revolt of the sister community of Tlatelolco, the suppression of
which brought to an end the long existing equality in the confederation
headed by this pueblo. Apart from this the boundaries of the tributary
area do not seem to have been enlarged.Altogether there are found in the roll of tributary pueblos 358 names
when Montezuma II was dominant chief (1502-1520). These were small
industrial settlements in all of which a particular kind of tribute was
prepared; some sent cotton cloths, others raw cotton, others timber
for fuel or building; from others came weapons, deerskins, tobacco.
The tributes were generally paid annually in prescribed quantities.
Under this system the great bulk of the population, the Nahuatlacan
peasantry, were condemned to a life of severest toil of all kinds
done in behalf of the warrior and priestly classes. The warriors,
too, every twenty days, had to take the field, partly as a military
exercise, partly also to provide the human sacrifices that, according
to their old elaborate Mexican ritual, had to be offered to the
gods. The priests took charge of the prisoners, prepared them for the
sacrifices, divided the flesh of the victims, and arranged their skulls
in the precincts of the temple, this being the method of keeping a
regular toll of the offerings. There were more commonplace tasks of the
priestly order, the Teopixqui, that must have filled up the intervals
between the frequent great sacrificial festivals. In each teopan, or
temple dedicated to a divinity, the sacred fire was kept ever burning;
besides, there was the regular offering of incense, four times a day,
at sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight. To keep up this sequence of
devotion and also the prescribed immolations, at stated intervals the
heavens were scrutinized with official vigilance day and night. At
midnight all those attached to the teopan were aroused for the solemn
offering of blood that took place in a penitential chamber, each
worshiper supplying his share of blood by tearing his own body with a
strap of aloe thorns.In their religious system the Aztecs, like the other members of the
Nahua stock, had reached, in a technical sense, a highly differentiated
standard. They had long left behind that stage of the lowest savage
life where there is no recognition even of spirits, those substantial
and active beings who are made responsible for the changes in the
material world that the savage cannot otherwise explain. When the
spirit is supposed to be composed, not of flesh and blood, but of some
ethereal matter the era of civilization begins. According to savage
belief the spirits are made in the image of a man, consisting of flesh
and blood like man, and also requiring, like him, nourishment of food
and drink. This principle took the widest extension in the Nahuatlacan
worship; with the development of tribal life and the organization of
confederacies there went hand in hand the regular provision of meat
and drink offerings organized on a very large scale to secure the
benevolence of the divinities. Various familiar forms of fetich worship
were employed. Probably before the fashioning of idols by the hand
of man natural objects such as plants, trees, mountains, and animals
were worshipped; for example, in Mexico there was a national annual
sacrifice to the mountains. In the frequent human sacrifices the victim
was slain with a stone knife, on a stone slab, while the neck and
limbs were kept in place by a collar and fetters made of stone. From
the maize plant developed some of the most important deities in the
Mexican religion. There was a long midsummer festival of eight days
devoted to this vegetable, one of the prime necessities of life, at
which one victim, a slave girl, was offered to the spirit dwelling in
the maize. At the end of the eighteenth century the idol before which
the sacrificial ceremony was performed was discovered in one of the
squares in Mexico, recalling the procession in which it was carried,
bound round with skulls, dead snakes, maize leaves, and ears. The toad,
as the offspring of water and the symbol of the water spirit, was an
object of veneration. The rabbit, as an animal considered totally
devoid of sense, was worshipped as a drink god, to whom offerings were
made that the worshipper might escape the deleterious effects of an
over indulgence in pulque. Like other people in the primitive stage of
culture the Mexicans venerated rivers and lakes as manifestations of
will.The common practice of worship of the dead prevailed also in Mexico,
where its existence is attested by the preservation of the skull,
or by the blocks of stone surmounted by enormous human heads which
invariably denote the distinguished dead, because the gods are always
represented with all their limbs. There was also a large heavenly
hierarchy, gods of the atmosphere and stellar powers, some being
associated with particular mountains, but the most important of all
was Tezcatlipoca the giver and sustainer of life, the symbol of the
wind, the bestower of life and death. Next to him came the sun god,
Huitzilopochtli. He being a living person was, as appeared from the
natural phenomena seen in the succession of the seasons and the change
from day to night, especially in need of food. His vitality frequently
shows signs of failing. It is therefore especially incumbent upon
man to help him in this struggle for existence. So necessary was the
maintenance of this principle of religious faith that the sun always
received a share of the human victims offered to the other divinities.
But all sorts of vegetable and animal life were offered to this needy
divinity, who seemed to the Mexicans to show such constant signs of an
impaired vitality. In the pictures of the Aztecs the rays of the sun,
significantly represented as long crimson tongues licking up blood,
constantly appear. The order of society was so regulated as to keep
the sun in full vigorous condition; hence the never ending slaughter
of human victims supplied by incessant warfare with neighboring
tribes to provide the food supply for the sun. If there had been
large animals in Mexico, these ghastly immolations of human victims
might not have stained the progress of the Aztec people, for it is an
established principle that the search for food is closely related to
the development of religion among primitive races.As the people of Nahuatlaca stock advanced economically and
politically, they applied the results of their experience to their
primitive tribal religion. Along with the system of tributes which
maintained the dominant pueblo, there were expeditions made for
securing the tribute to the sun god, called in the language of
religious imagery “the plucking of flowers.” As the service of the god
was connected with military expeditions, Huitzilopochtli was the Aztec
god of war, the tutelar divinity of the warrior class. Twice a year in
Mexico there were special rites in the building called the Abode of
the Eagles, where the warriors assembled to send a messenger to their
patron. In the principal court of the building there was a colossal
symbol of the sun, in the shape of a solar wheel sending forth rays of
gold. Before it was a great stone at the top of forty steps, called the
cap of the eagles; the middle of the altar was hollowed out to receive
the victim’s blood, and here the poor captive was brought dressed in
the colors of the sun. He carried a staff, a shield, and a bundle of
coloring matter, the purpose of which seems to have been to enable the
sun to decorate his face. Just before the immolation the victim was
addressed in the following words: “Sir, we pray you go to our god, the
sun, and greet him on our behalf; tell him that his sons and warriors
and chiefs, those who remain here, pray for him to remember them and
to favor them from that place where he is, and to receive this small
offering which we send him. Give him this staff to help him on his
journey and this shield for his defense, and all the rest you have in
this bundle.” Those who fell on the field of battle were believed, as a
reward, to be transported into the house of the sun, where they became
his servants and shared in his constant banquets.With the eclecticism common to all religions and that specially marks
its primitive type, an ancient god of the Toltecs, Quetzalcohuatl, also
a solar deity, was adopted as a member of the Aztec divine hierarchy.
According to tradition, this divine being left his abode in heaven for
the purpose of showing beneficence to mankind. From him man learnt the
arts of life, and while he was on earth the age of gold prevailed.
Unlike the other deities, his character was mild and kindly, for he
was described as being averse to war and sacrifice. Constantly crossed
in his purposes by wizards, he floated away on a raft. There was a
general belief that he would return and restore the reign of peace, an
anticipation which was popular among the tribes who felt the burden of
the Aztec domination. Each year, with an inconsistency not foreign to
higher forms of religion, human sacrifices were offered under the guise
of messengers sent to inform the benign Quetzalcohuatl of the need of a
speedy deliverance.As might have been expected, exaggerated estimates are given by the
early authorities of the number of human beings slaughtered in the
course of the year; but, in any case, it must have been great, for in
the small and poor region of Tlaxcallan from one pueblo 405 captives
were sacrificed at the chief feast of the local deity. Naturally, in
the dominant pueblo the proportions of the human victims offered to the
gods must have far exceeded these limits.Closely connected with the Aztec religion was the development of an
ingenious, if imperfect method of reckoning time. It was apparently
evolved independently, for in the Old World there was nothing like
it. The basis of time reckoning was the period of twenty days, and
each day of this division had a proper sign or name. The periodic
expeditions against neighboring hostile tribes were controlled by this
division, as were also the holding of markets and the arrangement of
tributes. There were eighteen of these divisions, which regulated the
various festivals of the religious year. For secular purposes the
360 day year was corrected by adding to it a period of five days, a
fractional part of the twenty-day period. On these supplementary five
days all public ceremonies ceased. The chronological system consisted
of a combination of great cycles, each of fifty-two years’ duration.
And each great cycle was divided into four smaller cycles of thirteen
years.The economic and political basis of Aztec life was the pueblo, or
tribal community, in which frequently each clan of the tribe had a
localized quarter, each provided with the temple of the particular
deity recognized by the clan as its protector. Through the wars
of conquest with weaker pueblos there had grown up a rudimentary
feudalism, according to which the distinguished warriors were
established in the subject pueblos as proprietors of the best lands
in them. The possession of these lands could descend to the sons or
might be alienated for the benefit of a distinguished chieftain. The
food supply of the country so controlled was regular, hence there was
no need of a nomadic life. Wealth was increasing, and the population
growing. Habits of industry were encouraged, with the result that the
principle of the division of labor to a certain extent existed. Some
forms of craftsmanship, too, were cultivated, specialized in particular
communities; for example, Cholula was famous for its potters, while
the art of the goldsmith was practised at Azcapozalco. Clothing was
manufactured, the houses and buildings were decorated internally,
and there was an elaborate cuisine. Montezuma’s meal is described as
consisting of thirty sorts of stews. He used chafing-dishes to keep
them warm, and he also drank chocolate and ate fruit as a second course.There was a system of customary law administered by qualified
officials, and, for controlling the conduct of the people, there
existed an extremely elaborate rule of life which implied discipline
and the recognition of social duties and family obligations. The
Aztecs had standards of value, but no coined money and no standards of
measurement, nor anything like an alphabet or even a syllabary. In the
“pinturas,” however, there were a few purely phonetic symbols.The darker side of Aztec rule is seen in the enforced human labor
exacted to supply the tributes in kind, and in the revolting system
of organized cannibalism, the outgrowth of their elaborate ritual.
Some of the neighboring tribes successfully resisted both these types
of oppression, while those who were too weak to do so depended on the
mysteriously predicted deliverance from their yoke. In any case, the
way for a rapid conquest had been well prepared.
II THE CAREER OF CORTEZ
In 1517 the governor of Cuba, Diego Velasquez, began to send some of
his subordinates to explore the coast of Yucatan. One of them brought
back ornaments and vessels of gold and also information as to the
extent and importance of the great native power in the interior of the
land. An expedition was then put in charge of Hernando Cortez, who for
eight years had been an adventurer in the New World. The new leader was
a native of Medellin in Estremadura, where he had been born in 1485.
He had received a good education, graduating as bachelor of laws, but,
after leading an irregular life at home, he had sailed for the West
Indies, where he had spent eight years, first in Hispaniola, then in
Cuba. Like other adventurers, he had taken part in Indian warfare and
had been a planter. Powerful interests worked against his appointment;
accordingly, when he left Cuba he was informed that Velasquez intended
to supersede him in the command. His fleet carried 110 sailors, 553
Spanish soldiers, 200 Indians, some artillery, and a valuable asset
for the conquest, sixteen horses.[Illustration: HERNAN CORTES.From a Drawing Taken from Life]On the 12th of March, Cortez’ squadron arrived at Potonchan, having
previously stopped at Cozumel to pick up Geronimo de Aguilar, who had
taken part in an earlier and unsuccessful expedition to the coast of
the continent. He had become a member of a native pueblo, had married
an Indian, and was especially useful because of his knowledge of the
Indian tongue. At Potonchan the inhabitants brought out provisions
in boats, but were not disposed to receive the newcomers in their
village; indeed, they asked them to accept the food,--bread, fruit, and
birds,--and take themselves off. Cortez arranged an ambush near the
pueblo and, according to the agreement, two hundred men under Alvarado
and Avila rushed upon the settlement when the natives came out a second
time to bring provisions. In the meantime the Spaniards on the ships
disembarked under the fire of their artillery. There was some sharp
fighting, and by the time the pueblo was taken most of the inhabitants
had fled to the highlands nearby. The dead were not counted, but there
were many wounded and a few captives. Perhaps the actual fighting men
on the native side in this first engagement were not more than four
or five thousand. Plenty of food was found in the place, but no gold.
There was soon another battle, in which eight hundred or a thousand
Indians were killed. Apparently they fell into a panic when they
confronted cavalry for the first time; “they thought the man and beast
were one thing.”Twenty-two days the expedition now halted, as the pueblo was well
supplied with provisions, and the enemy was active outside. Finally
the Indians, who were exposed to the prevailing bad weather and were
without food, sued for peace, making a rich present to Cortez. But this
was nothing, Diaz del Castillo naïvely says, in comparison with the
twenty women, who were distributed as booty to the Spanish captains;
one in particular was a prize--the celebrated Doña Marina, who spoke
the language of the Aztecs, and also, because she had been a slave
on the coast, knew the languages of Yucatan and Tabasco. As Aguilar
understood Tabasco there was made possible, through Marina, direct
communication with the people of the country. “It was a great beginning
for our conquest,” says the worthy Diaz.When Cortez received the natives’ peace offering, he was careful to
inquire where they had acquired the gold and jewels. They replied by
directing him to the setting sun, and mentioned the words Culchua and
Mexico. This was a sufficient indication, and on the 18th of April,
Cortez left Potonchan and in three days arrived at San Juan de Ulua.
Here the emissaries of Montezuma, who from the accounts he had received
through his messengers, was convinced that the Europeans were none
other than the famous divine being Quetzalcohuatl and his companions
returning by sea after a visit to the sun, greeted Cortez with
extraordinary honors.There was abundance of food,--chicken, maize, bread, and
cherries,--drinks of very good cocoa, and, more welcome still,
many pieces of gold, some well worked, and a large quantity of the
feathered drapery and jewels. Cortez represented himself as the
friendly ambassador of Charles V, sent on a special mission of peaceful
curiosity. His chief interest was concentrated on the gold, however,
for he particularly inquired of the Aztec Teuhtlilli who spoke for
Montezuma whether his master had gold. When he answered in the
affirmative, Cortez bluntly said, “Send me some of it.” In return for
the generous welcome given them the Spaniards amused themselves, in the
days following their disembarkation at San Juan, by showing the natives
their arms and bloodhounds and explaining how they meant to use them in
their passage through the country.The news of the manners of the mysterious strangers threw Montezuma
into a panic; he was more convinced than ever when he heard of the
rapacity and cruelty of the Spaniards that Cortez was nothing less than
Quetzalcohuatl, the description given being admirably suited to one
of the principal divinities of the Aztec theology. To the king’s mind
the sole remedy lay in incantations; he summoned therefore the most
experienced experts to devise powerful enchantments to keep the whites
from approaching the Aztec capital. The charms were inefficacious. At
his wits’ end, the Aztec overlord sent peaceful directions to all his
dependents.After the disembarkation at San Juan de Ulua the adventurers did not
pass their time in idle dreams; they found abundance of occupation
in collecting gold and precious stones, giving the natives in return
objects of small value. Fresh embassies presented themselves to Cortez,
not only with the usual presents, but giving useful information. Among
them was a representative of Ixtlilxochitl, the lord of Texcoco, who
spoke of the tyranny of Montezuma, who had killed his brother. He
welcomed the Spaniards as allies who would help him to avenge the
murder. Cortez saw in this an opportunity to encourage dissension among
the natives, by taking advantage of which he could make himself master
of both factions, and so control the country. He desired to found a
settlement at the place at which they had first touched land. There was
a division among his followers on this point; some of them regarding
his purpose of making himself the captain general of the new colony as
an act of disloyalty to Velasquez, the governor of Cuba. He met the
situation by putting the most obstinate of his opponents in chains, and
finally all the members of the expedition were won over by the generous
promises he made, although there was complaint at his proposal to take
for himself one-fifth of all the gold that might be gathered from the
natives.The colony Cortez succeeded in establishing received the name of Vera
Cruz, because they had reached the spot on Holy Saturday; the words
Villa Rica were added to mark the fertility of the surrounding country.
Visits were made to neighboring pueblos with profitable results.
At Cempoala twenty of the leading men, accompanied by their chief,
presented themselves; there were the usual valuable offerings, and
Cortez took care to promise his aid in defending and helping his new
acquaintances. The chief complained of the oppression of Montezuma,
explaining that his people had only lately been conquered and had
been deprived of much treasure. They were obliged to carry out his
orders, he said, because the Aztec was the lord of great cities, lands,
vassals, and armies of warriors. Before leaving the pueblo, Cortez
spoke of his philanthropic mission as the representative of the Emperor
Charles V, promising that after he had returned to his fleet he would
see that their grievances were remedied.The impression made by the benevolent stranger was so great that
at Cempoala 400 natives were offered by the chief of the pueblo as
pack-carriers--men of great endurance, the chronicler says, who could
carry fifty pounds weight five leagues. This was a great relief to the
Spaniards, who had hitherto been obliged to transport the valuables
they collected from the villages through which they passed on their
own shoulders in small sacks. Other pueblos were treated to the same
successful diplomacy.The more Cortez heard of the country, the more he was convinced that
the real objective of the expedition must be Montezuma and his capital.
The presents received by the adventurers and the tales they heard
showed that their journey must, if their hopes were to be realized,
have its termination in Mexico. When the second installment of presents
came from the Aztec capital, the astute commander remarked to some
of his men nearby, in admiration of the valuable articles so freely
placed in his hands, that the Aztec overlord must be great and rich.
“If God wills,” he said, “some day we shall have to go and see him.”
This pious aspiration fell on no unwilling ears, and the opportune
moment came sooner than even the most sanguine adventurer could have
hoped, for Cortez soon succeeded in forming an alliance with thirty
pueblos, contiguous to his own settlement, all of them ready to follow
him as their leader in an expedition which was to free them from the
burdensome yoke of Aztec despotism. The fighting force now available
must have been considerable, for we know that one pueblo, Quiahuistlan,
half a league distant from Vera Cruz, offered to supply 5000 men.In the meantime, a ship had arrived from Cuba with seventy Europeans
and nine horses. The expedition had now been three months in Mexico,
and the demand to push on to Montezuma’s city was general. Cortez
sent home an account of his experiences, in which he drew up a formal
accusation against the Cuban governor, Velasquez, fortifying his own
claims by a rich present in excess of the value of the royal fifth, the
statutory portion. “It is the first we have sent,” the commander said
to his comrades in excusing and explaining a generosity that had to
be collected from their hoards. This act of loyalty was an additional
stimulus to the adventurers, who saw in their march to the interior an
easy method of recuperating their losses. When the commissioners were
about to leave for Spain, some of Cortez’ men proposed to accompany
them. Cortez arrested them immediately. Two were put to death; one, a
pilot, was deprived of his feet, and the common seamen received each
two hundred lashes. Father Diaz would have been punished, too, had not
Cortez respected his habit. One of the victims who was executed was
Pedro Excudero, who had made charges against Cortez in Cuba before the
expedition sailed.To prevent the recurrence of such attempts at desertion and also to add
to his men the crews of the vessels, Cortez resolved to destroy the
fleet in the harbor, with the exception of one small boat which was
to carry the commissioners back to Spain. The proposal was arranged
not to come from the commander himself, because, if he had taken the
initiative, he might have been obliged to pay off the seamen out of his
own pocket. So, as Herrera, one of the adventurers, says, “if anyone
asked him to pay the money, he could retort that the advice was ours,
and that we were all involved in settling up the accounts.”Cortez knew that he would meet with no mercy at Velasquez’ hands;
his only chance, therefore, was to remain in Mexico, and that the
destruction of the fleet rendered certain. The daring plan was carried
out secretly at night by the master of one of the ships, an intimate
friend of the commander. The crews had been removed beforehand, and the
explanation made by Cortez’ envoy in Spain, Montejo, was that the ships
were old and on the point of foundering before they were scuttled.
This plausible statement was not more convincing than the rest of the
envoy’s argument, and the Royal Senate of the Indies condemned Cortez’
conduct as “contrary to righteousness and justice.” He had acted also
contrary to the commands of the governor of Cuba, who, in the meantime,
as the case was being discussed by the home authorities, asked that
capital sentence be passed. Cortez’ view finally prevailed because of
the fortunate outcome of his march, and in 1522 Velasquez was directed
not to send to New Spain any people or armed forces.After scuttling the ships Cortez returned to Cempoala to arrange for
the expedition. The chieftains of the pueblo advised that the route by
the way of Tlaxcala should be taken because the people of that place
were their friends and mortal enemies of the Aztecs. A start was made
on the 16th of August with 400 Spaniards, 15 horses, and 5 pieces of
artillery. In all the chronicles of the expedition there is a discreet
reserve as to the number of Indian allies. It seems to have been a
fixed policy to obscure this point. But the native contingent must have
been very large, for at each pueblo where the expedition sojourned one
hears of the acquisition of native warriors; at Ixtacamaxtitlan, a
small place, the chief gave 300 soldiers.On reaching Tecoac in Tlaxcala the invaders found that the attitude
of the people was distinctly hostile; in a preliminary skirmish
thirty warriors preferred to die rather than yield. The inhabitants
of the pueblo were then cut to pieces, as they refused to retire or
surrender. This was on the last day of August; the next day there was
a hot battle, in which the Spaniards seem to have been saved by their
native allies from destruction. Diaz del Castillo says that Cortez
thanked them profusely, and adds that the Spaniards were panic-stricken
by the wild shouts of their opponents. There was soon after another
battle, where the escape of the Spaniards was due to the existence of
dissensions in the Indian camp; the people of the pueblo refused to
stand by one another. Much damage was done in the second ranks of their
warriors by the fire of the artillery, but fifty of the Spaniards
were wounded, and one was killed, together with all the horses. Cortez
estimated his enemies at 149,000, plainly an impossible figure.Marauding expeditions were made against the defenseless pueblos, whose
fighting men were with the Tlaxcalan army. Women and children were put
to the edge of the sword without mercy, and the dwellings were burnt to
the ground. Fifty emissaries appeared on the 7th of September to ask
for peace, bringing with them presents of food and plumage ornaments.
Some were suspected of treachery, and all fifty, by Cortez’ orders,
had their hands cut off. The same day the Spanish camp was attacked by
10,000 men, warriors of the greatest valor, but even this danger was
repelled because the plan was known beforehand. The situation of the
Spaniards was almost desperate, for they had lost a hundred and fifty
of their number, and the survivors were worn out by anxiety and by
the constant physical fatigue. There was depression in the camp, some
proposing return to Vera Cruz, where the natives were friendly and
where help could be had from Cuba. But the commander’s spirit did not
falter. He sent three of his leading captives to Tlaxcala to ask for a
peaceful passage through their country to Mexico. After deliberation
the proposal was granted, although there was opposition, especially on
the part of the young chief Xicotencatl, who declared that in another
night attack he could take the camp and slay all the Spaniards. The
peace party carried the day, and Cortez entered the pueblo on the 23d
of September, receiving a royal welcome from the inhabitants, who gave
him valuable assistance and an enduring loyalty.After a month’s stay Cortez set out again with 5000 of these new
allies, “men much experienced in warfare,” as he himself allows. In
the neighborhood of Cholula he sent the inhabitants word, on receiving
their envoys, that they must become vassals of the Spanish crown,
saying if no reply were received within three days, he would attack
and destroy them. This menace had its effect, and great hospitality
was shown to the Spaniards and their allies. The streets and roofs
were crowded with people as the army entered the town, and they were
lodged in several large halls. The drain on the stores of the natives
was so great that on the third day they brought only water, rushes, and
wood. The scantiness of these offerings was to Cortez a demonstration
that the townspeople were disaffected and were plotting against their
guests. He issued an order therefore that all the chief men of the
place should assemble in the court of the temple of Quetzalcohuatl.
Suspecting no harm, they obeyed. To strike terror into the natives,
Cortez planned to murder the principal men and the priests; but there
were a great many other warriors of the pueblo in the inclosure so
crowded together they could not move. At the entrance were stationed
the Spaniards, who, at a given signal, rushed on the unarmed mass.
Some were mowed down; some burnt themselves alive, while others cast
themselves down from the temple pyramid, the raised platform on which
the altar was placed. In two hours, according to Cortez, 3000 met their
death. The massacre was continued in the streets for five hours; none
were spared until the pueblo was deserted. The carnage continued the
next day, gladly shared in by the Tlaxcalans, who had come in to take
their part of the pillage. It was the commander’s intention to demolish
the place altogether, and the cruel work took two days more.A fresh start was made on November 1st. The pueblos subsequently
visited by the expedition were terrorized by the massacre at Cholula,
and there was no stint of offerings. Cortez, too, being now in a
better temper because of the jewels, gold, and precious stones so
easily collected, did not forget to explain that he had come to save
the new vassals of the Spanish Crown from robbery and oppression. In
each pueblo he won the inhabitants over by his dexterous diplomacy and
pleasing manners, and they readily became his allies. No opposition
was encountered during the rest of the journey to Mexico. Meanwhile
the news of the massacre at Cholula had completely unnerved Montezuma;
“he humbled himself like a reed”; there was no thought of resistance.
He sent one of his chief men to impersonate him, as he was afraid to
meet Cortez himself. The deceit was soon discovered by the Indian
allies, and the substitute for royalty returned in confusion, leaving
rich presents behind. Montezuma consulted his magical experts again,
but the auspices and enchantments were no more favorable than before.
He now saw only death for all his people and for himself; with a fixed
fatalism he was convinced there was no escape. Tradition told him that
the people from the land of the rising sun were invincible.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'It was the eighth day of November when the Spaniards reached the
capital of the Aztecs. The army must have been imposing in its size,
and perhaps Montezuma’s religious scruples may have been reinforced by
others of a different character when he saw the number of his enemies
and revolted subjects who followed Cortez. Father Sahagun, a most
reliable authority, who visited Mexico in 1529, says that “hardly had
the rear guard moved from Ixtapalapan when the vanguard was already
entering Mexico.” The welcome was in harmony with the respect caused by
the size of the expedition and by the superstitious fears of the Aztec
overlord. A thousand of the principal men came out to greet Cortez
a half-league from the town. A quarter of a league from the palace
Montezuma presented himself with ceremonious pomp, accompanied by the
lords of the greater pueblos. He was supported by Cacomer, king of
Texcoco, and Cuitlahuatzin, king of Ixtapalapan, each holding him by an
arm on either side. All three were dressed alike, except that Montezuma
was shod. When Cortez dismounted to embrace him the two accompanying
lords forcibly prevented him from touching their master. Flowers were
offered according to the Aztec custom; likewise gold and precious
stones.After reassuring the Aztec ruler of his amicable intentions, Cortez
went with his suite to lodgings assigned in the treasury of one of the
temples, a residence selected because of their character as divine
beings. Montezuma spoke to Cortez of the prophecy of the return of
Quetzalcohuatl, expressed his willingness to become the vassal of the
great lord of the land of the rising sun; and repelled the charges made
against him by the people of Tlaxcala and Cempoala. He made, too, a
special point of denying the stories of having houses with golden walls
and of being served with gold furnishings and vessels. “The houses,”
he said, “which you see are stone and chalk and earth; it is true
that I have some things of gold left me by my ancestors; all that I
have do you take whenever you want it.” The offer was made effective
immediately. Cortez had received already many different jewels, much
gold and silver and feathers, and five or six thousand pieces of cotton
goods, very rich and in divers manners woven and worked. After the
interview rich presents of gold were made to the commander, as well as
to the captains and to each of the soldiers.The Spaniards kept watchful guard in spite of the sumptuous welcome;
the soldiers were restless and desired to sack the town. Their attitude
did not escape the attention of the natives, who began to suspect their
motives in remaining in the city. Food commenced to give out, and the
horses suffered and also the dogs. In a short time the men did not
scruple to sack some of the dwellings near Montezuma’s palace; they
showed also little respect for the native women, many of whom had shut
themselves up in terror at threatened maltreatment.It was a well-known and settled policy on the part of the Spaniards in
their conquests in the Antilles to seize the native chiefs in order to
reduce the members of the tribe to submission. This is made clear in a
letter from several Dominican friars, written home as early as 1516,
when the practice is noticed. In mentioning it, they explain that the
Indians are a people who love their lords much and are very loyal to
them. This strategy was now employed with complete success by Cortez.
He determined to force Montezuma to take up his residence in the
Spanish quarters by use of fair words, then to threaten him immediately
with death if he tried to escape from captivity. As an excuse for
putting this daring program into execution, Cortez, who entered the
palace accompanied by his captains, after the usual friendly welcome,
charged Montezuma with responsibility for the death of two Spaniards
at Nautlan. Cuauhpopoca, the local chief, it seems, had caused them to
be executed because of their offenses and excesses. Some time passed
in discussing the charge which the Aztec monarch, of course, denied.
Cortez’ comrades wished to hasten proceedings by killing the Aztec at
once. Finally Montezuma, completely terrorized, agreed to accompany
Cortez, and also followed his direction that he should tell his people
that the step was taken voluntarily at the advice of his priests.The chief of Nautlan, his son, and fifteen of the principal men of the
pueblo were summoned to the capital by Montezuma. Cortez ordered them
to be burnt; at the same time directions were given that all the arms
in the city should be collected. Fifteen cartloads in all were to be
burnt with the prisoners. Before the execution they confessed that they
had acted by order of Montezuma. Cortez put his prisoner in chains, and
this outrage was allowed to pass unavenged, for the Aztec lords feared
that their ruler would be slain. The timorous monarch told his subjects
that what he was enduring in the Spanish quarters had divine sanction.
Having the king in his possession, Cortez made detailed inquiry as to
the location of gold and silver mines. Much gold was collected, and,
whenever there was resistance to the orders from the capital, the
chiefs who refused to give up their possessions were treated as rebels
to their overlord, and either killed on the spot or imprisoned after
being summoned to the capital by orders issued through Montezuma.Cortez was delighted at the willing compliance of the king in playing
the rôle of a puppet in his hands, and he wondered because “great lord
as he was, that being a prisoner as he was, he was so much obeyed.”
On his own initiative, Montezuma addressed his chieftains, telling
them that the Spaniards were sent by Quetzalcohuatl, and begging them
to be obedient to Cortez in every respect, urging them to accept
their position of vassalage to Spain. This was the signal for another
great collecting expedition among the Aztec feudatories, the chief
contributor being Montezuma himself. The chronicler’s powers of
description are exhausted in enumerating the wealth that poured into
the hands of the eager adventurers. There was no scruple in taking what
was left after the regular tribute of vassalage had been paid.The commander, however, was very unwilling to proceed to the
distribution, and when he could resist his soldiers’ demands no
longer, it was found that the greater part of the three and a half
million dollars’ worth of metal had been retained by the leader and
the captains. He met their complaints by telling them that they all
would be very prosperous and rich, because they would be the masters
of rich cities and mines. As a more practical argument, he went among
the soldiers giving them secretly gold ornaments, and making individual
promises of reward.Meanwhile the rapacity of the adventurers and their open display of
their wealth did not bring so much odium upon them as their forcible
efforts to convert the natives. A Christian chapel was placed in the
chief temple, an action which seems to have contributed to destroy the
illusion among the people that there existed some relation between
the newcomers and their god Quetzalcohuatl. The undisguised enmity
soon came to a head in plans for a revolt that included a general
massacre of the Europeans. When information of the plot was conveyed
to Montezuma, who seemed worried at the fate of his strange guests and
advised their leaving the city, Cortez spoke of the destruction of his
ships and told the king that, when ships were prepared, the latter must
go with them to see their emperor. Workmen were sent to Villa Rica to
prepare the vessels, but it was probably with no serious intent beyond
the purpose of deceiving the prisoners.This was the state of affairs after five months’ residence in Mexico,
when news came that Spanish ships were off the coast, 16 vessels,
large and small, 1400 soldiers, 80 horses, and 20 pieces of artillery.
When the envoys landed, they summoned the captain of Vera Cruz to
accept as superior officer Narvaez, who had been sent by Velasquez
to take possession of the country. The four Spanish envoys were
hurried off as prisoners under an escort of natives who, by forced
marches night and day, reached Mexico in four days. Cortez, with
characteristic diplomacy, excused the rude behavior of his lieutenant.
Indeed, adequate reparation was made, not only by smooth speeches,
of which Cortez was past-master, but by the more telling arguments
of gold strips and ornaments. They, in turn, told all they knew of
the expedition of Narvaez, and regained the coast, won over by the
munificence and the amicable manners of the commander.No time was lost in heading off Narvaez’ expedition from entrance into
the interior. Cortez took most of his men and probably a large force of
the native allies sufficient to block Narvaez’ march to the capital.
Only 130 Spaniards were left in Mexico under the command of Alvarado.
While Narvaez was sojourning at Cempoala despoiling the neighborhood of
the few valuables that remained there after Cortez’ march, one of the
ecclesiastics from Cortez’ army was sent to visit the rival camp. He
showed much dexterity in winning over important men-at-arms, especially
those of the artillery, by a judicious distribution of gifts, though
outwardly he made loud profession of devotion to Narvaez. The work of
this skilled emissary was made the easier because Narvaez kept all the
spoil he collected for himself; the contrast was not left unnoticed by
the men whom the commander had won.When the work of undermining Narvaez’ men had been completed, the
Friar Olmedo found it easy to break off negotiations and return to
his own camp. There was now little difficulty in settling the affairs
between the two captains without bloodshed; Narvaez’ men were ready
to abandon him. Cortez, as he explains in a letter to Charles V,
after drawing near to Cempoala with his army, entered Narvaez’ camp
with a few followers by night and, before he was observed, took his
rival prisoner. There was only a little fighting; two were killed by
artillery fire in preventing those who wished to rescue Narvaez from
entering a tower where he had his quarters. This strategy seemed to
Cortez the best way “to avoid a scandal,” but less satisfactory to his
men was the division of booty found in the camp. Cortez gave it all
to Narvaez’ men. “They were many and we were few,” Diaz del Castillo
regretfully explains; “Cortez feared that they might kill him and his
small band of men-at-arms.”With the advent of this new army of marauders in the country there
appeared a plague of smallpox, a disease hitherto unknown. It made
frightful ravages, and its effects were compared by the Indians to
those of leprosy. No mention is made of the epidemic by Cortez; he was
too alarmed at the news which came from Mexico to heed the sufferings
of the native population, who were dying like cattle. While he had
been so successful on the coast, his garrison in the capital had
been attacked; their quarters had been partly burned and undermined,
and Cortez was afraid that all the treasure would be lost, his men
massacred, and the city sacrificed. No word had come from Montezuma; it
seemed that the worst must have happened.The difficult situation in which Alvarado was placed was due to his own
brutality. Before Cortez had left the city, he had given permission
that the festival of the god Toxcatl should be celebrated with the
accustomed ceremonies. Alvarado added as further conditions that they
should bear no arms nor offer human sacrifices. This festal occasion
lent itself readily to a repetition of the butchery of Cholula, and
some authorities go so far as to think that Cortez had given secret
commands for the massacre before he set off for the coast. While the
chiefs, warriors, and other leading men, more than 1000 in number,
were solemnly dancing in honor of their god in the court of the
temple, unarmed and covered with gold ornaments and jewels and singing
as they moved about, half the men of the Spanish garrison entered
and ranged themselves around the wall, after closing the entrances
to the courtyard. The Indians, thinking they had come in as curious
spectators, made no break in the ordinary ritual; suddenly the dancers
and the spectators were set upon, and the patio of the temple was soon
filled with dismembered heads, arms, and legs. The court was soon
nothing but a human shambles. Some tried to escape by climbing over the
side walls or by rushing up the temple steps; others feigned to be
dead; only a few saved themselves.The massacre lasted an hour, and, carefully planned as it must have
been, no hitch occurred during its progress. The people outside finally
got news of what was happening and, picking up their weapons, they made
savage attacks on the Spaniards, forcing them back to their quarters.
Alvarado himself was wounded on the head. Finding refuge, the Spaniards
barricaded themselves as well as they could, and the Indians turned to
bury their dead, an operation which took many days on account of the
elaborate ceremonial required by the dignity of those who had perished.
After the funeral ceremonies, the Mexicans returned impetuously to the
attack on the Spanish quarters.It would have gone hard with Cortez’ men if Montezuma had not
interfered in their behalf. Speaking from the roof of the building
where he was kept a prisoner, he gave orders to the Aztec warriors
to stop the fight. Cortez had heard of the massacre from both sides,
as Montezuma had sent to him envoys to complain of Alvarado’s wanton
slaughter in the temple. He promised to do justice when he arrived,
and also spoke, as a proof of his peaceful temper, of the small force
he was bringing back with him. As a matter of fact, when he re-entered
the city there were over 1000 Europeans and many allies with him; in
Tlaxcala alone he enlisted the services of 2000 men. No opposition was
made to this formidable force taking up their old quarters.It was strange that Cortez, who was usually quick to punish any
contravention of his orders, took no account of the massacre. He omits
mentioning it in his letters to Charles V, and it is not surprising
that Friar Sahagun reports that Cortez approved of the crime and told
Alvarado he had done well. In the disturbed conditions in the city no
market was held, and the Spaniards were no longer provided with food.
Montezuma excused the omission because of his imprisonment. Threatening
words were spoken by Cortez, and from this time his prisoner ceased to
exert any influence to prevent the revolt against the invaders.A messenger sent out to Vera Cruz returned to his comrades with the
news a half hour later that the whole city was up in arms. Even a group
of 200 Spaniards could make no headway through the streets. The Indians
faced the artillery in close array, and as fast as they were mowed
down, the gaps were filled up by others. They fought with a desperation
which caused wonderment even from men in Cortez’ army who had served
against the Turks. Constructions of wood were made to protect the
Spaniards from the showers of stones that poured down on them from
the housetops, while they tried to clear the streets covered with
barricades. But they could make no progress, and finally they withdrew
to their quarters, pursued by the Aztecs, who entered the palace in the
face of the desperate resistance of the Europeans. They threatened to
leave no Spaniard alive, yet they begged as suppliants for their lord
Montezuma to be given back to them.Though there are conflicting details given of the Aztec attack on the
Spanish quarters, there is not much doubt but that Montezuma had been
killed on the morning of the 27th of August, the day the wooden engines
were first used. The monarch was no longer of any use now that he had
refused to keep the revolt in check. There are different accounts of
the murder, but there seems a fairly general agreement that Montezuma
was stabbed to death.As there was no longer any hope of defending their quarters
successfully, Cortez tried to save himself and his men by a ruse. The
dead body of the Aztec ruler was taken up on the roof, covered with a
large shield so that the fact that it was a corpse could not be seen
clearly. Then one of the feudatories, the lord of Tlaclolco, addressed
the crowd and bade them, as if speaking in the presence of his master,
to give up the attack on the Spaniards, because, if they persisted, he
was afraid he would be killed. Little impression was made; injurious
words were spoken against the vacillating and effeminate ruler,
supposedly still alive before them. There was a volley of arrows, and
some say the body was struck by a stone. This is the basis of a story
circulated purposely by Cortez and others that the monarch had died
from the wounds received on the roof, where he had gone voluntarily to
speak to his people. It was a dangerous thing for Cortez to confess to
the murder, for Montezuma, be it remembered, had accepted the position
of a vassal of the Spanish crown. When the Aztecs showed no sign of
taking a peaceful attitude, Cortez himself tried the plan of addressing
them from the roof, but his diplomacy was of no avail. The only
conditions offered were withdrawal from Aztec territory; as long as he
stayed in the city, the Aztecs said, they would keep up the fight.Further essays at street combats showed this to be no idle threat;
forty-six Spaniards were killed and persistent attempts were made to
pull down the walls of their quarters, while missiles of all kinds were
directed on the defenders day and night. In order to bring some relief
to this perilous position, Cortez sent one of the prisoners to announce
the death of Montezuma, and offered to give up the body, knowing that
the burial ceremonies would keep his enemies occupied for several
days. But the animosity of the people was not to be diverted from
their prey. Cortez was afraid that the one causeway, that to Tlacopan,
would be destroyed and the sole means of escape cut off. His men were
discouraged; indeed, those who had belonged to Narvaez’ expedition were
in a state of mutiny.One of the Aztec priests and other leading men previously held as
prisoners were sent to ask permission for the Spaniards to leave on
condition that all the gold should be given up. Timbers were prepared
to place across the ditches near the causeway, and a plan of escape
was mapped out for the Europeans and their allies. The treasure was
carefully guarded by the allies, but before the night appointed for the
retreat all the Aztec prisoners were put to death. The soldiers also
found a large quantity of gold which they divided among themselves.
The exit from the city began just before midnight; there was a severe
thunderstorm which kept the Europeans from being observed until they
got past the first ditch; here they were seen by a native woman who was
drawing water there. She gave the alarm, and before the second ditch
was reached the Mexican warriors had gathered to annihilate their
enemies. There was immediately a panic, and those who were carrying the
gold were forced into the ditch. Diaz remarks laconically, “The gold
killed them and they died rich.”The only Europeans saved were those who carried small amounts of gold.
On the mass of Indian allies drowning in the ditch the Spaniards threw
their loads; using this living embankment a few of them made their
way to safety. Everyone looked out for himself, and when Cortez was
reproached for deserting his men, he replied that it was a miracle
that anyone had crossed the causeway alive. It was some time before
Alvarado, with the miserable surviving rear-guard of seven soldiers,
all in a sad plight, reached the main body of the army at Tlacopan.
(August, 1520.)As long as they were in Aztec territory, there was little chance of
escaping annihilation, for the disconsolate army after their night
journey were set upon by the warriors of the neighboring pueblos. Their
Tlaxcalan allies guided them along devious trails until they reached
Totoltepec, where the fugitives found some temporary security in a
temple, which they were glad to use as a fortress. Fortunately they
were not actually pursued by the main body of the Aztec fighting men,
who remained behind to collect the gold and jewels cast aside by the
Spaniards, and to spoil the dead. Besides, a number of Spaniards had
either by choice or by necessity remained in the city. According to one
authority not all of Cortez’ soldiers were acquainted with the plan
for the night journey; others preferred not to desert their treasures.
It is computed that 270 Europeans kept up the fight in the city and
then surrendered. During the rest of the retreat there were some sharp
skirmishes, and because of their fatigue and discouragement the army’s
power of resistance was soon exhausted. Thanks to their native allies,
however, they were brought finally to a place of safety in the friendly
pueblo of Tlaxcala. The losses had been terrible, nearly 1000 men had
perished, besides 4000 of the Tlaxcalans and other natives. At Tlaxcala
there was much mourning for the great calamity which had robbed the
place of its best warriors, but there was no hesitation in offering
Cortez their continued support in resuming the war against the Aztecs.Cortez was careful to give instructions to his men to treat the
inhabitants with consideration and not to rob them of their property.
These orders did not cause so much dissatisfaction to the survivors as
Cortez’ high-handed procedure in appropriating for himself whatever he
could find of the gold that had been saved in the panic of the retreat.
Many of the Spaniards spoke of returning to the coast to sail back to
Cuba. Cortez’ iron will now stood him in good stead; he quieted his own
men, and arranged to start immediately a campaign against Mexico by the
help of the Tlaxcalans, promising as the price of their aid a part of
all the conquests he made and various privileges and exemptions from
tribute.This offer proved an attractive one not only to the Tlaxcalans but
to other natives who saw a further chance of securing their freedom
from their Mexican overlords. Over 100,000 men were collected, either
by promises or by methods of terrorism; any pueblo that resisted
was sacked and the inhabitants massacred. Tepeacac, the center of
resistance, was taken; its men were put to death, and the women and
children set apart as slaves. As time went on, various individual
adventurers appeared off the coast, and by degrees the losses in
Europeans, in artillery, and in horses were made up. This good fortune
caused so much satisfaction to the veterans of Cortez’ army and their
commander that he resolved to undertake the seemingly hopeless task of
besieging Mexico itself. Additional re-enforcements and the necessary
war supplies were brought from Hispaniola, and in order to attack the
Aztec capital in its most vulnerable point brigantines were prepared on
the lake, since it was realized that it was impossible to force now an
entrance over the causeways.By the end of December all was ready. The Europeans numbered not quite
700 men, while the native contingent is placed by some at 150,000. From
Tlaxcala, 10,000 were asked for, but many more volunteered. As the army
proceeded, they found no great difficulty in occupying the places on
their route. Some, like Texcoco, had been partially deserted by the
inhabitants, who had the forethought to remove their goods. In disgust
the Spaniards burnt the town and its palace where all the ancient
records in picture scrolls of the Aztec kingdom were preserved. The
ravages of the smallpox weakened the Aztec resistance, and among those
who died was the implacable enemy of the Spaniards, Cuitlahuac, the
brother of Montezuma, who had been chosen as his successor. His death
at the end of November was a loss hard to repair. Even Diaz speaks of
him as “a valiant man and very prudent.”As their next chieftain they selected Cuauhtemoc, a cousin of
Montezuma, a young man who, during the period of the Spanish occupation
of Mexico, had distinguished himself by his active opposition to it.
He had taken a leading rôle in the revolt that had brought about the
evacuation of the capital, and he now set forward upon the work of
defense with great intelligence. Orders were sent to the dependent
pueblos to unite in repelling the European invasion, and the tribute
was remitted. Care was taken to collect treasures and arms, and
Mexico itself was placed in a state of defense by the construction of
intrenchments and ditches. Cuauhtemoc’s plan of campaign consisted in
concentrating all the available forces in the capital, yet offensive
tactics were skilfully applied. His hand was seen when the Spaniards
occupied Iztapalapa; here the inhabitants deserted the pueblo, and
while their enemies were peacefully enjoying the spoil and resting in
their quarters, the sluices were opened, and had not the natives of
Texcoco warned Cortez in time all would have been drowned.Desultory warfare continued for a time on the shores of the lake,
Cortez’ policy being to exact vengeance for the hostility of the lake
pueblos during the retreat. Many were razed to the ground and burnt.
But strenuous operations did not begin until the brigantines were
finished. For their construction Cortez was indebted to the skill and
industry of the people of Tlaxcala, who at their own expense cut the
wood, and transported it over mountainous defiles by bad roads to their
own pueblo, where it was cut into shape for the vessels. Thence the
pieces were carried eighteen leagues overland to Texcoco on the lake,
where, fastened together, they were transformed into ships ready for
navigation.Futile attempts were made by the Aztecs to set fire to this navy, for
they recognized the danger of an attack from the water, but there was
no thought of surrender. Untiringly, night and day, they prepared for
the siege, making new weapons to meet the attacks of cavalry, and
constructing barricades in the streets. The Spaniards also had to do
much preliminary work to enable the fleet to get into deep water; 8000
Indians were constantly employed in digging a channel from the shore
sufficient to accommodate the draught of the brigantines.All was ready on the 28th of April, 1521. The brigantines were manned
with European troops and artillerymen; but as usual the mass of the
army was made of native auxiliaries, probably underestimated by Cortez
at 80,000 men. Altogether the Spanish nucleus numbered about 1100, half
of them lately come to join the veterans. Efforts were made to arrange
terms of peace, but the Aztecs refused to listen to Cortez’ complaints
of bad treatment and disloyal conduct on the part of his late hosts.At every point of the advance to the city, Cortez encountered stubborn
enmity. There was fighting both on the lake and on the shore, that
showed the temper of the people. The brigantines were surrounded by
a flotilla of canoes as they proceeded on their way; but it was an
unequal combat because the frail canoes of the Aztecs were exposed to
the gunfire of the ships. Under the protection of the brigantines a
landing was effected on the causeway. Step by step, the defenders were
forced back towards the town; as long as they fought on the causeway
they were exposed to the raking volleys of the guns on the brigantines.It was a long, tedious process to take the many barricades of the city,
and even when the principal street was reached the determined onslaught
of the Aztecs forced the Spaniards back to the causeway bridges. No
real ground was gained in these first skirmishes, although there was a
concerted plan between Cortez and his lieutenants that they should make
for the center of the city at the same time. While the siege was being
resisted with such desperation, the straits of the Aztecs induced the
neighboring pueblos to send out large contingents of men to break the
power that had so long kept them in bondage. Cortez notices especially
the support given him from Texcoco both in men and in provisions; they
kept on the lake 1000 canoes going and coming with supplies, and 32,000
warriors.In order to starve the city out, the water supply had been cut off
before the siege began, and it was hoped that by guarding the causeways
no food could be brought in. Much skill was shown by the Aztecs in
overcoming these difficulties; they sent out many canoes by night, a
flotilla of specially large canoes filled with warriors who did not
hesitate to grapple with the brigantines. One they captured, and they
inflicted heavy losses on the equipment of others. The resourcefulness
of the defenders was worthy of the skilled campaigners of Europe; but
the problem of the food supply could not be solved by deeds of heroism,
and famine was more destructive than the weapons of their enemies. They
faced not only the actual distress from scarcity of supplies but also
the desertion of the city itself by large numbers of warriors who could
not be fed within the walls.The methods of warfare on both sides were worthy of the combatants.
Whenever the Spaniards or their allies were taken prisoners, they were
treated as victims for sacrifice and offered up in the various temples
of the gods with ordinary ceremonial rites. The Spaniards, whenever
they entered the streets, burnt and destroyed everything within reach,
temples and houses. The rage of the Aztecs at the destruction of all
they held dear showed itself in their furious attacks on their enemies
as they drew back at nightfall to their camp outside.There was no thought of coming to terms, although the losses were heavy
and the besieging force under Cortez alone was more than 100,000 men,
and his flotilla of canoes was 3000. The chief aim of the Spanish
ruler was to take the market-place, and plans for a general assault
were arranged, now that the blockade of the city was strictly kept.
From this center it was hoped all the streets could be cleared. The
large number of allies who each time the town was assaulted swarmed
over the roofs of the houses and made light of all other obstructions,
seemed to promise a speedy termination of the struggle. But before,
in the general attack the inclosure of the town was reached, the
Aztecs in canoes and on the various land approaches, which had now
been partially destroyed, made an unexpected sally. There was a call
to arms sounded from the apex of one of the principal temples, the
ritual drum being beaten whose tones could be heard at a distance of
two or three leagues. Instantly, as the Indians came rushing upon them,
the Spaniards were thrown in a panic, and made a precipitate retreat.
Cortez was himself in danger and would have been killed, had not his
enemies made strenuous efforts to take him alive in order that he might
be kept for a sacrificial offering. None of the other captains fared
better; Alvarado’s men narrowly escaped destruction.Many European prisoners were made, and from their camp the Spaniards
could watch their comrades being offered up to the sanguinary deities
of the Aztec religion. They were pierced with stone knives and their
palpitating hearts were drawn out as they lay recumbent on the stone
altars that capped the temple pyramids. At the same time the men in the
camp had to listen to the threats of their foes who, close at hand,
promised them the same fate as their comrades. There was no inclination
at this point on the part of Cortez and his men to resume the fight;
orders were given to restrict operations to the defense of the camp.
But the temper of the native allies was not affected by the defeat. The
Tlaxcalans especially took the lead in harassing their enemies, while
the Spaniards kept to their quarters. They also suggested a plan by
which the remaining supplies of food and drink might be cut off.This gradual process of attrition had its natural effect on the powers
of resistance of the Aztecs. Cuauhtemoc was forced to cover up the
losses in his army by disguising the women in the city as warriors.
Standing on the flat roofs of the houses they were easily taken to be
male warriors, and at closer quarters the Spaniards found them to be
as brave as the men. Cortez, indeed, tried to induce his opponents to
see how desperate their case was. His offers of peace were rejected;
when envoys were sent it was always a signal for renewed attacks on the
three Spanish camps.After consultation with his captains Cuauhtemoc resolved to die
fighting with his people rather than let them become the slaves of
the Spaniards. The chief food of the inhabitants now was the green
vegetation growing on the lake shallows, and they drank the saline
water from the same source because fresh water was no longer to be had.
Numerous must have been the victims of hunger and thirst and pestilence
in the Aztec quarters, and great were the losses in the continued
combats with an enemy far stronger, whose own losses were being made
up by uninterrupted accessions of strength, while there was the whole
countryside open from which supplies kept pouring in. It is significant
that the success of the Aztecs in blocking the general assault of their
capital made no impression outside. So far as we know, no attempts were
made to break the Spanish investing lines, nor, on the other hand, did
the failure to take the town in any way stop the movement to throw off
the Aztec yoke which was plainly the prime motive on the part of the
natives in helping the Europeans to take Mexico.The siege had now lasted forty-five days; it was time, therefore, to
make a radical change in the primitive methods of attack hitherto
followed by Cortez, methods that recall the Homeric accounts of the
siege of Troy. Each day there was hot fighting in the streets or on
the lake where the Aztec canoes gathered about the brigantines. At
nightfall there was a general return to the camp. The new plan was to
destroy all the houses in the portion of the streets where the daily
fighting took place. As the horsemen charged, the space was cleared
and the work of destruction began. On the exposed part by the lake
the brigantines and the canoes of the allies were able to do much
effective damage. The scale of the operations is indicated in one of
Cortez’ letters, where he speaks of using in this kind of fighting
150,000 warriors. Under these conditions, where each day ground for
the next stage of occupation of the town was secured, the great
market-place was taken.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'Finally the Aztecs were confined to an eighth part of their capital;
there was no bread to be had; nothing but fetid water to drink; and a
diminishing supply of defensive weapons. Cortez himself reports that
the Aztecs stood on the housetops, covering themselves with their
cloaks but without weapons. The streets and the houses were filled with
dead bodies. On the 13th of August the signal for the final attack was
given. Crowded together, without arrows or even stones and sticks to
defend themselves, the Aztecs were mowed down by the Spanish gunfire.
It was a disappointment to Cortez to have to use such extreme measures;
largely, it appears from his own words, because there would be no spoil
to be taken. Most of the houses had been destroyed, and the people
threw their wealth into the lake before they perished.The sufferings of the besieged made an impression even on the hardened
feelings of the Spanish commander. The last fights in the city and on
the lake took place amid scenes of horror; everywhere were dead bodies;
on the lake they were heaped up around the combatants, and could be
seen floating about as the canoes kept up the unequal conflict with the
Spanish brigantines. Diaz reports that all the houses were filled with
dead Indians; there was nothing green to be found; the inhabitants had
even eaten the bark off the trees.The end came when the cannon, at Cortez’ signal, began to fire on the
mass of unarmed Mexicans, too weak to move, stretched out one upon the
other, dying heroically, still even in their extremity, as Cortez says,
“never asking for peace.” As the artillery seemed slow in carrying on
the work of destruction, the brigantines with the European soldiers and
the allies were brought up and ordered to fall upon the remnant of the
Aztec warriors, who were either slain on the spot or cast into the
water from their last place of refuge.Cuauhtemoc fled from the city in a large war-canoe, and the Spaniards
gave chase. When overtaken he first prepared to sell his life dearly,
but seeing his wife and other women in the boat, rather than expose
them to risk he gave himself up and was conducted to Cortez, who spoke
in a friendly way and praised his valiant defense of his capital,
promising at the same time that he should be allowed to rule his people
as he had done before. The capture of the Aztec chieftain took place on
the 13th of August, 1521, the day that Mexico fell into the hands of
the Spaniards.The losses of the Aztecs in the final battle are set down as 40,000;
many chose to die by throwing themselves and their wives and children
into the lake rather than surrender. At the close of the siege there
followed scenes of pillage of the usual type, with no pretense at
discipline. The actual treasure seized was small, and to increase the
disappointment, no trace could be found of the lost gold and silver
which had been abandoned during “the mournful night” of the previous
year. The supposed explanation was that it had been carefully hidden.
Accordingly, Cuauhtemoc and others of high rank with him who, like
himself, were captives, were tortured by fire. But no revelations were
made, and the amount of gold distributed to the soldiers was small,
only five pesos to a horseman and less to a foot-soldier. The native
allies were paid off even more cheaply; they departed for home taking
with them promises of future land grants.Cortez’ plans for reconstructing the city were put into operation
immediately after the end of the siege. All the temples and great
houses that survived during the street fights were removed. In order
to make the conversion of the people to Christianity easier, the
records of their past were obliterated. In a few years all traces of
the complex Aztec society, with its divisions into nobles and priests
and warriors, were lost. But at least the native population in Mexico
did not meet the fate of those in the isles of the Antilles: the stock
was a hardier one and the systematic working of the mines did not
begin until twenty-five years after the conquest, when, owing to the
propaganda of Las Casas, protective measures were enforced. Cortez
introduced European grains and took care to repair the losses in the
food supply produced by the devastation of the conquest.Incapable of reconciling himself to the humdrum life of peaceful rule
after his years of adventure, the commander could not endure to see his
lieutenants penetrating into the unknown regions of the south, while
he stayed behind receiving their reports of immeasurable treasure. In
October, 1524, he set out for Honduras with a few Europeans and a large
number of Indian allies. Among his companions were Cuauhtemoc, the
dethroned Aztec overlord, and many of his nobles and chieftains. The
march was through difficult country filled with dense woods, mountains,
and morasses. The expedition suffered from the heat, and had to endure
lack of water and food as well as perils from enteric fever. Cuauhtemoc
and the Aztec lord of Tlacopan were charged with plotting against their
new masters and were, therefore, put to death. Nothing was accomplished
in this expedition, and after twenty months Cortez returned to Mexico.
Soon after he was recalled to Spain to answer various charges due to
his maladministration and to his uncontrolled dictatorship. He was
treated with great honor and named captain-general of New Spain, but
care was taken that he should no longer be intrusted with the duty of
civil administration in the new province. He returned to Mexico in 1530
and again tried his fortune as a discoverer, this time undertaking,
either personally or by lieutenants, expeditions to the northwest. Two
fleets equipped by him were destroyed; a third was led by him into the
unpromising region about the Gulf of California. In 1540, he again
left Mexico to secure an indemnity from Charles V for his unsuccessful
ventures. He followed the Emperor to the siege of Algiers in 1541, but
was not able to secure attention to his demands. The rest of his life
was passed in preparing petitions to a monarch whose treasury was being
drained by other more immediate claims. He did not return to Mexico,
and died on December 2, 1547, at the age of sixty-three years.
III THE INCAS
It is the custom to associate, when the spheres of Spanish conquest
are in question, the Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru. The
parallel is only roughly accurate, for, although the Incas had made
a great record in material advancement by the time they came into
contact with the Spaniards, the level reached by them was considerably
lower than that attained by their neighbors to the north. Their method
of reckoning was far more primitive; they used picture painting for
ornament; there was no commerce, no division of labor, no standard of
value. On the other hand there was no such cannibalism as that found
consecrated to the religious usages of the Nahuatlaca.Among the Incas there was a vast peasant class who had been brought
into subjection by the conquering race who entered Peru from the
south. Apparently the first home of these invaders was the high land
of Bolivia, in a small canton, Cuzco, situated on the natural highway
that leads from the Bolivian highlands to the upper tributaries of the
Amazon. The origins of Inca history can hardly go back further than
three hundred years before the Spanish conquest. When the Spaniards
came, consistent traditions were still preserved of the origin of the
dominant tribe that told how, when Cuzco was first settled by them, it
was already occupied by aboriginal inhabitants whose district was taken
possession of by Manco Ccapac, the founder of the Inca rule. From the
time of the first occupation eleven sovereign chiefs had borne sway
over them for a period which may be justly estimated as three hundred
years.There were no chronological records, but there was curiously unique
evidence in the shape of the mummified bodies of the eleven
chieftains, who were given the same attention as lords and landowners
that they enjoyed when alive. Their estates, herds of llamas, serfs
were still treated as belonging to them; food and drink were daily
placed before them; new clothing was prepared, and they were carried
out for daily exercise in richly ornamented litters.The rise of Inca domination had not been without serious opposition;
there was a powerful coalition formed against them when their
aggression became a menace to the neighboring tribes. The Inca
chieftains were killed, and the situation was saved only by the
appointment of a new leader, Huiracocha, who saw that more was to be
won by conciliation than by aggression. This chieftain was one of the
four to whom the consolidation of the Inca dominions was due. Under
a later Inca chieftain Pachacutic (1435-1471), “the changer of the
world,” the pueblo of Cuzco dominated the whole of central Peru, and a
district 300 miles in length towards the northwest. To the southeast it
had a sphere of influence over a district of about equal extent, which
was converted into definite subjection by Pachacutic and his allies.The next stage of conquest was towards the north, where no special
obstacles were encountered. The population was sparse, and in a low
condition. Here an Inca colony was founded, which, with its capital
at Quito, still survives under the form of the republic of Ecuador.
From this vantage ground in their northern colony the Incas seem to
have been brought into direct connection with the sea coast, for,
owing to the long overland journey between Cuzco and their northern
possessions, the water route was easier, and owing to the penetration
of the land by the gulf of Guayaquil would easily suggest itself to
those who as residents of the interior were not familiar before with
journeyings by water. The advance into the coast valleys met with stout
resistance on the part of a powerful confederacy which had Chimu as
its center. The place was of strategical value to the Incas because it
commanded important roads leading from the coast plain to the sierras,
and was also accessible to the newly acquired northern colony and its
hereditary domains.Because of the successive steps by which the power of the Incas was
so rapidly extended, the name of Pachacutic was associated with the
whole of the administration of the Inca state as a lawgiver, architect,
engineer, economist, and chief priest. His successor Tupac-Yuparqui
followed in his father’s steps by enlarging the state’s borders both
on the south and north. Resistance was cruelly repressed, as one sees
from the narrative of his war on the coast valley of Huarco, where
the Inca’s warriors, brought together for three years in a permanent
camp, wore out the natives by constant harryings, until they agreed to
capitulate on the condition of being incorporated with the Inca nation.
Tupac had no scruples in violating the compact by a general massacre of
the vanquished. Even at the conquest immense heaps of bones were still
pointed out, as relics of the methods by which Inca rule had been built
up.In 1493, Tupac died at Cuzco and was succeeded by his son Huaina
Capac under whom the era of expansion came to an end; he occupied
himself with temple building, with road construction, and with making
punitive expeditions on the savage tribes who dwelt on the outskirts
of his empire. Afterwards, in 1525, he fell a victim to an epidemic.
There was a civil war due to a rebellion in the northern colony under
Tupac-atahuallpa who assumed the government because of the incapacity
of Huascar, the new chieftain at Cuzco. The revolt was successful; the
warriors from the northern colony steadily advanced until they forced
Huascar to leave Cuzco and finally to surrender himself and his family
into the hands of the rival chieftain, after which he was taken to
Lazamara, the fortified station midway between the northern colony and
the original dominion.The extent of the territory conquered by the Incas, as well as the
rapidity with which the conquest was made, gives their annals a unique
position in the history of tribal life at a comparatively low state of
culture. As soon as they passed beyond the confines of middle Peru,
their expansion as a conquering power met with no setback. The peoples
who were threatened by their advance did not form a coalition against
them, and when new areas were once conquered, new peoples were at once
added, who supplied them with additional warriors. The structure of
the empire was so simple, so loosely knit that it collapsed as soon as
it was confronted by the serious internal difficulties that grew out
of the disputed succession. The Spaniards came at an opportune moment
and received without trouble the large landed inheritance of the Inca
overlord, whose domains covered the territory now occupied by Ecuador,
Peru, Bolivia, and Chili.In estimating the standard of civilization attained by the Incas their
theology, which is certainly of an advanced type, is naturally taken
into account. The worship of the sun was one of the strongest bonds
that kept together their widely separated lands. In each pueblo there
was an estate of the sun god that was worked exactly as if it belonged
to a chieftain. This economic network of temple estates was primarily
intended to provide the sun with such constant supplies of food
that the god’s beneficent activity on the earth and to man could be
sustained. The processes of tillage and the craft of weaving were all
brought in this way in close relation to the religion of the dominant
people. Portions of the finest woven stuffs, along with the offerings
of the ground, were burned in sacrifice at each pueblo; the rest was
carried on the backs of llamas belonging to the estates of the sun for
the great festivals celebrated annually at Cuzco, where these beasts
of burden and all they carried were sacrificed in honor of the god. An
essential part of the ritual of sacrifice was the offering of human
victims. These were not war captives as in Mexico; they were taken from
the women serfs, attached to the estates of the sun, the weavers of the
llama wool, who were called “the selected ones.” This name was given
to them because from each family in the pueblo there was collected a
regular tribute of girls, distinguished by their beauty and vigor, who
were trained to become members of the communities dedicated to the
sun’s service. After an education of eight years most of them were
distributed among the various temples of the gods, the sun receiving
the larger share, while some were given to the Ccapac Inca himself or
to his officials.These offerings of human victims took place at the prescribed
sacrifices during the religious year, and also at extraordinary
crises--for example, when the Inca chieftain was attacked by disease,
when the country was endangered by wars, or when earthquakes and
eclipses occurred. To symbolize the sun, images in the figure of a
man were carved with an attire resembling that of the Inca chieftain,
decorated with a headdress of darts, to resemble the solar rays.As in Mexico the warrior class in Peru had a special ritual of sun
worship not shared by outsiders. In this case the idol represented an
infant molded of solid gold, with golden embroidery, shod with golden
sandals, and with a headdress copied from that worn by the chiefs.
For the purpose of popular worship, as these esoteric rites were not
accessible to the common people, great sun dials covered with leaf
of gold were set up, where they were exposed to the rays of the sun,
and on them simple liquid offerings were made, that were visibly
appropriated by the god through the processes of evaporation.A great center of pilgrimage was the throne of the sun at Titicaca
where, in the innermost shrine, there was a sacred rock the summit of
which glittered with gold leaf. In the neighborhood of Cuzco and on
the road to the rock of pilgrimage there were stations of sacrifice,
where burnt-offerings of llamas, cocoa, and maize were made in order
to inaugurate the new sun’s progress from his ancient birthplace in
the south. Sunrise was the time selected for these offerings; a white
llama, bearing fuel, maize, and cocoa leaves, was previously led up
to the mountain top, fire was kindled, and the victim was slain and
consumed in the flames. By the time the sun was about to rise above the
horizon, the burning pile was in full blaze. As the sun rose, the Incas
chanted the prayer for the protection of their god: “O Creator, Sun,
and Thunder, be forever young! Multiply the people, let them ever be in
peace.”In the Peruvian religious system much attention was given to the
service of dead chieftains by a class of special attendants organized
like those who served the gods. There was, therefore, throughout the
whole Inca domains, a large class of ecclesiastics well endowed with
lands and serfs; at Cuzco at the time of the conquest most of the
inhabitants of the pueblo were assigned to the service of some mummy.
There was no hope for the living unless they could keep the good will
of the dead; in all the affairs of life they had a part, food was
set before the dead body at feasts and liquid refreshment was forced
between the mummy’s lips.Huascar, the rival of Atahuallpa for the chieftainship of the Incas,
lost the support of the warrior class because he was reported to have
said that all the dead ought to be buried and their property taken
from them. He did not wish to rule over mummies, from less sentimental
reasons than those once expressed on a celebrated occasion by the
spirit of Achilles. There had undoubtedly originated in Peru a movement
against the economic monopoly connected with the temple worship. An
effort had been made to meet this difficulty on the part of the Inca
chieftains, who apparently, in view of the multiplication of festivals
and sacrifices, had adopted the policy of diminishing the worship of
the minor divinities and of concentrating the sacrificial offerings as
far as they could on the Creator, Sun, Thunder, Earth, and Moon.Under Inca rule the simple tribal administration was retained
throughout the group of districts which were added in rapid succession
to the seat of the race at Cuzco. Each Inca pueblo had its local chief
or curaca, to whom were assigned a certain number of llamas and those
portions of the land that were worked for him by the peasantry, who
did all the agricultural labor. Distributions of the same character
were made in each pueblo for the use of the head chieftain who dwelt
at Cuzco, the so-called Ccapac Inca, and for the service of the tribal
chieftains. The products of these reservations were taken to Cuzco and
deposited there in store-houses from whence the llama hair was given to
the women of the chief pueblo and woven by them into cloth. The food
and the cloth so prepared were either kept as stores for military
expeditions or used for sacrificial purposes.As the territory of the empire was enlarged, this original system was
applied to it. In each central district there was the same arrangement
of buildings secular and religious, the Inca-tampu and the Ccoricancha,
to which the produce of the lands belonging to the overlord and the sun
was brought at regular intervals. These stations are found generally
throughout the Inca domains, except in the coast-valleys. Between them
were minor stations where two messengers were kept to carry orders
from one stage to the other. Where there were natural difficulties to
be overcome, in the long line of communication between the capitals
Quito and Cuzco, a distance of 1500 miles in extent, causeways were
built, and over streams and torrents enduring bridges were stretched,
made of timber laid in strong ropes of twisted grass. There was a
second road along the coast of the same length, but here, where the
country was sandy, nothing was to be found save direction marks to
indicate the correct track to be followed. In Cuzco there are still
standing massive, finely-executed foundation walls which attest the
skill of Inca builders. The temple of the sun can still be traced in
the edifices of the European occupation. On an elevation commanding
the road which led to middle Peru, the coast-valleys, and the northern
colony there stands an impressive mass of cyclopean masonry, the
fortress of Sacsahuaman, which represents the great terraced fortress
begun by the founder of the Inca dominion and apparently not yet
finished at the time of the conquest.Though the Incas preserved a systematic administration that worked
with mechanical accuracy over the area of their empire, it was at best
a despotism, and their chieftains were nothing better than crude and
brutal tyrants. The mental capacity of the race seems to have been
below that of the people of Mexico, and their culture was certainly
lower, as is seen in the absence of artistic advance on their part
along with their inability to invent picture-writing, to work out the
divisions of time, or to elaborate a system of numbers, although
they were acquainted with denary arithmetic, and regularly observed the
solstices. As warriors, they seem to have been drilled efficiently but
mechanically; they were unable to foresee changes or adapt themselves
to them when they came. They were vanquished by the Europeans more
easily than the Aztecs had been, and their downfall was brought about
by the assistance rendered the Spaniards by hosts of native allies.
IV PIZARRO
The discovery of the Pacific Ocean and the foundation of the city of
Panama on the narrow peninsula, led to the undertaking of voyages of
exploration farther south, and this in turn to the entrance into Inca
territory. In one of these enterprises progress was made as far as
the Gulf of Guayaquil. The unanimous report was that the country for
hundreds of miles was in a state of nature, unoccupied, unhealthful,
covered with swamps, forests, and lofty mountains; but the voyagers had
also heard that farther on to the south there was an empire, Bisu by
name, civilized and notorious for its great wealth.[Illustration: FRANCISCO PIZARRO(From the original painting in the palace of the Viceroys at Lima.)]Francis Pizarro had been associated with Balboa up to the time of
that leader’s assassination; afterwards he planned to act on his own
account, and his planning ended in the organization of an expedition
to acquire this empire of the south. The natural son of a Spanish
noble, Pizarro, who was born about 1471 at Truxillo, had had no such
advantages of education as those enjoyed by Cortez; he lacked also that
conqueror’s impetuosity and chivalrous traits. Of the bad sides of the
earlier conquistador he had more than a double portion; he was cold,
calculating, and inflexible, shrinking from no cruelty and without a
trace of the emotionalism which made Cortez so popular among his men.Before giving a concrete shape to his scheme of conquest, he formed a
commercial arrangement with Almagro an adventurer, and Luque a priest
and schoolmaster of Panama, for the purpose of getting a financial
backing. The first essay made in 1524 ended without tangible results.
The coast of Peru was seen, and the adventurers were long enough on
shore at Tumbez to see a surprisingly large number of gold and silver
ornaments. They were not sufficiently strong to carry them off, but
they had seen enough to pay for the hardships of their three years’
trip south and back. Pizarro then betook himself to Spain to get
further support, and before he returned to Panama he had made personal
arrangements with the government with respect to the basis on which he
would carry out his plan of conquest. Some jealousy arose because of
Pizarro’s manifest intention to assume the place of senior partner; the
proposed expedition was saved only by the diplomacy of Luque, who again
drew together his two comrades.Finally, in 1532, Pizarro sailed away from Panama with three ships
carrying in all 120 men and 36 horses. According to the plan accepted,
Almagro was to follow with reinforcements, while Don Luque remained
in Panama to prevent outside interference with the combination. News
had come, as we have mentioned, to the ears of Huaina Ccapac of the
landing of white men at Tumbez in 1525. Between this date and the year
of Pizarro’s second trip had intervened the period of civil war between
the rival claimants, with the captivity of the legitimate son, Huascar,
in the spring of 1532. By April, after a two months’ trip down the
coast, Pizarro arrived off the pueblo of Tumbez. He found it abandoned
and dismantled. Spending some time exploring the neighborhood, he
founded the town of San Miguel, and was put in possession of the facts
that gave him his opportunity for advance into the interior. Huascar,
desiring to get the coöperation of the Spaniards in maintaining his
hold on the country, sent messengers to Pizarro with such encouraging
words that the plan of conquest could already be outlined. Pizarro knew
how, by making use of the divisions of the natives, Cortez had taken
Mexico; his own opportunity had come sooner than he had expected. “If
the land had not been divided,” said Pedro Pizarro, “we should have
been able neither to enter nor conquer it.” On September 24, 1532,
only about 200 Europeans, all told, set out; but the number of natives
in Pizarro’s army was considerable. All the partisans of Huascar in
the neighborhood were expected to join the Spaniards, because before
setting out Pizarro had announced his intention of supporting Huascar,
the “natural lord of the country.”The Spaniards had, however, not made much progress towards the pueblo
of Caxamalca when word came from Atahuallpa, the other claimant,
that he desired the friendship of Pizarro; to reinforce his friendly
sentiments a present accompanied the message. Pizarro spoke, in reply,
of his desire for the Inca chieftain to be his friend and brother, and
explained that his chief purpose in coming was to teach the principles
of the Christian religion. Shortly after this official description of
his mission had been given Pizarro moved forward; no opposition was
offered, although in one place a large river had to be crossed where
resistance would have been easy.In order to obtain information about Atahuallpa efforts were made,
without success, to get some account of his intentions. An Indian chief
was tortured; his information was that the Inca was preparing to make
war, in three places, on the Christians; later on it was reported that
Atahuallpa was near Caxamalca with over 50,000 warriors. Perplexed,
Pizarro employed a native notable to go to Atahuallpa as a friendly
envoy to make clear to him that the Spaniards were coming as allies.
As Pizarro’s men began to fear that they would be exposed to attack on
the last stage of the journey, they were comforted by their commander’s
assurance that they were really nothing more than peaceful missionaries
of God and representatives of their king to ignorant heathen to whom
they wished no harm.The fears of the adventurers were set at rest by discovering from the
natives they passed on their march up the sierras, that Atahuallpa was
not preparing to meet them in anything but a peaceful fashion. In the
difficult region through which they were being led, their advance
could have been checked by a slight display of force. But the friendly
attitude of the Inca chieftain was proved on several occasions by the
appearance of messengers with food; Pizarro promised, on his side, that
he would help to put down any remaining disaffection. On the part of
the inhabitants there was no reason to suspect that the orders given by
their superiors to serve and obey the newcomers were not reasonable.
The general impression among the natives was that the Europeans were
children of their god, the sun. Naturally this belief tended to give
them a sacred character. Up to the present, indeed, there had been
no conflicts with the natives except at Tumbez and at Puna, where
the opposition was confined to a few hundred Indians. On the arrival
in Caxamalca, Pizarro still kept up the ruse of being an ingenuous
tourist; he sent personally to Atahuallpa to beg for an interview,
insisting on his willingness to help him, and promising, if enemies
were pointed out, he would send his men to reduce them.Pizarro had now no difficulty in applying the scheme of conquest so
successfully illustrated by Cortez in Mexico, but common enough to
the conquistadors everywhere. By getting possession of the chief, the
Spaniards made sure of the people; like Montezuma in Mexico, Atahuallpa
in Peru was adored as a god. To put the capture of the Inca into
execution was not difficult. He was invited to be present at a feast
given by Pizarro. Under cover of this hospitable act his person could
be seized. The risk came from the fact that he had about him 30,000
men. The night before the plot was to be carried out the Spanish camp
gave itself up to religious exercises, the captain Pizarro taking the
lead in encouraging his men to face the coming danger. Much comfort
was derived from the assurances of the ecclesiastics who accompanied
the expedition that God was on their side and would aid them to put
his enemies to confusion. Careful arrangements had been made that the
Spanish men-at-arms should be held in readiness in their quarters,
prepared to sally into the square of the town at a moment’s notice. The
artillerymen were bidden to train their guns on the Inca camp, and
fire on it when the command was given. Pizarro took with him twenty
men to aid in the seizure of Atahuallpa. In the great square where the
Spaniards were lodged no one was to leave quarters until the artillery
fire began. Much help was expected from the horsemen in causing a
panic among the Indians, and they were told to put little bells on the
harness.The square of the pueblo that Pizarro selected to carry out his plan
seemed expressly constructed for the deed. Triangular in shape, there
were but two means of egress from it--two doors which gave access to
the streets of the town. When the time appointed came, as the Inca
chief delayed, Pizarro sent word to him to be expeditious, as the meal
was being delayed until he arrived. Atahuallpa, taking an escort of
6000, who were unarmed except for small cudgels and slings, came into
the square. Here there was every appearance of festivity; some of
the men were dancing and singing; some carried plates and crowns of
gold and silver. In a litter, made of gold and silver, Atahuallpa was
borne along through the files of his escort, who parted ranks when he
appeared, all keeping absolute silence. He then listened to a harangue
from a Spanish friar inviting him to obey the Pope and receive the
faith of Christ, and also to become the friend and tributary of the
King of Spain. Otherwise he was threatened with the fate of an enemy;
the Spaniards told him they would abolish all idols, “so that you may
leave the lying religion of your many and false gods.”Atahuallpa, in his answer, objected to taking the proffered position
of tributary, but wished to be a friend of the King of Spain; he also
declined to receive his kingdom at the hands of the Pope, as the friar
had told him the King of Spain had done. On theological points he
showed himself a skilled disputant, contrasting the Christian God, who
had died, with the sun and moon, who had never died. He also inquired
of the friar how he knew that the God of the Christians had created the
world. The pious friar gave him his Breviary, explaining that he had
learnt of the Creator from that book. Atahuallpa looked at it, opened
its pages, first thanked him, then threw it on the ground, saying
it told him nothing of the kind. Indignantly the friar picked up the
Breviary and rushed to Pizarro, crying out, “The Gospels are on the
ground. Vengeance! Christians, at them! they do not wish our friendship
nor our law! Kill these dogs who despise God’s law. Go on, and I
absolve you.”At this instant the guns were fired, the trumpets sounded, and the
infantry and cavalry came forth from their shelters. The sight of the
armed warriors on their horses and the noise of the guns threw the
Indians into a panic. In the rush to get out of the square, part of
the wall surrounding it, was broken down. The Indians fell on top of
one another, closely pursued by the horsemen, who trampled them down
without mercy. Those who held their ground inside the inclosure were
dealt with by the foot soldiers, and most of them were killed. There
was no resistance, for the natives were practically unarmed. Atahuallpa
was, as had been agreed, taken alive, many of his nobles giving up
their lives to protect his person from attack. As the members of his
bodyguard fell, their places were taken with desperate heroism by
others of the group.The massacre was likened by one of the chroniclers to the killing of
sheep. The victims numbered more than 10,000, and only 200 escaped.
Not a Spaniard perished nor even was wounded except Pizarro, who had
a flesh wound in the hand, inflicted accidentally by one of his own
men. Pizarro’s act in hewing down this crowd of Peruvians, unarmed and
panic-stricken, recalls the worst features of the Mexican conquest,
the massacre of Cholula and the attack made by Alvarado on the Mexican
chiefs while they were celebrating a religious festival.The next day was spent in sacking the palace of Atahuallpa, whose rich
stores of gold and silver were discovered. Next came the question of
the disposition of the captives, 8000 or more. It was actually proposed
that the warriors should be killed or have their hands cut off, but
Pizarro, who had not been trained in vain to the economic principles of
conquest, decided that all should be reduced to slavery. The reduction
of Atahuallpa to the status of a prisoner had the desired effect. The
subordinate chiefs made their peace. This was a welcome escape from
further hostilities, but Pizarro was more interested in arranging
terms for the ransom which Atahuallpa was willing to give to receive
his liberty. The gold and silver kept coming in; sometimes in one day
70,000 pesos were received.Pizarro not being satisfied with the industry of the natives in
getting treasure, Spanish emissaries were sent to Cuzco. Under their
experienced hands the supplies increased; in one day 200 loads of gold
and 25 of silver were brought into Caxamalca. Much of the precious
metal was made up of strips taken from the walls of the temples, which
were tapestried in this way. Some ornaments are mentioned; such as a
fountain made entirely of gold and a golden footstool weighing 18,000
pesos. All was melted down except a few objects of small weight, kept
and sent to the King of Spain as curiosities.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'Despite the paying of this enormous ransom, there was no question of
keeping faith with their captive. He was only in the way now that
Pizarro had the enormous ransom. His death would remove a dangerous
rallying point, and by it his people would be thrown into such
confusion that they would submit the more easily to the yoke that was
being prepared for them. Like the chief of the Aztecs, Cuauhtemoc,
Atahuallpa was charged with disloyalty to the Spanish crown, of which
he was assumed to be a dependent. As the zealous representative of his
King, Pizarro passed sentence of death on his prisoner, commanding that
it be executed by burning. All protests from the victim were unheeded,
even when he assured his conquerors that through him they could keep
the Indians on terms of good will. “If,” he said, “they wished gold and
silver, he was ready to hand over twice the amount they had already
received.” As they did not believe he could keep any such engagement,
they refused to defer the day of execution. When the pile was ready,
Atahuallpa, on finding that if he became a Christian, he would not be
burnt, went through the form of conversion. Pizarro ordered that he
should be bound to a stake on the square of the pueblo and strangled.
(August 29, 1533.)One of Atahuallpa’s brothers was then proclaimed chief by the
Spaniards, and with this “roi fainéant” in tow Pizarro set out on
the two months’ march to the capital, Cuzco. Before he came to the
neighborhood of the leading pueblo, Inca warriors disputed with some
obstinacy his further progress; but the presence of their chieftain
with Pizarro prevented anything like a serious rising of the people.
Disgusted with this most untoward event, Pizarro blamed an Inca
general, who had been made a prisoner at Xauxa, for the resistance
made on the march. This was enough to prove his guilt; the prisoner
was condemned to death and burnt alive a short distance from Cuzco.
Even this flagrant outrage failed to move the Incas to any organized
effort to stay the European advance; instead of moving aggressively,
Manco, the brother of Huascar, came voluntarily to Pizarro asking his
protection, hoping by his aid to become the chieftain of the Incas.
This alliance made it easy for the Spaniards, posing as the supporters
of the regular line, to get within the walls of Cuzco without
opposition, on November 15, 1533. The great massive pueblo with the
fortress and temple of the sun, and with its extensive population, was
a rich prize. Everything in the way of gold was quickly removed, and
the humble followers of the modest commercial undertaking so recently
organized at Panama found themselves in the possession of wealth.
But the great drawback was the high price of provisions by which the
adventurers lost some of the treasure that had fallen to their share.
Under such conditions of forced hospitality Pizarro arranged for the
elevation of Manco as Ccapac-Inca or overlord. At the same time Cuzco
received the gift of municipal government, March 24, 1534. Pizarro,
not forgetful of his own services, took the title of governor, and
everything was speedily changed. Cuzco now had a bishop, a cathedral
was built, monasteries and convents arose as if by magic, and all the
famous temples were transformed into churches.Things were moving expeditiously and smoothly in Pizarro’s favor,
until he learnt of the arrival at a place not far from Quito of an
officer of Cortez, Pedro de Alvarado, the governor of Guatemala, with
an expedition of 500 Europeans and more than 2000 Indian allies.
This interference seemed likely to cause trouble, until Alvarado
was persuaded to sell his army and everything in it to Pizarro. The
sum handed over to avoid a competitive conquest, which would have
meant loss of life and, more important still, from the point of view
of these experts in exploitation of subject races, loss of time,
was considerable. Alvarado withdrew with something like $2,000,000;
gauged by the standards of butchery, rapacity, and knavery in the West
Indies and in Mexico, this was a splendid bargain. But, as Alvarado
had only set his foot on Peruvian soil, he had not yet begun to
reckon imperially; he was certainly far removed still from Pizarro’s
poetic fancy in finance. Now that there was no longer a chance for
such awkward interruptions, Pizarro set about the foundation of a new
capital for Peru. Cuzco, being far distant from the seacoast, was
manifestly unsuitable, and accordingly Lima was founded on the 6th
of January, 1535, to be the center of this new colonial possession.
Preparations were already under way for a regular administration with
Pizarro at the head, after the model of the rule established by Cortez
in Mexico.The royal fifth of the treasure taken was so large that it removed all
obstacles at Madrid. Detailed confirmation was given to the general
concessions made to Pizarro, and their territorial extent was amplified
by adding seventy leagues of land to the south. Almagro received a
concession extending from the southern limit of Pizarro’s province 200
leagues. To the northern territory was given the name New Castile, to
the southern, New Toledo; but the Indian names, Peru and Chili, were
too strongly imbedded in native usage to be forced out of existence.When Almagro was sent by Pizarro to Cuzco with orders to use it as a
starting-point for the southern territory that had been assigned to
him, the lieutenant took the opportunity of claiming that the Inca
capital was situated south of Pizarro’s concession, and, therefore,
was a part of his own land. This difficulty being patched up on June
12, 1535, Almagro set out for the conquest of Chili, while Pizarro
began the establishment of a new seacoast town, Trujillo, and pushed
forward the building of Lima.The native population was dealt with after the “repartimiento” plan.
Under the burden of their new oppressors, the Indians, who had for
so long submitted to the cruder tyranny of the Inca chiefs, rose in
revolt. Manco, a scion of the old house, placed himself at the head of
the anti-Spanish movement, and the first success of the natives was
the capture of the citadel of Cuzco, February, 1536. In the meantime
the Spaniards who lived in isolated plantations had been massacred.
Both the new towns, Lima and Trujillo, were invested. After a time
the citadel of Cuzco was retaken from the natives, but Juan, one
of Pizarro’s brothers, met his death in the fighting. As a relief
expedition Pizarro sent to Cuzco more than 400 men, of whom 200 were
cavalry, but they never succeeded in crossing the Sierra. Aid was then
asked from the neighboring colonies of Panama, Guatemala, and Mexico.
With the help of abundant reinforcements, Cuzco was retaken, and the
obstinacy of the Spaniards in holding their ground for six months
discouraged the Indians from further efforts to cut off the old capital.When Almagro discovered the unattractive character of his newly
assigned province, where the population was hostile and the land
largely a desert, he returned along the western declivities of the
Andes to reassert his claims on Cuzco. Arriving there in April, 1537,
he made a successful night attack on the place, and took Pizarro’s
brother, Fernando, prisoner. Near Cuzco Alvarado was stationed with 500
men at Xanca, and here a battle took place on July 12, 1537, in which
Alvarado was beaten and taken prisoner. Almagro then set out for Lima.
He and Pizarro, after a meeting at Mala on November 13, 1537, agreed to
submit the question of the limits of their provinces to arbitration,
arranging in the meantime that Almagro should hold Cuzco and Ferdinand
Pizarro should have Caxamalca. But this arrangement was not carried
out. Ferdinand soon after organized an expedition to recapture Cuzco,
and another battle was fought with Almagro in April, which resulted
in the latter being taken prisoner. After being given the semblance
of a trial, he was put to death on July 8, 1538, by Fernando. Francis
Pizarro, who denied complicity in Almagro’s death, treated the latter’s
son kindly, but he did not forget to reward his own brothers, after he
had made his triumphal entrance into Cuzco, with large landed estates.
To Gonzalo he gave the district of Lake Titicaca, which included the
mines of Potosi.The assassination of Almagro stirred up indignation among his friends,
who determined, that when the official explanations were presented in
Spain by Pizarro’s emissaries, their side should be given a hearing.
In the mother country, the authorities refused to distinguish between
the claims of the two factions. What was plain was that dissensions
in the colony could only damage Spanish control, and might lead to a
restoration of Indian rule there. Accordingly a royal commissioner was
sent out with ample powers.Before the new official arrived, Pizarro showed his characteristic
industry in expanding the sphere of Spanish influence. Groups of
adventurers were sent out in different directions, and plans were made
which ended in the foundation of Santiago in Chili. One of Pizarro’s
brothers was sent off with an army of 340 Europeans and 4000 Indians
to conquer the country east of the Andes. Led by the usual stories
of the existence of gold and precious stones in far-distant regions,
the Spaniards in this expedition, overcoming the most extraordinary
natural difficulties in their march, succeeded in reaching one of the
tributaries of the Amazon. A boat was then built by means of which
one of the members of the party, Orellana, with a few companions,
made the long trip to the ocean, and finally succeeded in reaching
a Spanish colony on one of the islands of the Antilles. This was a
unique achievement, for the vessel in which he sailed was constructed
of green timber, there was no compass, no pilot was to be had, and
provisions had to be collected from the natives along the bank of the
river, who sometimes received the strangers with no friendly welcome.
Orellana, in relating his achievements, demonstrated the creative power
of his imagination as well as his heroism. He told of seeing nations
so rich that the roofs of their temples were covered with plates of
gold, and also related how he had passed through a republic controlled
by women, who by the force of their arms had acquired the rule over
a considerable tract of country. From these fictions of Orellana
originated the belief in the existence of a region called El Dorado,
and the conviction that somewhere in the center of South America there
existed a community of Amazons.In 1545 the silver mines of Potosi were discovered, an event which
played an enormous rôle in the colonization of the country, because
its wealth realized the most sanguine hopes of the adventurers.
Upper Peru--or as it is now called, Bolivia--became the greatest
silver mining country in the known world. Meanwhile the success of
Pizarro’s administration stirred up among Almagro’s friends increasing
bitterness, for they saw no chance of receiving a share of the good
fortune which was being showered upon the governor, his brothers, and
his favorites. Almagro’s son, who was in Lima, made that town the
central point of the faction that was bent on Pizarro’s ruin. The
governor, though aware of the existence of these intrigues, affected
to treat them with disdain. He relied on the possession of absolute
power as the complete protection against any plot. This foolhardy
attitude was taken advantage of by the conspirators, who, without much
difficulty, penetrated into his house and put him to death June 26,
1541. Even Pizarro’s own followers, the men who had shared with him the
dangers of the conquest and the spoils of victory, raised no hand to
avenge his murder. His Borgia-like character had alienated all, except
his immediate relatives whom, as has been said, he had elevated to high
positions.When the governor from Spain, Vaca de Castro, reached the country,
he proceeded to inflict strict justice on the conspirators. After an
armed conflict near Cuzco, between the partisans of Almagro and the
upholders of the authority of the home government, most of those
who were guilty of the murder of Pizarro fell into the governor’s
hands, who promptly executed them as rebels (1542). But the country
was not destined to enjoy tranquillity long. Gonzalo Pizarro, the
brother of the “conquistador,” acquired by force the possession of the
colony, and succeeded in extending his rule over Peru and its various
dependencies. He even sent north a fleet which captured Panama and
so got command of the western ocean. But the usurper’s rule did not
last long, for, when he was disowned by the home government, he found
himself unable to maintain his authority over the colonists. Like his
more famous brother, Gonzalo died the death of a malefactor, and the
vast possessions acquired on the west coast of South America by the
adventurers of the earlier period of Spanish conquest came under the
systematic and regular control of the Spanish bureaucratic machinery.By the middle of the sixteenth century the spectacular features of
the conquest of Spanish America vanished away. Large and unexplored
territories were indeed added to the monarchy of Spain, but as the
lands so annexed were populated by Indian tribes in no higher state
of culture than those found in the lesser Antilles, the methods of
conquest were but a repetition of those employed by the adventurers
of an earlier period. On the whole it may be said that the treatment
of the natives improved, especially in those districts where there
was no mining or where gold could be discovered near the surface.
Long after the complete administrative organization of the conquered
lands in Mexico, of Central America, of the northern portions of South
America, and of the Pacific slope of that continent, the colonies
on the Atlantic side, even if they were founded earlier, were less
attractive to the colonist. The Jesuits first appeared in Paraguay in
1586, though Uruguay was opened up for settlement some time before.
The town of Buenos Ayres was established in 1538 amid surroundings
which gave little hope to colonial settlement. The original group of
3000 Europeans who entered the new Province of La Plata were almost
exterminated by disease and by the fatiguing and incessant warfare
with the savage races about them.From the point of view of the old mercantile system of political
economy, Spain’s colonial policy was advantageous to the home
government. It is usual to expose the failure of the government of
Madrid to manage its vast empire under any other ideals than those
of absolutism, but when one considers the size and novelty of the
experiment that Spain was making in these Western lands, and when one
estimates broadly the stage of civilization so soon reached in a large
number of new communities, it must be allowed that to the government
of the peninsula is to be ascribed the credit of accomplishing a task
practically unparalleled in modern history. The work was not thoroughly
done; there were grave and deplorable defects. Yet without accepting at
all the truth of the dictum that whatever is, is right, it can be said
that no colonial possessions of other powers during the same century
offered the same problems as those confronted by Spain, and nowhere in
North America was the progress of extensive occupation and intensive
civilization so definitely marked.The Spanish colonial empire has had the misfortune of being exposed to
much the same sort of depreciation as the Byzantine Empire; in both
cases investigation has diminished the weight of conventional hostile
criticism. Doctrinaire theories of government, and unfounded social
contrasts, are apt to produce false standards. It is easy to detect
faults in Spain’s management of her colonies, but it is not easy to
reconstruct for her a policy that might have produced on Spanish
soil the sturdy independence of the New England town meeting, or the
collective wisdom of the founders of the American Constitution.  *  *  *  *  *NAPOLEON
I EARLY YEARS
Corsica, during a large part of the eighteenth century, had drawn upon
itself the attention of Europe, on account of its heroic struggle
for independence. Its champion was Pasquale Paoli, whose character
and patriotism provoked the same sort of enthusiastic attention from
his contemporaries that centered upon Garibaldi 100 years later. The
cause of the islanders against the city of Genoa, which exercised the
right of overlordship over them, was so successfully defended that
had not the kingdom of France interfered as the ally of Genoa, the
establishment of an independent Corsican republic would have been
assured. But unfortunately the Genoese surrendered the sovereignty of
the island to France. The French occupied the harbors, the Corsicans
were defeated in a pitched battle, and Paoli retired as a fugitive
to England. All further resistance was abandoned, and the island was
annexed to France.[Illustration: NAPOLEON I.(From the portrait by P. Delaroche.)]In the Corsican deputation sent to Paris to arrange terms with the
conquerors was Carlo Bonaparte, a member of a noble Tuscan family,
whose ancestors had established themselves in Ajaccio 200 years before.
Some time before this visit to Paris his wife, Maria Letitia, had given
birth to a son, Napoleon. There has recently been a question raised
whether the traditionally accepted date, August 15, 1769, is correct,
and some French investigators are in favor of antedating it by one
year. There were eight surviving children, five of them boys, out of
a family of thirteen. Napoleon describes himself as an unruly child
despite the iron discipline exercised in the home by his mother. “I
was,” he says, “self-willed and obstinate, nothing awed me; nothing
disconcerted me. I was quarrelsome, exasperating; I feared no one, I
gave a blow here and a scratch there. Everyone was afraid of me. My
brother Joseph was the one with whom I had most to do. He was beaten
about and scolded; I complained that he did not get over it soon
enough.”The father, a lawyer by profession, was engaged in unending litigation
in his own behalf, which required frequent trips to Paris, where he was
well known on account of his efforts to recover an estate, deeded by
some relative to the Jesuit order, and also as a representative deputy
of the Corsican nobility. On one of these trips the head of the house
died in 1785; seven years before that date he had been successful in
getting a scholarship for Napoleon at the military school of Brienne,
where the young soldier had just completed his course and received his
commission as lieutenant at the time of his father’s death. At school
Napoleon had made little reputation as a scholar; he stated himself
later on that it was the general opinion that he “was fit for nothing
except geometry.” He was unsociable, with an imperious temperament
that parted everyone from him. One of his schoolfellows writes of his
characteristics as follows: “Gloomy and even savage, almost always
self-absorbed, one would have supposed that he had just come from
some forest, and unmindful, until then, of the notice of his fellows,
experienced for the first time the sensations of surprise and distrust;
he detested games and all manner of boyish amusements. One part of the
garden was allotted to him and there he studied and brooded, and woe to
him who ventured to disturb him. One evening the boys were setting off
fireworks and a small powder-chest exploded. In their fright the troop
scattered in all directions, and some of them took refuge in Napoleon’s
domain, whereat he rushed upon the fugitives in a passion and attacked
them with a spade.”He had wished to enter the navy after his studies were finished,
but there was some delay until, as his family were in straitened
circumstances, he decided to enter the artillery, where the
applications for admission were fewer. So he passed from Brienne to
Paris, where he again seems to have made no very favorable impression,
except on the mathematical instructor at the military school, Monge,
whose report on Bonaparte at the time he was leaving school reads as
follows: “Reserved and studious, he prefers study to amusement of any
kind, and takes pleasure in reading the works of good authors; while
diligent in his study of abstract science, he cares little for any
other; he has a thorough knowledge of mathematics and geography. He is
taciturn, preferring solitude, capricious, haughty, and inordinately
self-centered. While a man of few words, he is vigorous in his replies,
ready and incisive in retort; he has great self-esteem, is ambitious
with aspirations that stop at nothing. He is a young man worthy of
patronage.”The new officer, who was assigned to duty at Valence, found garrison
life very tedious; promotion was slow, there were no drills, camp
life, nor manœuvers; he spent, he says, a good deal of his time
reading novels, planned even to write one, and took some part in the
local life of the town, making friends among the society of petty
officials, lawyers, and other persons of middle-class station. He did
some solid reading also, making himself acquainted with Rousseau, Adam
Smith, and Raynal, the last having so much influence over him, that he
acknowledged himself as Raynal’s disciple in his views as to the need
of social reform in France, which, among other things, implied the
abolition of class privileges and the purification of administration.
His literary attempts were various; he was prompted to make them
because his pay of 100 livres a month, though adequate for himself, was
not sufficient to help out his relatives in Corsica, where his mother
and the rest of the family were in a position of financial difficulty.During the early years of the revolutionary movement in France,
Napoleon spent a large part of the time in Corsica, where the
nationalist party hoped to take advantage of the civil disturbances of
their new rulers, and reclaim their independence. For a time he made
their cause his own, and developed a scheme for driving the French
from the island. But conditions soon changed after Paoli returned
to Corsica. Napoleon, who hoped for high military command among his
own people, failed to secure the support of the old leader, who
suspected the young officer, on account of the radical sympathies he
manifested for the revolutionary party in France. Paoli believed in
a constitutional monarchy, and refused to side with the Convention
which had put Louis XVI to death. Most of the Corsicans followed their
conservative statesman, and in May, 1793, Napoleon and the whole
Bonaparte family were declared outlaws.After an unsuccessful attempt to take Ajaccio from the Paolists
Napoleon, with the rest of his family, abandoned the island and
withdrew to Toulon. His scheme of self-advancement at home had failed;
he had now only France to look to as the field of his ambition. It was
fortunate for him that during this period his irregular connection
with the French army, in which he still held the rank of officer, was
tolerated. He had made himself marked by his openly declared sympathies
with the anti-monarchical party, and for this reason, his independent
action in visiting Corsica and remaining there as long as he liked was
passed over without criticism from his superiors in Paris; indeed,
his captain’s commission was dated February 6, 1792, a time when he
was devoting his attention altogether to Corsican affairs, in his own
interest.His arrival in France coincided with the establishment of the Reign of
Terror, and the government at Paris had on their hands an insurrection
in the southern part of the country which sided with the Girondins,
many of whose leaders had been put to death by the Jacobins. Napoleon
resumed his military service at Nice, and immediately took part in
repressing the Girondin insurrection. He also expressed his full
agreement with the Jacobins in a dialogue entitled the _Souper de
Beaucaire_, a pamphlet intended to win adherents to the cause of the
Terrorists at Paris. His apology called public attention to him,--the
dialogue was printed at the expense of the state, and its author
was soon on friendly terms with the younger Robespierre, one of the
commissioners of the Convention in southern France.In various towns, Marseilles included, the insurrectionists were
losing their foothold. The last important place left to them was
Toulon, where they were being actively supported by English and
Spanish allies. It was necessary to win the place, for preparations
were being made on a large scale by both England and Austria to use
Toulon as a starting-point to invade southern France. Napoleon was
given the command of a battalion of artillery, and it was his scheme
for arranging the batteries around the town that led to the taking of
the city by the French. His services were recognized by promotion to a
brigadier generalship, a fitting reward, for it was his strategy which
had compelled the allied troops of Spain and England to evacuate the
one place on French territory which they occupied.The younger Robespierre spoke of him in a report to the Committee
of Public Safety as a man of transcendent merit. Bonaparte was
intimate with the commissioner, and that he impressed those who knew
him as an ardent sympathizer with the Terrorists is borne out by a
statement contained in Mlle. Robespierre’s memoranda: “Bonaparte was
a republican, I should say that he was a republican of the Mountain,
at least he made that impression upon me from his manner of regarding
things at the time I was in Nice [1794]. Later his victories turned
his head and made him aspire to rule over his fellow-citizens, but,
while he was but a general of artillery in the army of Italy, he was
a believer in thorough-going liberty and equality.” Yet the fanatical
side of the Robespierre government, with its policy of ruthless
massacre, evidently did not win his sympathy, for there is good
ground for believing that, after the capture of Toulon, he was one
of those who counseled moderation towards the vanquished and opposed
the wholesale execution of the rebels. What attracted him to the
Robespierre régime was its directness and its energy, and there is
no doubt that he had a much higher opinion of the personal capacity
of Robespierre than is held by a later school of historians of the
French Revolution, who see in him a somewhat commonplace and decorative
tool of the obscurer members of the Committee of Public Safety. In a
conversation with Marmont, after Robespierre’s downfall, he said, “If
Robespierre had remained in power, he would have been able to strike
out another way for himself, he would have systematized the laws and
made them permanent; we should have attained this result without shocks
and convulsions because it would have proceeded from the exercise of
power. We are now trying to reach this goal through a revolution, and
this revolution will give birth to a monarchy.”As a friend and counselor of Robespierre’s younger brother, who had
already become interested in Napoleon’s scheme for an invasion of
Italy, the prospects of his securing an independent military command
were most encouraging, especially as he had just been so flatteringly
recommended by the younger Robespierre to the Committee of Public
Safety. But all chances of such advancement were lost with the downfall
and execution of the revolutionary dictator in July, 1794.Napoleon was involved in the general ruin of the Robespierre party;
he lost his commission as general and spent a month as a prisoner in
a military fortress. He fortunately had friends who interceded for
him, among them Salicetti, the Corsican, a member of the Convention,
by whose efforts the charge of disloyalty to the Republic was shown to
be baseless and the prisoner was released, reinstated, and given the
important mission of restoring French sovereignty in Corsica, which had
lately declared itself a constitutional monarchy under the protection
of England. The expedition failed on account of the weakness of the
French fleet. For some time after this misadventure Napoleon remained
without a command; the government at Paris was not inclined to forward
the interests of a former partisan of Robespierre.There were besides a number of young officers quite capable of filling
important army commands, and all that Napoleon could secure was an
assignment in the west under Hoche, who was engaged in repressing the
insurrection in La Vendée. He had no taste for such work, nor did he
desire to serve in a subordinate capacity. Taking advantage of the
weakness of the administration, he delayed his departure from Paris,
although he had received peremptory orders to leave for his command.
He hoped by the influence of friends such as Barras, whom he had known
at Toulon, and who was now a man of weight in the counsels of the
party predominant in the Convention, to secure the acceptance from the
ministry of war of his plan for the invasion of Italy. He was not only
disappointed in this hope, but he found himself again stricken from the
list of French generals because of his refusal to proceed to the post
already assigned him.There was no encouragement to be got out of the prevailing political
tendencies, which were showing a marked antagonism to the radical
revolutionary party, with whose program Napoleon had been allied from
the first. A restoration of the monarchy seemed not improbable, for the
common people of Paris were showing signs of restlessness under the
régime of the Terrorist factions. The members of the Convention, after
providing for a stable government with an executive power vested in
a Directory of five members, were fearful of the consequences of the
proposed changes they had themselves provided, and they proceeded to
pass a measure by which the newly elected legislative body, the Council
of Five Hundred, should be composed, to the extent of two-thirds of
its membership, of those who had served in the Convention. This action
caused an open revolt. Forty-four out of the forty-eight sections,
into which Paris was divided, were in arms against the continuance of
the tyranny of the Convention. On one side stood the National Guard
of the city; on the other there were only 8000 regular troops willing
to obey the mandate of the government. Barras happened to be one of
the commissioners of the Convention appointed to preserve order. He
was then chosen commander-in-chief of the army, and, acting with the
reluctant consent of the other members of the Committee, he selected
his friend Napoleon as second in command, with full power to act in
defense of the Convention.No time could be lost, and everything depended on getting artillery
into the city to the Tuileries. Here the guns were stationed, before
the National Guard commenced to advance on the 5th of October. No
one knows who fired the first shot, but the engagement that followed
soon ended in a complete disaster for the insurgents, who were driven
from position to position by the volleys of grapeshot which swept the
streets in the vicinity of the Seine. In recognition of his services
rendered at such a crisis, Napoleon was almost immediately advanced to
the post of commander-in-chief of the Army of the Interior, the way
being made easy for him by Barras’ appointment as one of the Directors
in the new government. Napoleon’s analysis of the situation, made the
day after this fight in the streets of Paris, was characteristically
clear-headed. “Fortune is on my side,” he writes to his brother Joseph,
and from this sudden change in his prospects may be dated that belief
in his star signalized by his favorite motto, “Au destin,” which became
the axiom of his career, as well as its explanation and justification.Barras’ services did not end here; he realized the young general’s
capacity, seeing in him a man whom it would be useful to have bound to
him by personal obligations, and he suggested, and it is said, even
arranged Napoleon’s marriage with Mme. de Beauharnais, a well known
member of Parisian society, the widow of a nobleman who had fallen
a victim of the Terror, and herself a native of Martinique. She had
fascinated the soldier by her charm of manner and was now prepared,
despite the objections of her friends, to give him the social position
that Barras insisted was necessary for his further promotion. This
advice of Barras was not necessarily disinterested, for there were,
it seems, reasons of a different nature, which may have prompted him
to relieve himself, by making use of Napoleon, of further personal
responsibilities he had incurred towards the lady in question. The
marriage had an immediate influence in advancing the fortunes of the
bridegroom, for two days before it was solemnized (March 4, 1796),
Napoleon attained the long-coveted position of commander-in-chief of
the Army of Italy; and on the 11th of the same month, he set out for
his new post.
II ITALY AND EGYPT
Of the great Continental Powers which had formed a coalition against
the revolutionary government of France, Austria and Russia were
actively inimical, and there was no prospect of coming to terms with
them, unless all the conquered territories recently acquired by France
were sacrificed. The idea of natural boundaries had become by this time
a dogma of political faith, and even the Directory, confronted as it
was by a demoralized administration, by bad business conditions, and
by an inflated currency, had no thought of making peace. Armies were
operating along the eastern frontiers; and as soon as Napoleon reached
Nice, he prepared, along the lines he had so frequently urged, to take
the offensive against the vulnerable Austrian provinces of northern
Italy.The force he took over now numbered 38,000 men, out of a nominal
six divisions of 60,282. They were poorly equipped, insufficiently
nourished, and had not received their pay. The manifesto issued to
them, according to Napoleon’s report of it at St. Helena, held out
an immediate change of fortune. It is a document characteristic in
contents and form of the new era of glory and conquest on which France
was now to embark under Napoleon’s leadership. “Soldiers,” he said,
“you are ill-fed and almost naked; the government owes you much; it
can give you nothing. Your patience, the courage which you exhibit
in the midst of these mountains, are worthy of admiration; but they
bring you no atom of glory; not a ray is reflected upon you. I will
conduct you into the most fertile places of the world. Rich provinces,
great cities, will be in your power; there you will find honor, glory,
and wealth. Soldiers of Italy, will you be lacking in courage or
perseverance?”');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'These promises were made good in the remarkable campaign that followed,
in which Napoleon’s soldiers found their material wants amply satisfied
and their ambitious wishes for a career of glory more than answered
in the brilliant victories of their general. Napoleon’s plan of
operations was guided by the principles he had outlined two years
before to the Robespierre régime. “In the management of war, as in the
siege of a city,” he said, “the method should be to direct the fire
upon a single point. The breach once made, equilibrium is destroyed,
all further effort is useless, and the place is taken. Attacks should
not be scattered, but united. An army should be divided for the sake
of subsistence and concentrated for combat. Unity of command is
indispensable to success. Time is everything.”The last mentioned condition was fully vindicated, for before the end
of April the French had beaten in a succession of quickly delivered
attacks and effective battles, the Austrian army occupying Piedmont and
also their Piedmontese allies. With the retreat of the Austrians from
his kingdom, King Victor Amadeus made peace, and Napoleon hurried on
to deal finally with the Austrians on their own territory in Lombardy.
With the winning of the battle of Lodi on the 10th of May, Lombardy was
soon evacuated by the enemy, and Napoleon entered the capital of the
province, Milan, on the 16th of May. The commander of the victorious
army paid little attention to the policy outlined at Paris for his
conduct in Italy; he negotiated independently of the Directory and
oftentimes contrary to their expressed wishes. When they proposed to
divide his command by sharing it with General Kellermann, he wrote,
“Each person has his own way of making war. General Kellermann has had
more experience and will do it better than I; but both together will
do it badly.” By this plain statement, the Directors were brought to
terms; they were unwilling to let Napoleon resign his command, for the
campaign was giving the government the prestige it badly needed, and
what was equally valuable in their eyes was Napoleon’s novel method of
conducting warfare without making any demands on the central treasury.In the meantime there were further successes to be recorded against
the Austrians. Wherever they made a stand they were defeated; a large
number of their men were blocked up in the great citadel at Mantua,
and, for months, armies in succession were sent down from the Tyrol to
relieve that city. The ability of Napoleon was tested in many hard-won
fights against superior numbers; he was often in critical situations,
especially at the battle of Arcola where, for three days (November
17-20, 1796), the stubbornness of the Austrians held the French in
check. During one of the critical incidents of the fight, Napoleon had
personally to rally his men, and, when they were thrown into confusion
by the Austrian fire, he was in danger of capture and was saved only by
the presence of mind of his aide, Marmont, and of his own brother Louis.Further attempts on the part of Austria to preserve its Italian
possessions proved unavailing. After a decisive engagement fought
at Rivoli early in the year 1797, the Austrian garrison at Mantua
capitulated, and with the fall of this fortress, Austrian rule in Italy
was brought to an end. Later on Napoleon followed up these successes by
moving towards Vienna with a force of 34,000 men. He was ably seconded
by his subordinate generals, among whom was Moreau, with the result
that the remaining Austrian forces, gathered to defend their capital,
were defeated, and by the preliminaries of peace signed at Leoben,
Austria lost her Italian possessions, was deprived of her predominant
influence in the peninsula, and agreed to the cession of Belgium. As
a compensation she was to receive the possessions of Venice on the
mainland, on both sides of the Adriatic.These manipulations of territory, so far as Italy was concerned, were
directed entirely in accordance with the personal will of Napoleon,
who had already acted on his own initiative in his dealings with the
petty Italian states. During the course of the campaign he had forced
Tuscany and Naples to accept French sovereignty in the peninsula
practically on his own terms, he had deprived the Pope of a large
part of his territory and, after the terms of the treaty were signed,
but before they were publicly announced, he had sought a quarrel with
Venice, in order to put an end to the republic and so to find an excuse
for annexing part of her territory to France. In this way he could hand
over to Austria the fragments that had been secretly assigned to that
power at Leoben. The brilliancy of these military operations, by which
the whole face of the traditional situation in Italy was altered in the
short space of one year, set Napoleon in such a secure position that
his critics and detractors hesitated to call in question his autocratic
acts, though Mallet du Pan tells us that the praise showered by the
Directory on the young conqueror was recognized as insincere, adding,
“There were voices in favor of sending the young hero to the Place de
la Révolution to have a score of bullets lodged in his pate.”Napoleon himself, contrasting his success with the inefficiency of
the Austrians, describes his victories in the following passage: “My
military successes have been great; but then consider the servants of
the Emperor! His soldiers are good and brave, though heavy and inactive
compared with mine; but what generals! a Beaulieu, who had not the
slightest knowledge of localities in Italy; Wormser, deaf and eternally
slow; or Alvinzy, who was altogether incompetent. They have been
accused of being bribed by me; these are nothing but falsehoods, for I
never had such a thing in view. But I can prove that no one of these
three generals had a single staff on which several of the superior
officers were not devoted to me and in my pay. Hence I was apprised not
only of their plans but of their designs, and I interfered with them,
while they were still under deliberation.”With the states wrested from the Pope, there were taken from the Duke
of Modena and from Austria territories sufficient to found a republic
entitled the Cisalpine, and with this, there was a new rearrangement
of the territories on the west coast by which the ancient republic of
Genoa ceased to exist and reappeared with the Napoleonic brand as
the Ligurian Republic. Both of these creations were after the French
model, but the general of the army drew up the constitutions, chose the
officials, and exercised the irresponsible powers of a dictator. The
final terms of the treaty with Austria were not settled till October,
1797, but nothing was gained by the shrewd diplomatic fencings of the
Viennese representatives. Napoleon, in a theatrical scene, at which he
passionately broke in pieces a valuable porcelain vase in the presence
of Coblentzl, the Austrian envoy, threatened to smash the Austrian
monarchy if the parleyings were too long continued. The liberation of
Italy appealed to the patriotic sentiment of the Italians, until the
political realism of their conqueror manifested itself by enforcing on
them contributions of money, art treasures, valuable manuscripts, all
of which were sifted and collected by the experts Napoleon carried with
his army. Even mathematical instruments and natural history collections
did not escape his vigilance.In the imposition of these exactions, the Papacy fared no better
than the secular princes. While the dukes of Parma and Modena paid
12,000,000 francs and 20 pictures, the Pope was mulcted to the extent
of 21,000,000 francs, 15,000,000 in cash, the rest to be made up by the
surrender of 100 pictures, 500 manuscripts, and the bust of the patriot
Brutus. This original method of making war pay for itself pleased
the Directory. Great fêtes were prepared for the conqueror, when he
appeared in Paris, to celebrate his victories. The official orator of
the occasion was Talleyrand, who selected as the chief points of his
eulogy Napoleon’s modesty, his taste for the poems of Ossian, and his
fondness for mathematics.But to the clear intelligence of Napoleon, forms of adulation, real
or insincere, meant little. He was making rapid progress towards the
goal of personal rule. The government already suspected his loyalty to
them, but they were weak and without moral influence. Besides, they
were under obligations, even more binding than those based or the money
contributions which flowed in from Italy, for when the reactionary
party was about to get the upper hand, both among the Legislative Body
and among the Directors themselves, it was Napoleon’s agent, Augereau,
who had coöperated actively with the radical element and made its
continued predominance in the control of national affairs possible.There was no intention to diminish the weight of the military element
as the predominant partner. By the premature death of Hoche, Napoleon
was left without a rival, and he did not hesitate to speak of the
Directory as a makeshift government. The immediate question was to
prevent an outbreak between the victorious general and his superiors,
by which a return to the monarchy might be made easy. France was
still at war with Great Britain; therefore, when Napoleon proposed to
attack the vulnerable point of British influence in Egypt, with the
ultimate purpose of advancing from there on the British domains in
India, the plan was eagerly accepted by the Directors, despite the
obviously utopian character of the proposal. Napoleon spoke in his best
sententious style of the East as the only place where real glory could
be acquired. The Directors were willing that he should absent himself
from France, glad to purchase freedom from his control by assigning him
a new important command over the best troops in France.It is not probable that Napoleon was at all in earnest in planning
an expedition to India; he appreciated the weakness of the home
government, and from Egypt it would not be difficult to return,
whenever he was needed, in the rôle of the sole savior of the country.
The scale of preparation for this unique military adventure was most
imposing; there was an air of mystery about it; people talked of its
destination being Constantinople or India. Ships, to the number of
500, were gathered at Toulon, manned by 10,000 sailors and fitted to
transport 35,000 veteran troops, taken mostly from the army of Italy.
All of Napoleon’s best generals were to be with him, Berthier, Murat,
Lannes, Davout, Marmont, Duroc, and the two popular commanders from
the army of the Rhine, Kléber and Desaix. Great care was given to the
material and scientific side of the expedition. Scholars and scientific
experts were to accompany it, either for the purpose of antiquarian
research in Egypt, or to develop the unused powers of the soil of the
fertile Nile valley. There was plenty of money, for Berthier was sent
to Rome to exact additional contributions from churches and convents.
He called himself the treasurer of the Egyptian expedition and promised
to fill his treasure chests.The great fleet set sail on the 19th of May, 1798; only when the ships
were at sea did the troops know what was to be their destination.
The first point reached was Malta, where the famous Knights, so long
the residuary legatees of the great crusading tradition, surrendered
without resistance and received a French garrison. By good fortune the
French armada escaped the vigilance of the English fleet which was
cruising in the Mediterranean; and the army was landed at Alexandria on
June 30th.At this time Turkey had only the nominal sovereignty in Egypt, the
real power being in the hands of a military caste, the Mamelouks, who
exercised an oppressive rule over the cultivators of the soil, and
the Arab chieftains, who represented the ancient conquerors of the
country. Napoleon proclaimed himself as a liberator, promising to
respect the customs and religion of the land, and offering his help in
the development of its natural resources. After the easy capture of
Alexandria there was a long, weary march across the desert to Cairo,
during which the troops so suffered from intense heat, fatigue, and
lack of food that there was discontent among both officers and men.The final stand of the Mamelouks was made near Cairo within sight of
the Pyramids, where they tried to rush the French squares with their
cavalry. But the French artillery with its murderous fire decimated the
advancing squadrons before they could come in contact with the French
troops, with the result that on the French side the loss was only about
thirty men, while the Mamelouks reckoned theirs by the thousand. Many
of them, too, were drowned in the Nile. The French soldiers bent their
bayonets and fished the bodies out in order to get the gold pieces in
the belts of the dead warriors. Napoleon grimly reported that “the army
was becoming reconciled to Egypt.” In the midst of these brilliant
achievements, the victory of Nelson at Aboukir on the 1st of August
came like a bolt from the blue, for the French admiral’s fleet was
virtually annihilated, and by this disaster the French army was cut off
from its base and, as it were, imprisoned in the land it had conquered.
Yet Nelson could not follow up his victory; he had no frigates and,
therefore, could not enter the harbor of Alexandria to destroy the
provisions and the transport ships which were collected there.One of the results of the naval battle was an uprising at Cairo, which
was ruthlessly repressed, 5000 of the insurgents losing their lives.
After an expedition had been sent into upper Egypt as far as the
cataracts of Syene, the country was reduced to some kind of order, but
there were further difficulties to deal with from another quarter, for,
under the instigation of England, the Turks were preparing to retake
Egypt, and two armies were now on the way with this object. One of
them was to proceed through Asia Minor and Syria; to meet the enemy
Napoleon, with the bulk of his army, advanced through Syria, conquering
towns as he proceeded with his usual unbroken fortune. The march was
signalized by spectacular deeds of personal prowess on the part of his
subordinate generals. But he also shocked his admirers by the horrible
massacre of 3000 prisoners at Jaffa. The excuse for this deed of
bloodshed was that the victims had been previously released on parole
and had broken it by taking part in the defense of Jaffa. The first
failure in this unexampled course of success came at St. John d’Acre,
an important seaport which was obstinately defended by its Turkish
garrison, aided by an English commodore, Sidney Smith. After two
unsuccessful assaults had been made by the French, with heavy losses,
Napoleon withdrew in unconcealed disgust at his failure. He never
forgot Sidney Smith, and spoke of him always as the man who had spoiled
his luck; “that idiot [bicoque] was the only thing,” he said, “that
prevented me from entering India and striking a deathblow at England.”After the raising of the siege hope of further progress through Syria
was abandoned, and the army, suffering from illness and discontent, had
a miserable march back to Egypt, their route being marked by dead and
dying. Napoleon showed great constancy in this disastrous experience,
exposing himself to the ravages of the plague and restoring the
confidence of his men by his coolness. On reaching Egypt the French
found that a Turkish army of 18,000 men had disembarked at Alexandria;
these, however, were soon disposed of at the second battle of Aboukir,
fought almost a year after the first (July 25, 1799). The Turkish
soldiers who refused, or were not able, to reembark on their transports
were thrown into the sea.While the expedition was marked by such deeds of barbarism, it had
a more justifiable side because of the civilized and progressive
administration given to Egypt by its French conquerors. Intelligent
efforts were made to conciliate the Mussulman population; justice,
finance, and administration were reformed; even a beginning was made in
establishing something resembling representative government. Works of
public utility were encouraged, some planned on a large scale, such as
the building of a canal at Suez, a project only realized many decades
afterwards. Remarkable also were the scientific results attained
through the foundation of an Egyptian Institute consisting of French
specialists in archeology, architecture, and art. Among its members
were men who devoted themselves to promoting an industrial reformation,
while others accomplished hygienic improvements for the cities. Indeed,
the most durable result of this extraordinary scheme of Oriental
conquest was the primacy of culture it gave to France in Egypt, a
primacy she has continued to maintain even in the face of the military
occupation of the country by England.
III THE FALL OF THE DIRECTORY
During the long absence of Napoleon from France, the incapacity
of the government of the Directory at home and abroad had been
continually manifested; there were internal disorders due to royalist
insurrections, which seemed for a time most threatening in the
southwest, in the Garonne valley, while at Paris the radicals, who
represented what was left of the Terrorist element, were restless
under a system which they charged with disloyalty to the revolutionary
tradition. There was, besides, no harmony between the legislative and
executive organs of government; the Directors were not respected, some
being manifestly incompetent, others, like Barras, mere intriguers.With this weakness at home there had been displayed towards other
European powers a consistent policy of provocation and aggression. To
all of its weaker neighbors, France, in the hands of the Directory,
played the rôle of an absolute dictator; all of them were to be forced,
willing or unwilling, to organize themselves on the model of the French
Republic. Napoleon had set the fashion in Italy; this example was
followed through French influence and by French aggression. When the
Swiss cantons rose to defend their ancient rights, they met with no
more consideration than the absolute monarch, King Charles Emmanuel IV
of Piedmont, whose Italian dominions were annexed to France, or the
clerical oligarchy of Rome, who had to see themselves despoiled of
their temporal power, when the Roman Republic was proclaimed from the
Forum by General Berthier.A new European coalition was brought into existence to resist the
general movement of French expansion and to restore the Bourbon
monarchy by invading French territory. Much was hoped from the
accession of Russia, which along with Austria, engaged to put in the
field the largest masses of men. At the opening of the campaign the
French met discouraging defeats; Italy was soon lost through the
inability of the French generals to withstand the united Russians and
Austrians. In Switzerland, Masséna, by brilliant strategy kept the
coalition armies in check; while by the superior initiative of a much
smaller French force, a British army, operating in Holland, was obliged
to sign an ignominious treaty and to evacuate Dutch territory.With some of these vicissitudes of the Directorial government, Napoleon
became acquainted at a dinner, at which he and Sidney Smith met to
discuss matters relative to the exchange of prisoners and where the
commander of the French army in Egypt received the public papers and
letters intended for him which had been seized by English warships.
Napoleon saw the necessity of leaving Egypt, where he was cooped up
by an English fleet, and also he must have realized that the chance
of a permanent French occupation was infinitesimal. With a few of his
generals he left the country suddenly on the 22d of August, 1799,
and, avoiding by skilful navigation the danger of being captured by
the British warships, disembarked on French soil at Fréjus on October
16th. All parties greeted his return; his trip to Paris was a triumph;
the _Moniteur_ reported that the crowd on the roads was so great that
vehicular traffic was completely blocked. All the places through
which he passed from Fréjus as far as Paris were illuminated. Even
the Directory disguised their real feelings and gave the hero of the
Egyptian campaign a cordial welcome back. Bonaparte won much favor by
a discreet modesty of demeanor, ingratiating himself with the generals
who were defending France against the coalition, while he represented
the Egyptian campaign as an affair undertaken simply for scientific
purposes. His popularity was as unrestrained as it was real. The press
was filled with stories about him; he dressed as an ordinary citizen
rather than as a soldier, wearing a semi-civilian costume at social
functions.But under this ingenuous pose much political intriguing was being
set in motion. Napoleon, who was described by one of his brothers
as “just as much a manipulator as a general,” was planning with
Director Siéyès, now recognized as the chief political expert, to
be called in to prepare a new constitution. Napoleon cared nothing
for constitutions, but he was glad to have Siéyès’s influence in
overturning the Directory. Siéyès, on his side, recognized the civic
virtues of his friend, General Bonaparte, but at the same time
anticipated that the result of all this scheming would be to establish
him in a position where he would exercise sole autocratic rule.As to whether the opportunity was favorable, there was a difficulty.
France was no longer directly menaced by the coalition since the
splendid campaign of Masséna in Switzerland; besides, the royalist
insurrections had been suppressed, and the extremists muzzled. The
middle classes, to whom the wealth of the nation now belonged, felt
secure. At this time the Prussian Minister at Paris wrote that
confidence was being restored throughout the country, and that
even religious dissensions had become less acute. Some of the most
questionable and unpopular legislation, passed against the fortunes and
persons of citizens who were suspected by the Directory, was on the
point of being withdrawn by the legislative body. The debate on these
measures was to conclude on the 17th Brumaire.There was a difference between the two bodies of the legislature on the
question of the change of the constitution. The more popular chamber
distrusted Siéyès and passed upon him an indirect vote of censure of
a severe character, by threatening with death anyone who proposed to
alter the existing form of government. Apparently Napoleon’s share in
Siéyès’s scheme was not suspected, for the Five Hundred named as their
speaker Lucien Bonaparte, who had taken an oath to stab to death anyone
aiming to make himself dictator. The complicity of various generals
being assured by Bonaparte, Siéyès, who could count on the inactivity
or sympathy of his fellow-Directors, proceeded to set the machinery in
motion by which the government was to be overthrown. When the Ancients
met, they listened to a vague harangue by one of Siéyès’s adherents,
who spoke of a conspiracy, by which the country was threatened, the
intimation being conveyed that it was instigated by some foreign power.
To escape from impending danger a resolution was offered that both
houses should meet outside Paris on the 19th of Brumaire at St. Cloud,
and that the command of the troops in Paris should be turned over to
Bonaparte.As soon as this was done, there was a great display of military
activity. The city was placed in a state of siege, and care was
taken that the minority of the Directors should be kept as virtual
prisoners in the Luxembourg. The opponents of the change in the Five
Hundred had time enough to prepare for resistance, and they did
not propose to annul the existing constitution on the basis of a
rumor. Napoleon appeared first before the Ancients, where he made an
incoherent speech, and showed himself unable to name the conspirators
he charged with disloyalty against the country. When he was ushered
into the Hall where the Five Hundred were in session, the whole body
had just sworn allegiance to the Directorial Constitution. Walking
between four grenadiers, his diminutive figure added no gravity to the
scene; he was pale, disturbed, and undecided. The members refused to
listen to him, and cried “outlaw” or “down with the traitor.” It is
alleged that in the tumult daggers were drawn, and that Napoleon was
in personal danger, as his adversaries closed round him. But all that
happened, according to the most reliable witnesses, was that Napoleon
and his escort were jostled and finally ejected from the hall. One
grenadier, it is known, had the sleeve of his coat torn. Lucien, who
rose to defend his brother, was hissed, and finally gave up his place
as presiding officer. Another conspirator, when he refused to pass
a motion depriving Napoleon of his command, was replaced by Lucien
Bonaparte, who, on his part, collapsed from the nervous strain when
he was bidden to put the motion declaring Napoleon an outlaw. He was
allowed to go out and find his brother, so that the whole matter might
be peaceably settled without extreme measures being taken.In the meantime the leading conspirator, Napoleon, was suffering
from a nervous crisis. When he was outside the hall, he appeared to
observers as if he were walking in his sleep; upon trying to address
his troops from horseback, he fell to the ground. Lucien just then
came on the scene and conveyed him to a room in the palace, where
Siéyès said to him: “They wish to put you outside the law; we’ll
put them outside the hall.” The story of the display of daggers was
now concocted, and Napoleon’s troops were told of the danger their
commander had been in. Lucien directed the soldiers to go into the hall
and clear out the legislature. This order was executed by two companies
of armed grenadiers, who, despite the protests of the deputies, pushed
them good-humoredly out of the building, taking some of the members who
resisted, in their arms.The Ancients set forward their part of the revolution by voting the
suppression of the Directory, by appointing an executive commission
of three members, and by demanding the adjournment of the whole
legislative body. But to give the transaction a specious form of
legality, Lucien called some of the members of the Five Hundred
together, and they, under his direction, proceeded to behave as if
they were a majority. An executive consular commission was appointed,
composed of Siéyès, Ducas, and Bonaparte, to be called the Consuls
of the French Republic. During the adjournment of the legislature,
the powers of that body were to be exercised by a commission composed
of twenty-five members of each branch. These two commissions were
to decide on the measures initiated by the Consuls in matters of
administration and finance and also on the changes in the constitution
required to free it from its imperfections. This proposal was accepted
by the Ancients, and the three Consuls swore to be faithful to the
republic, one and undivided, to liberty, to equality, and to the
representative system.The news of the suppression of the Directorial régime caused suspense,
but little excitement. People were puzzled rather than alarmed; there
had been so many transformations since 1789 that one more seemed
hardly irregular. Besides, the Directory had often violated their own
constitution; hence the illegality in their suppression was regarded
as nothing strange. The Paris workmen stayed quietly in their quarters;
there was no Jacobin Club to champion the cause of the radicals or to
act as a center of protest. Financial circles were reassured, when
government securities rose; there was a difference of seven francs
between the quotations on the 17th Brumaire and 24th of the same month.The royalists were happy, for they were naïve enough to believe that
Napoleon would play the rôle of General Monk in a Bourbon restoration.
On the whole, at Paris and in the country, the masses of the people
were apathetic; some clubs here and there protested and called upon the
citizens to arm themselves in defense of the dead government, while
some departmental officials were dismissed, because they questioned the
legality of the changes at Paris. But nowhere was there anything like
an uprising in behalf of the Directory, which too forcibly recalled the
terrible years of revolutionary experience.
IV THE FIRST CONSUL
The provisional consuls remained in control from November 11 to
December 24, 1799. Napoleon presided at the first meeting because
his name began with “B,” it having been arranged that the consular
power should be exercised in alphabetical order. The Consuls seemed
to have no more authority than the Directors they had superseded.
Governmental policy was still anonymous. Napoleon never appeared in
public life except with his two colleagues, and his influence was
exerted altogether in military affairs, in which he exercised the
functions that Carnot had held under the Committee of Public Safety.
He dressed as a civilian, not as a general. Moreover, the Consuls
showed themselves most conciliatory; they published no magniloquent
program and behaved as if the lawlessness which had ushered in their
rule was something foreign to their own desires. No one talked of a
military dictatorship; there was, indeed, a studied moderation in the
new government. It is true a few Jacobins were placed under police
supervision, but some of the members of the revolutionary convention
were used as agents to reassure the good republicans throughout the
country. Among the deputies who had been expelled on the famous 19th
Brumaire, several made their peace with the government, while the
irreconcilables carefully avoided any overt acts in opposing it. The
republican tradition was maintained by manifestoes against superstition
and the émigrés. An era of good feeling was now ushered in most
auspiciously.Napoleon seemed to be content with the rôle of a Washington, but
the moment he saw there was no fear of resistance he took steps to
secure the adoption of a constitution fitted to make him the master
of France. The machinery for this purpose was near at hand in the two
legislative commissions mentioned above. Siéyès was working hard on
a model constitution which was to be a marvelous harmony of various
democratic principles. According to this scheme the people were to draw
up a list of candidates, while an elector chose from the list those who
should carry on the administration. The government was placed in the
hands of a Council of State, there were additional bodies to act as
representatives or as checks to keep the proper balance and to repress
personal ambition and demagoguery. There was, besides this, a scheme to
revive the Directory with the names of its constituent parts changed.Bonaparte, who saw no chance for personal rule in either of these
proposals, organized a small sub-committee to which he presented
a scheme of his own, that never really went before either of the
committees in a regular session, but was signed individually by the
members under pressure from him. It was carefully planned, but the
project that had such an irregular origin was nothing more than a
sham constitution. It contained no declaration of rights and had no
reference to liberty of the press. But the most shrewdly planned
scheme for centralizing the power in the hands of one man was revealed
in the so-called electoral provisions, by which the citizens of each
district prepared, by voting for one-tenth of their number, a communal
list from which all officials were to be selected. This system was
carried through several gradations, until a national list was reached,
from which all the higher popular representatives were to be chosen.
The right of nomination from these various lists was conferred, in
vague and ambiguous language, upon the First Consul. After the lists
were once drawn up no further change could be made in these provisions.Bonaparte transferred to himself the right of appointing all the
local officials, the members of municipal and departmental councils,
and so by a stroke of his pen deprived France of all trace of
local government. His plan brought into existence an intensified
centralization such as the country had not known, even under the
ancient monarchy. All laws had to be proposed by the executive
government; among the various representative bodies, the Senate,
Council of State, Tribunate, and Legislative bodies, power was so
divided that no single one had an effective initiative.All the real power was placed by the constitution under the control of
the First Consul. According to Article 41, the First Consul promulgated
the laws; he nominated and recalled at will the members of the Council
of State, ministers, ambassadors and chief foreign agents, the officers
of the army and navy, the members of the local administration, and the
legal solicitors of the government. He named all the civil and communal
judges of the Court of Appeal. As to the second and third Consuls, they
had only a consultative share in the executive power; to the Senate was
given the function of selecting the three Consuls, but the constitution
itself designated those who were to be invested with the authority for
the first period of ten years. They were Bonaparte, Cambacérès, and Le
Brun.The constitution was presented to the people for a “plébiscite;” that
is each citizen was to inscribe opposite his name on a register “yes”
or “no.” But this was not done everywhere on the same day; in fact,
it lasted several weeks, and so there was time to put pressure on
different localities, and also an arrangement was made by which the
new government was installed before the plébiscite was completed. Most
Frenchmen wanted peace at home and abroad, and as the government was
adopting a general policy of reconciliation, they were glad to give it
their support, all the more because they had no real constitutional
traditions and were sick of emotionalism and rhetoric. The result of
the voting was 3,011,007 ayes and only 1562 noes. Among those on the
affirmative side were a number of sturdy Jacobins.In his administration, Bonaparte relied chiefly on the Council of
State; he was in close relations with them, because all laws had to
be drawn up in this body. He often presided at their meetings and
in his remarks to them explained his ideas and his program. He did
not hesitate to treat their projects as actual laws, although the
constitution provided for a submission to other representative bodies.One of the first acts of the new régime was the passing of severe press
laws. Thirteen papers were allowed in Paris, but they were threatened
with suppression if they published articles contrary to the respect
due to the social compact, the sovereignty of the people, and the
glory of the armies; or if they published attacks on the government
or on nations friendly or allied with the Republic, even if the
articles in question were taken from the foreign press. This enactment
of 27 Nivose, year VIII, may be justly said to have inaugurated the
Napoleonic despotism.Another law presented and accepted was a measure which destroyed all
communal and local rights, and turned over the whole administration
in town and country to prefects and sub-prefects, appointed by, and
responsible to, the central government. Mayors, acting mayors, and town
and county councilmen were all appointed by either the First Consul or
his appointees, the prefects.The body known as the Tribunate, which discussed the laws and gave
its opinion upon them, and the Legislative Chamber, which voted upon
them without discussion, adopted this measure, the first with a strong
minority against it, who voiced, by vigorous speeches, their protests
against the suppression of all liberty. But the press was muzzled,
and there was general satisfaction because of the admirable selection
made by Napoleon for the subordinate officials. The new administration
was simple and effective, and had not yet shown the possibilities of
tyranny it contained.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'As to the First Consul, though he took up his residence in the
Tuileries, there was no consular court; republican etiquette was
observed, and the title of citizen was still retained. When the news
of Washington’s death reached Paris, mourning was ordered in the name
of the principles of liberty and equality. But the new tendencies
were shown in the favor extended by the First Consul to men of strong
monarchical sympathies. Napoleon, however, was soon occupied with more
momentous questions than the discovery of fresh means to paralyze
republican institutions in France.After the withdrawal of Russia from the anti-French coalition,--a step
which was due to the victories of Masséna,--Austria, England, and
some of the lesser states of Italy and Germany, kept up the conflict.
Bonaparte had no desire to see the war terminated, but he so far bowed
to public sentiment as to write letters to the King of England and
to Francis II, the Emperor, suggesting a cessation of hostilities.
England refused to make peace except on the condition that the Bourbons
should be restored, and Austria declined to take any action without the
consent of her ally. The publication of the correspondence appealed to
French patriotism, and the answer of the nation was a vote of 200,000
conscripts to carry on the war.For the purpose of invading France, Austria had two armies in the
field, each of 120,000 men. The French forces under Moreau and Masséna
were told off to keep the Austrians in check in Germany and along the
Italian Riviera; Bonaparte himself planned with a third army to drive
them out of Italy, in a second campaign which was to be the replica of
his first in Italy. Both Moreau and Masséna showed great capacity in
carrying out the strategical plans assigned to them. Bonaparte gathered
together an army of 60,000 and suddenly crossed the St. Bernard pass
by a march in which the French engineers showed remarkable skill in
overcoming the natural difficulties of the way. The commander-in-chief
made the passage on the back of a mule, as many tourists still do, led
by a peasant-guide of the neighborhood. On the top, the soldiers were
hospitably received at the famous monastery. The chief problem was to
get the artillery over, and this was done by dismounting the guns and
fastening them within hollowed-out trunks of trees. They were then
dragged along the precipitous path by relays of 100 men.While the Austrian general, Melas, was looking for the French along the
Riviera road, Bonaparte was making his entrance into Milan, where the
stupid excesses of recent Austrian rule had made the population forget
the more intelligent or subtle tyranny of the French conqueror. Instead
of rescuing Masséna, who was suffering the extremities of a siege at
Genoa, he preferred to leave him to his fate and to risk deciding the
campaign by a pitched battle with an enemy much stronger in numbers
than himself. These hazards were plainly seen in the engagement that
followed at Marengo on June 14, 1800. Three times the French were
forced to withdraw, and Melas was sending off couriers to announce
his victory, when Desaix, who had been sent, the day before, to Novi
to prevent a turning movement on the part of the Austrians, heard the
cannonading and came to the aid of his leader. A fresh charge was made,
and the ground that had been lost was regained. The first to fall was
Desaix, the man who had saved the day. The effect of the victory was
instantaneous, for the day afterward, Melas signed an armistice, by
which warfare was to be stopped for five months, in which time the
Austrians were to evacuate the whole of Italy as far as the Mincio.When the war was resumed later, French successes continued, until
finally the whole of the Italian peninsula was brought once more under
French control. After Marengo, the decisive battle of the campaign,
which brought Austria to sue for peace, was Moreau’s victory at
Hohenlinden, the 2d of December, 1800, on which occasion the Austrians
lost in killed and wounded 20,000 men. The victory brought forth from
Bonaparte the public acknowledgment, made before the legislative body,
that Hohenlinden was one of the finest achievements in history, and
he also wrote to Moreau saying that he, Bonaparte himself, had been
outdone. He afterwards criticised Moreau, and ascribed his victory to
mere chance, saying that his opponent, the archduke, had shown greater
strategical ability than the commander of the French army.As the result of these various operations, came the peace of Lunéville,
February, 1801, which marked the complete humiliation of Austria.
In its main lines it followed the stipulations of Campo Formio, but
it added the demand that the Dutch and Swiss republics should be
recognized as states under French protection. Moreover, the Pope was
allowed to retain some of his territory, and the King of Naples also
benefited by Napoleon’s moderation towards monarchical governments.England, now left alone as the sole enemy of France, had been enabled,
by her control of the sea, to make a clean sweep of the French
colonies. She acquired Malta, and forced the French to abandon Egypt.
But English supremacy at sea was resented on the Continent, a league
of neutrals was formed, and the Russian government showed distinct
signs of drawing towards France, after the refusal of England to
restore Malta to its ancient owners, the Knights of St. John. Portugal
was detached from England, and Spain was brought into such friendly
relations that she ceded to France the territory of Louisiana, which
had been in her possession since 1763.England’s isolation was unpopular at home because the enormous
accumulation of war debts was dreaded, and the threats of Napoleon
to invade the country were taken seriously, after he had established
an armed camp at Boulogne. William Pitt, the soul of resistance to
France, had left the government on account of differences over the
Irish question. His successor, Addington, was not averse to coming
to an agreement. After the signing of certain preliminaries in London
the terms of peace, as the result of a five months’ discussion between
Lord Cornwallis and Joseph Bonaparte at Amiens, took the form of a
treaty named from that place on March 25, 1802, between France, Spain,
and the Dutch republic on one side, and England on the other. Most of
the colonial conquests made by England were restored to their owners.
Egypt was returned to Turkey, and England agreed to return Malta to the
Knights of St. John and at the same time undertook not to interfere in
the internal affairs of Holland, Germany, Switzerland, and the Italian
republics.Bonaparte became the hero of peace as he had been already of war.
His popularity, due to his splendid achievements on the battlefield,
was now enhanced by the victories of French diplomacy. His rule was
firmly established; a new era of harmony and happiness seemed to
be opening up under his auspices. His unconstitutional methods of
government were forgotten in the brilliancy of his successes. But
there were many things that showed his anti-republican animus, and
his mania for autocratic rule. Before he set out for the Austrian
campaign three Paris papers were suppressed, and censorship for the
theaters was reintroduced. His taking command of the army was a step
not contemplated by the constitution of which he was the author. While
he was absent, it is true that the executive power was placed in the
hands of Cambacérès, who proved so efficient that Bonaparte hurried
back to Paris, immediately after Marengo, in order to resume the reins
of government.The members of the Tribunate showed their feelings by eulogizing
the heroism of Desaix and relegating the First Consul to a second
place. But Bonaparte’s return from Italy called forth a great wave of
enthusiasm throughout the masses of the nation, that showed him he
could go far in repressing the opposition of the republican party,
which was strongly intrenched in the Tribunate. On December 24, 1800,
the life of the chief executive had been endangered by a plot, and
while Bonaparte was driving to the opera there was an explosion by
which four people were killed and sixty wounded near his carriage.Though it was clear that the authors of the outrage were royalist
sympathizers, Bonaparte insisted that the Jacobins were its
instigators, and took this opportunity of diminishing the ranks of
the opposition by an edict of the Council of State, executed without
the sanction of the Tribunate and Legislative Body, that deported 130
republicans to distant colonial possessions. Towards other less known
opponents harsh measures were used, some of them being executed on
charges of conspiracy, trumped up by the police. Even the wives and
widows of former revolutionary leaders were imprisoned without trial,
and fifty-two citizens notorious for their democratic sentiments were
forbidden to reside in Paris or its neighborhood.In certain parts of the country royalist brigands were at work,
wreaking vengeance on individuals who had taken an active part in the
revolution or pillaging the houses of those who had bought confiscated
property. Taking advantage of the demand for increased security against
such outrages, Bonaparte created special tribunals, in which the
judges were partly army officers, authorized to deal with all crimes
of a nature calculated to disturb the government. With such elastic
provisions, it was easy to turn the machinery of these courts against
obnoxious republicans. There was no appeal against the decision made by
this body except on the ground of jurisdiction. In this way a sort of
revolutionary tribunal was erected, which Bonaparte could use for the
purpose of wreaking his own personal vengeance.Opposition in the so-called representative bodies was crippled by
various clever devices. For example, after the return from Italy, when
the period had come for the retirement by lot of a fixed number of
representatives in the Tribunate and the Legislative Body, the Senate,
which was loyal because filled by nomination of the second and third
Consuls, intervened and designated those of the representative chambers
who should continue to hold office. In this way 320 men, who had made
themselves obnoxious by their criticism or by their opposition, were
got rid of. Yet even after this purification all independence was not
destroyed. It was necessary to employ devious methods to secure for
Bonaparte, after the peace of Amiens, his appointment as Consul for
life. When the matter was proposed by Cambacérès, so often used as
the First Consul’s agent rather than as his colleague, the Tribunate
intimated that the recompenses for the First Consul’s services should
be purely honorary. Even the Senate contented itself with re-electing
Bonaparte for another term as First Consul in advance of the expiration
of his first term of office.Upon this Bonaparte wrote to the Senate that he preferred to appeal
to the people to know if he should impose upon himself the sacrifice
of prolonging his magistracy. Using the more pliable Council of
State, Cambacérès extracted from them an edict for a plébiscite to
be submitted to the people, who were asked whether the First Consul
should be named for life and whether he should be allowed to designate
his successor. After these illegal preliminaries, for there was no
formal authority for the plébiscite from the representative bodies, the
single question of the consulate for life was voted upon on August 2,
1802, with the result that there were 3,568,885 affirmative votes and
8374 negative. The increase in affirmative votes of 500,000 over the
plébiscite of two years before, shows how many royalists had rallied to
the consular system, in response to the favor shown them by the amnesty
lately given to émigrés and to manifest their appreciation of the
Concordat by which the First Consul had made his peace with the Church.It is significant that on the registers almost none of the names of
members of the Constituent Assembly or of the Convention appear. The
men of 1789 had accepted the Consulate two years before, but they now
abstained from voting. Of the negative votes most came from the army.
At Ajaccio, Bonaparte’s native city, out of 300 men of the garrison
there were 66 noes. Among others, Lafayette voted against the project,
stating in a letter to Bonaparte that the 19th Brumaire had saved
France, that the dictatorship had healed its ills, but that he did not
wish to accept, as the final result of the revolution, an “arbitrary
government.”The next step was to secure the right of appointing a successor.
Bonaparte had shown at first an apparent reluctance to accept the
suggestion, when it was made as a proposition to be submitted to the
people. Now, when it was made a part of a measure entitled “Organic
changes in the Constitution of the year VIII” (i.e., 1800), it was
passed without any real debate by the Council of State and accepted
by the Senate without discussion. At the same time it was arranged
that nominations to the Senate were to be made from a list prepared by
the First Consul; this practically meant, as the Senate’s membership
was still far short of its full quota, that the right assigned to it
of accepting or rejecting the successor of the First Consul was only
nominal. This situation of dependence made the Senate a useful body to
Bonaparte; accordingly its constitutional powers were increased, it
being given among other new prerogatives the right of dissolving the
Tribunate and the Legislative Body. The Senate’s omnipotence simply
concealed the figure of the First Consul, who set his puppets there in
motion.So reconstructed, the whole machine worked marvelously. The Council
of State, after showing signs of independence, was made a purely
decorative body, its real power being handed over to a private council
named by the First Consul. The Tribunate was to be reduced to fifty
members after a short interval. All relics of direct popular election
disappeared, and to the functions of the First Consul were added the
rights of ratifying treaties and remitting judicial sentences.As a sop to public opinion, the number of electors, who chose the lists
of candidates from which were selected the officials in the local and
central government, was increased, largely by doing away with the
property qualification, a curious feature of the early more radical
republican constitutions. There were, it is true, elections, electors,
and elected candidates, but all were under the direct or indirect
control of the arch manipulator, the First Consul, who crowned the
whole system.From this period begins the departure from the external signs of
republican simplicity. The First Consul was no longer Citizen
Bonaparte, but Napoleon Bonaparte; the anniversary of his birth was
celebrated by a ministerial decree. Like a sovereign the new ruler
had his civil list, and in his residence, the Tuileries, he began to
display the ostentatious character of court life. Military dress was
abandoned, and it began to be the fashion again to wear one’s hair
in a cue and to use powder, although the First Consul still appeared
with his own hair dressed in the revolutionary manner. Josephine took
much interest in reorganizing her household after the model of the old
régime; in the exercise of her taste she was allowed to go far, but it
was remarked that women had no political influence in the new court.Judged by contemporary opinion, one of the plainest steps taken by
Bonaparte towards a monarchy was the inauguration of the Legion of
Honor, having at its head the First Consul, assisted by a great
council, subordinate to which there were 1500 posts, each with 27
officers of various degrees, and 350 legionaries. This institution,
which was endowed by national funds, was composed of members
distinguished by their services to the Republic either as soldiers or
as civilians. They pledged themselves among other things to oppose any
enterprise tending to re-establish the feudal system, or proposing to
reproduce the titles and the characteristics by which feudalism was
marked, and to do everything in their power to maintain liberty and
equality.But these republican sentiments did not protect the measure from
criticism. It was opposed both in the Council of State and in the
Tribunate, where there was only a majority of sixteen in its favor when
it was finally passed. Even the Legislative Body made difficulties,
as is seen in their recorded vote of 170 for and 110 against. But it
was not only from such shadows of representative government as were
still permitted to linger on, that opposition came to Bonaparte’s
personal rule. Moreau, the hero of the Hohenlinden campaign, was known
to have sturdy republican sentiments. Moreover, there was Bernadotte,
the commander of the eastern army, who was openly discontented and was
supposed by many to have instigated a plot against the First Consul at
Rennes. There were, indeed, a series of military plots at this time,
but the knowledge of their existence was suppressed by the government,
whose object it was to impress on public opinion at home and abroad the
popularity of the consular system.The Legislative Body and the Tribunate busied themselves with
subordinate affairs such as laws governing the practice of medicine
and the organization of a notary public system. In the Senate the
hand of the First Consul was seen in the liberal financial provisions
for certain senators, who were allowed a suitable house and 25,000
francs annual income. Of course the selection of the beneficiaries of
these favors was left to the First Consul. There was no reluctance in
voting money and troops for the defense of the state, for by this time
Bonaparte’s personal policy and the national interests were closely
identified.This feeling of loyalty was all the more intensified when, after war
broke out again with England, the British government took a hand in
encouraging the schemes of various royalist groups. Among these were
some irreconcilable survivors of the Vendéan insurrection, led by
Cadoudal, who planned to remove Bonaparte by assassination, after which
it was assumed that a Bourbon restoration would follow as a matter of
course. Pichegru, an old revolutionary general, was an accomplice, and
the conspirators made an effort to secure the coöperation of Moreau,
but failed. Learning through his spies of this invitation, and glad of
a plea to rid himself of a rival, Bonaparte had Moreau arrested, though
he knew his innocence, and instigated a bitter press campaign against
him. Police agents encouraged the plot, hoping that some of the Bourbon
princes, certain of its success, might cross from England to France, in
expectation of Bonaparte’s death.In this atmosphere of plots, Bonaparte seems to have lost his head,
and to have descended to the weapons of revenge handed down among the
clansmen of his native island when they settled their domestic feuds.
One member of the Bourbon house was from this point of view as good
as any other, when it was a question of proving the capacity of the
government to deal with its monarchical enemies. The nearest victim
was selected for a stroke worthy of Cæsar Borgia--the Duke d’Enghien,
a distant relative of the direct heirs of the old monarchy, who had
been living quietly for two years at Ettenheim in Baden. A detachment
of dragoons was sent across the frontier, into the territory of a small
state, at peace with France, and arrested the young prince, March 15,
1804. The papers that were found showed clearly that the Duke was not
involved in the plot in any way, but in spite of this evidence of
non-culpability, he was tried by a commission made up of colonels of
the regiments of the Paris garrison.The prisoner was shot six days after his arrest, the sentence being
executed at the château of Vincennes. Though freed from any complicity
in the Pichegru plot, the Duke d’Enghien had tried to enter the
service of England against France; he had also fought against the
French Republic as an émigré, so whatever may be said in criticism of
the abject subservience of the officers who acted as judges in the
court-martial, it must be remembered that the law of the revolutionary
period, by which the death penalty was inflicted upon any Frenchman
engaged in open warfare against his country, had never been abrogated.
Probably it was to this justification of his act that Napoleon referred
when he refused to listen to Josephine’s entreaties in behalf of the
Bourbon prince. “I am,” he said, “a man of the State. I am the French
Revolution, and I shall uphold it.” These words were spoken in a moment
of typical exaltation. After many years had passed he commented in the
following way on his action: “The deserved death of the Duc d’Enghien
hurt Napoleon in public opinion, and was of no use to him politically.”
There soon followed a report of Pichegru’s suicide in his prison, a way
of accounting for his death which, after the execution of the Bourbon
Duke, it was hard to accept as satisfactory. Many believed that he was
assassinated at Bonaparte’s command because the publicity of an open
trial was dreaded.
V THE INAUGURATION OF THE EMPIRE
From the excitement caused by these conspiracies came the movement
which led to the inauguration of the empire. Petitions were drawn up
asking that the consulate should be made hereditary in the Bonaparte
family; there was considerable reluctance in using explicitly the
word “empire,” and there was much wavering and intrigue before a
member of the Tribunate, Curie, offered a resolution on the 23rd of
April, 1804, according to the terms of which Napoleon Bonaparte, the
then First Consul, should be declared Emperor of the French, and the
imperial dignity should remain hereditary in his family. Carnot was
the only member who argued against the change, but his plea in behalf
of a régime of liberty found no supporters, though he pointed out in
frank language that the movement in favor of hereditary monarchy was
fictitious, because freedom of the press no longer existed. The Senate
acted quickly on the motion from the one popular body that now was in
session, for the Legislative Body was adjourned. A decree establishing
the imperial constitution was passed on May 18, 1804. The measure was
to be submitted to popular approval, but from the date of its passage
Bonaparte received the title of Emperor of the French, and the empire
actually came into existence. The international situation played a
considerable part in forcing the abandonment of the few remaining
vestiges of a republican system. Bonaparte had no desire to maintain
for any length of time the pose of an apostle of peace, which for the
sake of popularity he had assumed, while the negotiations at Amiens
were in progress. England, too, had no wish to fulfil the engagements
of that treaty, by which her power would be diminished. She was
interested in keeping both Malta and Alexandria, and her promise of
non-intervention on the Continent was very liberally interpreted by her
government.In the light of Bonaparte’s own policy a strict interpretation of
engagements would have been indeed a counsel of perfection, for his
plans for the expansion of France were not modeled on the traditions of
the eighteenth-century system of balance of power. He had schemes for
controlling the Mississippi valley, and he also elaborated a revival
of French colonial policy in which the possession of San Domingo was
the chief factor. When the revolted slaves of that island made it
impossible for the French troops to keep French administration intact,
Bonaparte gave up the enterprise, and sold Louisiana to the United
States for 80,000,000 francs. French agents and officers were sent to
the east of the Mediterranean and to India, with instructions obviously
intended to work for the downfall of British power and influence.
Only a month after the treaty of Amiens was signed, General Decaen,
notorious for his Anglophobia, was despatched to India, with secret
instructions to get into touch with the Indian princes who were hostile
to England’s rule, with the object of forming an alliance among them.
Moreover, the official government paper, the _Moniteur_, took no pains
to disguise the intention of the First Consul to organize, on the first
opportunity, a second expedition for the conquest of Egypt.On the continent of Europe, too, French aggression proceeded without
any disguise. Holland had virtually become a French dependency; and
it was now endowed with a consular régime. In Italy, Victor Emmanuel,
the King of Sardinia, was deposed, and his territories were annexed to
France. Not contented with being president of the Cisalpine Republic,
Bonaparte treated the rest of the peninsula as a subject territory
and sent garrisons to the south to important points in the Kingdom of
Naples. Just as plain was his attitude towards Switzerland, where he
made use of the internal dissensions in the cantons to increase French
influence. He told the Swiss delegates, when he had selected himself
to act as mediator in their disputes, that Europe recognized Italy,
Holland, and Switzerland as being under French control. “I will never
tolerate,” he added, “any other influence in Switzerland but mine, if
it is to cost me 100,000 men.”As to Germany, the rôle of protector and disposer of the smaller German
states was ostentatiously assumed. Russia, which had been given by the
treaty of Lunéville conjoint power with France in the rearrangement of
the petty German principalities, was treated with small consideration.
The work was done by Bonaparte, and its drastic character can be
measured by the statistics of the changes carried out under French
direction. In the eighteenth century there were from eighteen to
nineteen hundred autonomous sovereignties in Germany; only thirty-nine
survived in Bonaparte’s “New Model,” among them being six free cities
and one ecclesiastical domain. By these changes Prussia profited
considerably, but even more so Bavaria, because of its well-known
friendship for France.Under the cover of the Peace of Amiens, Bonaparte had become dictator
of a large part of Europe. Accordingly, when Lord Whitworth, the
English ambassador, protested in the name of the existing treaties,
Bonaparte replied, “I suppose you refer to Piedmont and Switzerland;
they are trifles; this could have been foreseen during the
negotiations.” The German publicist, Gentz, summarized the situation,
without exaggerating it. “France,” he said, “has no longer any
frontiers, since all that surrounds it is in fact, if not yet in name,
its property and domain, or will become so at the first opportunity.”On its side, England was far from scrupulous in observing the terms of
the Amiens convention, and showed notorious unfriendliness to France
in encouraging the various royalist plots against Bonaparte’s life.
Besides, the terms of the treaty were not carried out as regards the
evacuation of Malta or as to the conditions made for restoring to the
French certain towns in India. What was especially irritating to the
British government and people was Bonaparte’s plan to develop French
industry by adopting a protective system. He not only refused to sign
any treaty of commerce with England, but took active measures to close
the ports of France and of the states dependent on her to the products
of English industry. A violent press campaign was inaugurated in London
against the policy of the Consulate, couched in unsparing language
against Bonaparte’s character and ambitions. He, on his side, took up
a truculent attitude, saying in so many words that England’s effort to
secure new allies would force him to conquer Europe and to revive the
Empire of the West.In the spring of 1803, the final rupture came with a message from
George III that the security of England was menaced by France. The
outbreak of hostilities was marked by the seizure on England’s side,
without any declaration of war, of 1200 French and Dutch merchant
ships. Bonaparte replied to this act of piracy by another in kind,
though a more original violation of international justice; he arrested
all the subjects of England who were to be found on French territory,
and prohibited the purchase of any article of British manufacture. The
next step was to prepare for an invasion of England from the Channel
ports and for the military occupation of Hanover, an appanage of the
British crown. On the Continent, Pitt formed an alliance against the
aggressions of France, known as the Third Coalition. Austria, Prussia,
Sweden, and Naples prepared to act together, the chief military
contingents being supplied by Austria with three armies amounting in
all to 130,000 men, and by Russia, which promised four armies.As England controlled the sea power, Bonaparte’s preparations to invade
it were futile, though 2343 transports were collected, and for many
months an army of 120,000 were kept in training for the passage over
the Channel. But there was no adequate protecting fleet, and the French
officers showed no ability in using the vessels under their command.
The entrance to the Channel was guarded by English ships; all the
French ports were blockaded, and Villeneuve, the French admiral, in
an engagement off Trafalgar, was decisively beaten by Nelson, with a
loss of twenty men-of-war, out of a combined French and Spanish fleet
of thirty-five. Villeneuve was made the scapegoat for the failure of
the plan to invade England, but the scheme was a chimerical one from
the start, viewed in the light of the experiences of French armies in
San Domingo and in Egypt, where they were cut off from their base.
Many critics are, therefore, willing to believe that Napoleon was not
sorry to have been relieved by the loss of his fleet from undertaking a
spectacular but most hazardous adventure.Before the battle of Trafalgar, October 20, 1805, while Napoleon
was at Boulogne, he dictated a plan evidently the result of long
consideration, containing the most exact details for the march of
his army to the Danube. In the meantime, the Austrians had invaded
Bavaria, had taken possession of Ulm, and were awaiting the French in
the defiles of the Black Forest. With wonderful speed, precision, and
secrecy enveloping operations were carried out, by which Mack, the
Austrian general, who supposed the French army was near Strassburg,
when it had already cut his communications far to the east of his
forces, was surrounded and forced to capitulate. In this short campaign
of three weeks, 100,000 Austrians had been dispersed by remarkable
strategical movements, extending over a stretch of country several
hundred miles wide. Not an error had been committed, not a combination
had failed. The soldiers truly said, “The Emperor has beaten the enemy
by our legs.”Now that the Austrians were destroyed as a military entity, the
Russian armies in Austria remained to be attacked. By a series of
forced marches Vienna was reached by the middle of November without
any general engagement. The plan of the Austrian and Russian generals
was to cut off Napoleon, when he advanced farther into the heart of
the empire, in much the same way as he had treated Mack. They had the
advantage in numbers, for the French army now was only 68,000, while
the allies had 90,000. The co-operation of Prussia was expected by the
allies, if the Russians could win a victory, and with this additional
strength it was hoped that the whole French army would ultimately be
forced to capitulate.But Napoleon moved from Vienna with great rapidity and brought on a
decisive engagement at Austerlitz. Everything was done to increase the
confidence of the allies. They knew that the French were reduced, by
the detaching of thousands of men, needed to occupy Vienna and to keep
in check various divisions of the Austrian forces. In some skirmishes
the Austro-Russians were allowed to win small advantages, to put them
off their guard, and to induce them to offer battle on unfavorable
terms. Their two wings were adroitly separated from the center by
the French troops giving way at an opportune moment. Napoleon took
advantage of this weakness of the enemy’s center, while his commanders
were preventing the detached portion of the enemy’s forces from
returning to the main body, to drive the Russians, opposite him, on
the frozen surfaces of various ponds in the battlefield. He then used
his artillery to break the surface of the ice and so drowned several
thousand of the enemy.This brilliant engagement, fought on December 2, 1805, cost the allies
15,000 men in killed and wounded, 20,000 prisoners, 45 standards, and
140 cannon. Napoleon, delighted that the allies had walked into the
trap prepared for them, commended in the order of the day following the
battle, the conduct of his men. “I am contented with you,” he said.
“You have, on the great day of Austerlitz, justified what I expected
from your valor. When I lead you back to France, my people will see
you again with joy. It will only be necessary for you to say ‘I was at
the battle of Austerlitz’ for the reply to be made, ‘There is a brave
man.’” The Emperor might well be satisfied, for the renewal of warfare
had not been popular in France, where the defeat at Trafalgar had
caused depression and anxiety. Now all was forgotten in the glorious
victory which again placed the Austrian Empire at the mercy of the
conqueror.As the Austrians had been equally unlucky in defending their Italian
territories, the Treaty of Pressburg, December 20, 1805, showed how
greatly the traditional balance of power was altered, giving place
to Napoleon’s scheme for dominating the whole of Europe. Austria
lost the territories of Venice, Istria except Trieste, Dalmatia; she
recognized Napoleon as King of Italy and was forced to surrender
valuable possessions to the German princes who were allies of the
French. There was also a titular diminution of power, because Francis
II now surrendered the title of Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire,
which gave him a theoretical sovereignty over the German states, and
accepted the territorial title of hereditary Emperor of Austria. To
these extreme measures of humiliation Napoleon obstinately adhered,
though his foreign minister, Talleyrand, wisely preached moderation to
him, urging with unique diplomatic vision that if Austria were to be
deprived of so much territory in the west, there should be compensation
made for her losses by handing over to her Turkish provinces in the
lower valley of the Danube. France, he pointed out, would profit by
this act of generosity, for Austria would give up looking to England
for support, and, as a power in the East, would be certain to excite
the jealousy of Russia, because Russia had always looked to inherit the
Ottoman domains. But Napoleon’s plans would tolerate no scheme by which
any European state would be helped to preserve more than a fictitious
independent existence.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'After Austerlitz the Confederation of the Rhine was created, a league
of sixteen dependent German princes, of which the French Emperor was
the head. Bavaria and Wurtemburg were especially favored, receiving the
title of kingdoms, while their royal houses were drawn close into the
orbit of French influence by marriages with members of the Bonaparte
and Beauharnais families. Italy being now absorbed, Napoleon’s sisters
were rewarded with Italian principalities, while his brother Joseph
took the place of one of the Bourbons on the throne of Naples. Only
the Pope was left as an independent sovereign in the much reduced
temporal dominions of the Church. Holland, in accordance with the fully
developed imperial system, became a kingdom, in place of a republic,
with Louis, the Emperor’s brother, as its sovereign. Only one member
of the family proved recalcitrant to Napoleon’s plans, and, therefore,
was not rewarded in this division of the spoils of conquest. This was
Lucien, who had saved the day on the 19th Brumaire and had made it
possible for his brother to climb into absolute power. He refused to
divorce his wife and marry a princess, and, therefore, he shared none
of the favors that were being distributed. Napoleon’s mother, Letitia
Bonaparte, who took Lucien’s side in this quarrel, was never declared
a princess, and had to be satisfied with the honorary title of Madame
Mère. Napoleon had conferred upon himself officially the title of Great
(1806). His birthday was kept as a national and imperial holiday on
which was celebrated a quasi-religious feast of apotheosis, modeled
after the precedents of the Roman Empire.Although Austerlitz called forth a new distribution of the map of
Europe, and elevated, as if by a miracle, the members of the house of
Bonaparte, it did not give peace to France. Russia had not shared in
the Treaty of Pressburg, and even the English government, which, after
the death of Pitt, was headed by the liberal pro-French statesman
Fox, could make no satisfactory peace terms with the Emperor of the
French. Prussia, whose neutrality was suspected, was treated with
little consideration and no frankness by Napoleon’s government. It is
true that he handed Hanover to it, but he made no secret of the fact
that he would withdraw his gift provided that, if he restored Hanover
to England, that power would consent to make peace. There was an
active war party in Prussia who were anxious to try conclusions with
the French army, because they relied on the traditions of the perfect
military machine established by Frederick the Great. They boasted of
their ability to destroy Napoleon’s army which had only conquered
Austrians and Russians. Alexander of Russia was also anxious to renew
the conflict, and England poured out its treasures to the extent of
6,000,000 pounds.The result was the Fourth Coalition against France, made up of England,
Prussia, Russia, and Sweden. Hostilities began with an inflated
ultimatum from the King of Prussia, ordering Napoleon to evacuate
Germany and to give up the Confederation of the Rhine. The declaration
of war on the part of Prussia was most ill-timed, for the Austrians had
not yet recovered from the defeat of Austerlitz, and the Russians were
not prepared to act the part of effective allies at the beginning of
the campaign. To this carelessness in selecting the time for commencing
hostilities was added over-confidence in the military superiority of
the Prussian army. As a machine, it presented the outward semblance
of the creation of Frederick the Great; but there was an absence
of intelligent direction. The soldiers were badly treated under a
régime of poor diet and strict discipline, while the officers were a
privileged class, who remained in active service long after they had
passed the prime of life. This artificial system collapsed like a pack
of cards; as Heine said, “Napoleon breathed on Prussia and Prussia
ceased to exist.”In preparing for this new campaign, Napoleon repeated the strategy of
the Austerlitz campaign. He disguised, by feigned hostile movements and
by ostentatiously remaining in Paris, his intention of striking one
of his rapid, certain strokes at the enemy’s weakest spot. Led into a
false self-confidence, the Prussians took the offensive with 150,000
men. By means of quick concentration, Napoleon’s army was brought up to
a strength of 175,000. With this force, instead of coming into contact
with the Prussians on the northwest, as had been expected, he turned
their army on the southeast and threatened their communications with
Berlin. The victory was won by two skilfully conducted pitched battles,
at Jena and also at Auerstadt (the 14th of October, 1806), where
Davout, with an army much inferior to that opposed to him, specially
distinguished himself. The Prussian armies were reduced to a mass of
fugitives; there were 20,000 killed and wounded and 18,000 prisoners,
but the victory cost the French 12,000 men, for the Prussians had
fought bravely, though their generalship was poor.There was later a spectacular entrance into Berlin by the victorious
army, arranged after the manner of a Roman triumph, with the Prussian
regiment of the guards disarmed and following their conquerors.
Napoleon interpreted his victory as giving him a chance to show his
power of wreaking a personal vengeance on those who had so rashly
questioned his power. “I will render this court nobility so small,” he
said, “that they will be obliged to beg their bread.” He acted in the
spirit of these words, and outraged public sentiment by carrying off,
as part of the booty of Berlin, the sword of Frederick the Great. Over
the conquered country was extended a network of officials, intrusted
with the duty of collecting large money contributions. No community
was allowed to escape the imposition, and all were made to feel their
responsibility for the war. There was also a rearrangement of German
territories, under which Jerome, the Emperor’s youngest and least
competent brother, was provided with a throne under the title of King
of Westphalia.After the defeat of Prussia, the Russians, who had been slowly
drawing together great masses of men, kept up an obstinate struggle
against Napoleon’s generals, and little progress was made by the
French. Marbot describes the campaign in all its hardships; the
weather, he says, was terribly cold, but the troops seem to have
suffered even more in their marches from the thaws which rendered
the bad roads impassable. While the French army was encamped for the
winter, Benningsen, the Russian general, tried, early in February,
to force his way between the two divisions of the French army under
Ney and Bernadotte. The plan failed because Bernadotte was not taken
by surprise; his defense was a brilliant one, and gave Napoleon an
opportunity for attempting a turning movement on Benningsen’s army.
This purpose could not be carried out because the despatch announcing
it to the French subordinate commanders fell into the hands of the
Russians, who got away in time. In the pursuit, the Russians turned on
the French, and the result was a “soldiers’ battle,” fought at Eylau,
February 8, 1807, in which for a time the Emperor’s position was most
critical, for his army was half encircled and suffered terribly from
the enemy’s artillery fire. The day was finally saved by a remarkable
cavalry charge, led by Murat, who passed through three Russian lines
and broke up their attack. But despite this terrible massacre of men
at Eylau,--10,000 French and 30,000 Russians,--no final result was
attained by it. Neither side could claim to be victorious; it was
something, however, to prove that Napoleon was not invincible, and,
as Eylau was not a Russian defeat, the Russians interpreted it as a
victory. The two powers, Prussia and Russia, agreed not to make a
permanent treaty with France until the banks of the Rhine were accepted
as her frontiers.During the spring each side remained inactive, for both were in need
of reinforcements. Benningsen with 100,000 men took the offensive,
but after some preliminary hard fighting, placed himself, still on
the offensive, in an unfavorable position near Friedland. He had
brought his army into a narrow ravine with the river Alle behind him,
so that in case of a check he had only the bridges to depend upon for
withdrawing his men. These bridges were cut in a turning movement, made
by Ney, while Lannes, with 26,000 French against 82,000 Russians, kept
Benningsen from leaving his position, during a space of thirteen hours.
By the evening the Russian army had but 25,000 men under arms and was
hopelessly demoralized.After this defeat the Fourth Coalition was at an end. The Peace of
Tilsit was drawn up as the result of a personal interview between
Alexander of Russia and Napoleon on a raft anchored in the river
Niemen. After several private meetings Napoleon succeeded in attracting
to himself the enthusiastic sympathy of his obstinate opponent. There
was outlined a common plan of action by which both sides were to
benefit, Russia was to gain territory in Finland, at the expense of
Sweden, and in the East, at the expense of Turkey. Even more important
was the winning over of Alexander to agree to Napoleon’s continental
blockade against England, by which all English goods were to be kept
out of continental ports.But even by making this volteface in Russian policy, Alexander
could secure no favorable terms for his late ally, Prussia. That
power was denuded of territory to the east which it had originally
acquired in the partition of Poland; for of this was constructed one
of Napoleon’s new creations, the grand duchy of Warsaw, of which the
elector of Saxony, approved by Napoleon for his pro-French policy,
became sovereign with the title of King. On the west, all lands beyond
the Elbe were taken, to be added to the new kingdom of Westphalia.
Frederick of Prussia had besides to accede to the anti-British economic
measures of Napoleon, to pay a war indemnity of $20,000,000, and to be
humbly grateful for the return of four provinces in the northeast that
had been detached from Prussia after the battle of Jena.
VI AT THE ZENITH OF POWER
After Tilsit it was plain that Napoleon was no longer a French monarch;
his schemes of conquest were now not made in the interest of France,
for France, like the other powers of central Europe, was to be only
a province of a vast territorial empire, managed for the personal
profit of a single individual, who bestowed and took away power and
territory, according to his caprice. England still stood in his way
after his diplomatic success at Tilsit, but no armies were left to
oppose him. It seemed, therefore, a comparatively easy matter to master
England by cutting her off from the sources of her wealth. No power
or state was allowed to be neutral, for those who declared themselves
so were proscribed along with England (decree of Milan, 1807). A hard
fate awaited any refractory nation, for nationalism now lived only
on sufferance. To suspend the economic life of millions of people,
to transform habits of industry peculiar to sea-going populations
was to Napoleon’s mind no greater task than to annihilate armies
and partition kingdoms. From Tilsit dates the effort to attain the
impossible, and with it begins, in a succession of rapid changes, the
decline of the imperial system, the strain being greater than any
such artificial construction could bear. Externally the establishment
of peace consolidated Napoleon’s power and influence at home; the last
campaigns had been a severe drain, but the diplomatic success of Tilsit
compensated for the losses in the battlefield.Napoleon’s familiar method of using a period of peace for extending his
power at every weak point of contact was now resumed. Portugal, as a
state closely connected with England, was to be detached from British
influence by force of arms. Nor was any consideration to be paid to
Spain, loyal though she had been to France, her ally. A loyalty which
had cost her dear already became more fatal still when Napoleon began
to plan for a cession of Spanish territory and the substitution of a
member of his own house for the Bourbons. In the north, Denmark was to
be required to renounce her position of neutrality and to hand over her
valuable fleet of twenty ships to coöperate with the French. It was in
anticipation of this step, that an English fleet, outdoing the lawless
code of their adversaries, bombarded, in July, 1807, Copenhagen, the
capital of a state with which it was at peace, and seized the Danish
ships in the harbor.This was the act which drove Alexander into closer relations with
Napoleon, who adroitly used the opportunity for arranging a formal
alliance, by which common action against the English in the East, as
well as the West, might be secured. His plans in their full scope
are given in the following letter addressed to the Czar of Russia
in February, 1808: “An army of 80,000 men, Russian and French,
perhaps a few Austrians, which will advance on Asia by the road of
Constantinople, will not have to reach the Euphrates, to make England
tremble and bring her to our feet on the continent. I am ready on the
spot in Dalmatia, your Majesty is on the Danube. A month after we have
agreed to act, the army can be on the Bosphorus. The news of it will be
heard in India, and England will give in. I do not refuse to accept any
of the preliminary stipulations necessary to attain an end so great.
But the mutual interest of our two states should be well combined and
balanced. All can be signed and decided before the 15th of March. On
May 1, our troops can be in Asia, and at the same time your Majesty’s
troops in Stockholm. Then the English, threatened in India, chased
out of the Levant, will be broken under the weight of the events by
which the atmosphere will be charged. Your Majesty and myself would
prefer the enjoyment of peace and to pass our life in the midst of our
vast empires, busied in vitalizing them and making them happy by the
methods and benefits of our government. The enemies of the world will
not have it so. We must be greater in spite of ourselves. It is the
part of wisdom and policy to do what fate ordains and to go where the
irresistible march of events is leading us.... In these few lines I
am expressing to your Majesty my whole mind. The work of Tilsit will
regulate the destinies of the world. Perhaps so far as your Majesty and
I are concerned, a little pusillanimity would have us prefer a certain
actual good to a better and more perfect condition. But since, after
all, England does not wish it, let us recognize that the time for great
events and for great changes has come.”This vision Alexander desired to transform into hard realities without
delay; the first step was to divide the dominions of Turkey. The
question arose as to what disposition should be made of Constantinople
and the Dardanelles. But while the Russians were arguing as to the
proposed increase of territory in the Orient, Napoleon, without
consulting his correspondent at St. Petersburg, was manipulating the
situation in the West by the virtual annexation of Spain to France. The
haggling with Russia was dropped, and Napoleon hastened to embark in
the adventure which was ultimately to lead to his downfall.Disgust with Godoy, the court favorite, had brought about a
revolutionary movement in Spain, which aimed to substitute for
the reigning monarch, Charles IV, his son Ferdinand. These family
difficulties were laid before Napoleon, who traveled to Bayonne, post
haste from Paris, to act as arbitrator. With a duplicity worthy of a
profound student of Machiavelli, he caused to be placed in his hands an
abdication, signed by both the royal father and his son; the impartial
arbiter handed over the crown to a third party, his brother Joseph,
King of Naples. So, by a juggle that a sporting gamester might have
envied, a Bonaparte came to reside in the royal palace of Madrid, and
if kingships went by personal capacity, and not by descent, it must be
said that, mediocre as was Napoleon’s elder brother, he was far better
fitted for governing Spain than either the feeble Charles IV or his
scoundrelly son and heir, Ferdinand.Alexander heard of these transactions from the pen of his assiduous
correspondent, but he cared for none of these things; his mind was
filled with the spoliation of Sweden and Finland as a preliminary step
to realize his dream of Oriental conquest. It was arranged that the two
emperors should meet at Erfurt to settle the terms of their proposed
dual domination of the world; only by a personal interview could the
question as to the possession of Constantinople be decided. In the
meantime there were elaborate plans for the sailing of fleets to Egypt,
and around the Cape of Good Hope, to overawe the English.Events in Spain put an awkward stop to this program. The population
of the country had never been awakened by the French Revolution; they
hated foreign interference, and, when their Bourbon king was dethroned,
they rose _en masse_ in revolt, with the spirit of the Vendée. News
soon came to Paris of the defeat of a French army in which 18,000 men
surrendered. This defeat, the capitulation of Baylem, was soon followed
by a disaster to the army corps which was operating in Portugal against
a combined Portuguese and English force. The effect of the Spanish
resistance was enormous; in all parts of central Europe it revived the
hope of successful revolt against the domination of the French system.
It stirred Prussia and Austria to renewed efforts; there was great
activity of secret societies in Prussia, directed against the French
occupation, and Austria was busy in reorganizing its military forces
for a fresh struggle.Napoleon realized the critical situation; antedating his letter to
Alexander, to give the impression that it was written before the bad
news from Spain had reached him, he announced his purpose to withdraw
the French troops from Prussia, and promised to give up the Danubian
principalities, without compensation, provided Russia would be willing
to see that the Germans were kept quiet, and would influence Austria to
abandon her warlike preparations. Alexander showed much complacency,
even going so far as to express his sympathy for the eclipse of the
French arms in Spain.Nothing was spared at Erfurt, where the two emperors met, to impress
upon the world the security and the extent of Napoleon’s rule. It was
the fête of a cosmopolitan society, where men of distinction in all
spheres of life were brought together at the bidding of the Emperor of
the French. Goethe was present, also Talleyrand, who left on record
his impression of the atmosphere of adulation that prevailed. The two
central figures, Alexander and Napoleon, showed marked cordiality to
each other. Alexander spoke of his friend as not only the greatest
but the best of men. Yet there were visible rifts in the friendship;
Alexander refused to show hostility to Austria, an attitude which was
secretly encouraged by Talleyrand, who had begun to fear the result of
Napoleon’s grandiose schemes, and wished to make friends before fortune
turned. Napoleon proved obdurate, when Alexander urged upon him a more
generous treatment of Prussia.In the formal treaty, the result of the meeting, there was incorporated
a proposition of peace with England on the basis of the _status
quo_--i.e., Finland and the Danubian principalities for Russia and the
deposition of the Bourbons in Spain. Alexander would go no further as
regards Austria than the prospect of armed coöperation, if Austria went
to war against France. Among the subjects proposed was the marriage of
Napoleon with a Russian princess. He had been considering for some time
a divorce from Josephine, a plan now resolved upon after the birth of
an illegitimate son had convinced him that there was the possibility of
a direct heir. Alexander, encouraged by Talleyrand’s advice, refused
to make a frank engagement to forward this scheme, saying that to
his mother alone belonged the disposition of his sisters’ marriage
arrangements.After the meeting at Erfurt, Napoleon hastened to Spain, where,
fighting several successful battles, he restored his brother to his
capital at Madrid, and forced an English army under Moore to retreat
towards the sea coast. This was in January, 1809. Then Napoleon was
obliged to withdraw from Spain because of the threatening attitude of
Austria, now firmly resolved on opening hostilities with France. There
were also evidences brought him of a plot in Paris, the responsibility
for which rested on Talleyrand and Fouché, both long in service
under him. It was arranged between them that in case of a reverse or
a successful attempt on Napoleon’s life, they were to take charge
of the government, giving it a figurehead in the person of Murat,
Napoleon’s brother-in-law. Long before he was expected, Napoleon
appeared suddenly in Paris, having ridden from the north of Spain in
six days. For a while Talleyrand was in disgrace, but acts of personal
revenge were forgotten in the preparation for crushing Austria. It was
a most distasteful task, for he feared to break up his friendship with
Alexander, the necessary result of dismembering the Austrian Empire.
He therefore tried to secure the intervention of Russia, but Alexander
refused to act at all vigorously.Hostilities broke out in April, 1809. There was no longer a question
of purely dynastic interests in this armed protest of Austria against
the Napoleonic system; the army of 310,000 men represented a general
patriotic movement of self-defense that had penetrated all classes of
society in the Hapsburg dominions. It stood ready to resist the power
that was crushing out racial and territorial distinctions; it spoke
for a nation in arms conscious of its national right to exist. At home
the French Emperor had to deal now with a population that was weary
of warfare and satiated with military glory. To meet, on Austrian
territory, this massive attack of the Fifth Coalition, which was made
up of England, Spain, and Austria, there was no longer the material at
hand that had secured for the conqueror the brilliant achievements at
Austerlitz and Marengo. His latest army consisted of new recruits and
old soldiers from France and of levies from dependent states.Napoleon thoroughly appreciated the dangers of his position, as his
correspondence with his agent at the Russian court shows. He was most
urgent in inviting Alexander to play the part of an effective ally by
sending troops to Hungary and Galicia, a movement which would have
taken Austria between two fires. There were no longer vague promises
of reward held out, but specific engagements were offered as an
inducement for the Czar to act. “The three crowns of Austria could be
separated. When these last-mentioned states have been thus divided, we
can diminish the number of our troops, substitute for these general
enlistments of troops, which are tending to call even the women under
arms, a small number of regular troops and so change to the system of
small armies, as introduced by the late King of Prussia (Frederick
II). Our barracks can become poor-houses and the conscripts can stick
to their tillage. Even if it is wished after the conquest to guarantee
the integrity of the monarchy, I will agree to it provided there is a
complete disarmament.”Alexander showed a lack of interest in these proposals; on the other
hand, he let the Austrian government know that he hoped they would
be successful, promising at the same time that his alliance with the
French would be interpreted so formally, that the Austrians would
have nothing to fear from Russian armies. Yet in spite of these
diplomatic discouragements Napoleon lost none of his technical skill
in the campaign that followed. In five days (April 19-23, 1809) with
an army of 120,000 men, though the main Austrian army consisted of
175,000, he took 40,000 prisoners and 100 pieces of artillery. He
divided the enemy’s forces into separate divisions, both of which were
defeated, and so he opened up the road to Vienna. But the close of
the campaign was obstinately contested by the Austrian commander, the
Archduke Charles. In the neighborhood of the Austrian capital there
were desperate engagements at Aspern and Essling (May 21-22). For a
time Napoleon’s lieutenants, Masséna and Lannes, were hard pressed
near the island of Lobau in the Danube. The French advance was checked
thirteen times; Essling was taken and retaken, and, according to
general opinion, the primary result of this serious contest was only a
repetition of Eylau.Reinforcements were summoned from all sides; Lobau was transformed
into a strong citadel with impregnable redoubts to insure the passage
of the river. In July, Napoleon had under him 150,000 men and 450
cannon. On the 5th and 6th of the month a decisive battle was fought
at Wagram, according to a carefully planned program. The Austrians
were first of all outnumbered; the whole French army was so dispersed
and concentrated over a distance of not more than four miles that it
could be directly under the Emperor’s eyes. On the other hand, the
Austrians were scattered, had no reserves at hand, and orders had to
be given in writing. Successful as was Napoleon’s strategy, which
contained his favorite expedient of breaking the enemy’s center by an
overwhelmingly strong concentrated attack on the weakest point, it was
plain to him that there was no longer in his army the cohesive action
that had made the earlier victories so complete. The battle cost from
20,000 to 25,000 men on each side. “These are no longer the soldiers
of Austerlitz,” he explained; and he showed his lack of confidence by
giving up bayonet charges and trusting to artillery fire to break up
his opponents’ lines.The Austrian archduke withdrew from the field in good order, but
Napoleon had no desire to pursue and force another engagement in the
interior of the country. He trusted to the general influence abroad of
the success at Wagram, and was glad to sign a treaty of peace at Vienna
on the 14th of October, 1809, by which Austria was denuded of large
sections of territory, that were taken to reward the fidelity of the
Bavarians and Poles to their French allies. Under this reorganization
Austria occupied a territory smaller than that of pre-revolutionary
France. She was required to reduce her army to 150,000 men and to
pay an indemnity of $17,000,000. Russia’s share of the spoil was
measured by her apathetic position as an ally. There was an addition
of territory containing a population of 400,000, but this was a small
gain that by no means outweighed the favor shown to the Poles by the
annexation of western Galicia to the grand duchy of Warsaw. Annexed to
the French Empire were Fiume, Trieste, Croatia, Carniola, and a part of
Carinthia, so that Napoleon’s eastern dominions extended practically
without a break in their eastern border from the mouth of the Cattaro
to Dantzic. Austria seemed to have become as much a satellite of
Napoleon’s empire as Holland or Italy.
VII THE BEGINNING OF THE END
During the course of the contest with Austria, the war in the Iberian
peninsula went on in a prolonged series of obstinate campaigns
between Napoleon’s marshals and an allied force composed of English,
Portuguese, and Spanish contingents. Even after the victory of Wagram
the Spaniards held on in the face of several disasters; and helped
by the English fleet they managed to retain a foothold in Cadiz. The
temper of the population was judged to be so hostile that the French
army of occupation was raised to the enormous number of 270,000 and
the whole country was placed under martial law. The King, Napoleon’s
brother Joseph, was only the nominal executive; he aptly called himself
the porter of the Madrid hospitals. As the country was harassed with
guerrilla warfare, and as the Cortes refused to recognize Joseph as
their sovereign, Napoleon threatened to annex the whole kingdom to
France.In Portugal, a French army under Masséna failed to win a decisive
victory. It was met by an Anglo-Portuguese force under Wellington, who
so strongly intrenched himself at Torres Vedras that Masséna finally
withdrew, followed by the English. In his retreat the French general
was unable to change his fortune, and the effort to occupy Portugal
failed. Masséna was then superseded in his command. Later on the French
cause was much injured by the mutual jealousies of the commanders of
the various army corps, who, if they had zealously coöperated, might,
with the superior forces at their command, have driven Wellington back
to the sea coast. By the year 1812, the French armies were stale,
and although there were 230,000 French soldiers in the peninsula,
Wellington was allowed to invade Spain with an army of only 60,000 men.Napoleon was indignant at the mismanagement of his subordinates,
and sent Jourdon to take charge of the military operations. The new
commander not only found the various generals under him unwilling to
act together, but also had to deal with a situation in which the troops
were demoralized by habits of pillage. Their pay was in arrears, field
artillery was scarce, the large siege guns had fallen into the hands of
the English, there were no wagon trains and no supply service. Napoleon
himself could not from a distance undertake any intelligent supervision
of the Spanish situation, since he was obliged to depend on indirect
information, and when he interfered his commands were rarely carried
out with common sense or good will. His own hands were not free when
the Spanish affairs became most critical, for the alliance with Russia,
on which so much hope was placed, proved only temporary. On both sides
there were grievances; Napoleon was indignant at the apathetic attitude
of his ally during the Wagram campaign, and he felt irritated also
at the hesitation and delay of the Czar in arranging a marriage for
him with a Russian archduchess, after the divorce from Josephine. A
distinct Austrian trend was given to French policy when Napoleon found
the Austrian Emperor willing to sacrifice his daughter, for the purpose
of perpetuating the Napoleonic dynasty. Intimation was given in plain
terms that in the questions relating to the Balkan peninsula, Russia’s
scheme of aggression would be no more encouraged nor supported.In Alexander’s domains the continental blockade against England was
unpopular and disastrous. With English vessels barred from Russian
ports there was no more an outlet for the raw materials of the country.
Many of the landlords were in a bankrupt condition; reprisals were made
by increasing the tariff on French goods. In a military sense the only
benefit accruing to Russia from the French alliance was the conquest of
Finland. No good came from French help either in the war with Persia
or in that with Turkey. On the other side, the constant extension
of French territory and influence placed a sinister but natural
interpretation on Napoleon’s promises to share with the Russians the
dominion of all European and Asiatic lands as far East as India.The last step in annexation illustrated the character of Napoleon’s
present temper. Hamburg and Lübeck were incorporated with the French
Empire and along with them the duchy of Oldenburg, whose duke was
closely allied to the Russian royal house. The Czar protested formally,
but without moving the Emperor of the French either to recede or to
give adequate compensation for annexing these German territories.But the severest blow to Russia came from the favors shown the Poles,
to reward their valorous coöperation in the Wagram campaign. The Czar,
who feared the restoration of the kingdom of Poland, attempted to
secure from Napoleon the promise that that kingdom should never be
reëstablished. Napoleon’s reply was that he would only pledge himself
not to give any assistance to any revolt tending to restore the kingdom
of Poland. The Czar’s anxiety was misplaced, for the provinces of his
empire that he feared might be taken, were in no sense Polish socially,
though they had formed a part of the ancient kingdom of Poland. There
was no likelihood of a popular movement in favor of the Poles, nor
would the population have endured a pro-Polish rearrangement of their
territory against the Russians, with whom they, as members of the
Orthodox Church, were closely in sympathy. There was also a pro-Russian
party among the Poles which Alexander encouraged, by proposing a scheme
to establish an enlarged autonomous Poland with a constitution under
Russian protection. In 1811, Russian troops were massed together, to
invade the grand duchy of Warsaw, and so to encourage the Russian
partisans to carry through Alexander’s scheme.In the spring of 1811, Napoleon, who had at first made light of the
intimations of the hostile purposes of the Czar, that kept coming to
him from Polish sources, realized that there was a substance behind
these reports and began to collect forces from all parts of his empire
to protect the grand duchy. Napoleon told the Russian representatives
of his gigantic preparations, and at the same time declared that he
wished for peace; he asked also whether Alexander thought he was ready
to sacrifice 200,000 Frenchmen to re-establish Poland.But the final rupture arose over Napoleon’s economic policy. Alexander
refused to give up the right of trading with neutrals. “I am ready,”
he said, “to withdraw to Siberia rather than accept for Russia the
situation now occupied by Austria and Prussia.” When the Russian
ultimatum was handed in, its conditions were the settlement of
Alexander’s grievances with Sweden, the evacuation of Prussia, and
the right of commerce with neutrals as preliminary to the question
of tariffs and indemnity for the seizure of Oldenburg. Napoleon’s
unwilling allies, Prussia and Austria, smarting as they were from past
defeats at his hands, were not to be depended upon. On the other hand,
Russia’s hands were made free by subsidies from England, by a treaty
of peace with Turkey, and by the valuable aid of Sweden, whose crown
prince was now Bernadotte, a kinsman of Napoleon and one of his ablest
marshals.In May, 1812, the French Emperor appeared in Dresden, ready to
undertake the invasion of Russia; he was the personal ruler of 130
French departments, and under him, in the relation of vassals, were
seven kingdoms and thirty princes. In Poland, he was greeted with great
enthusiasm, but the actual contingents supplied to his army from Polish
sources did not amount to more than 70,000 men. Much of the Grand Army
with which Russia was now invaded, 678,000 in all (among the items
being 480,000 foot, 100,000 horse, and 80,000 artillerymen), were
composed, to the proportion of nearly half, of foreign contingents.
Besides the force taken with him to Russia, he had at his command,
under arms, 150,000 soldiers in France, 50,000 in Italy, 300,000 in
Spain. The plan of campaign was to penetrate into the interior of
the Russian Empire, leaving ample forces to guard communications and
protect the flanks, as the French advanced. On the Russian side the
forces were much less numerous, and there actually faced the 400,000
French who crossed the Niemen the last of June, only 147,000 Russians.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'Napoleon’s plan depended for success on quick action. He hoped to
attack and overcome the two chief Russian armies, before they had
effected a junction. But the country was not like the plains of central
Europe; it was marshy and broken by forests. His commanders, especially
his brother Jerome, whose position at the head of an army corps was
an absurd concession to the clan spirit of the Bonaparte family,
showed dilatoriness in executing important strategical movements. The
troops also suffered in their discipline from the constant marauding
expeditions. Desertions were numerous, many lagged behind, and there
were epidemics in the invading army owing to the extreme heat. From
these various causes the divisions lost a large percentage of their
effective strength, so that by the middle of July the invaders were
faced by a reduction in the original number of their army of 150,000
men. Napoleon won no decisive victory, for after every engagement the
enemy contrived to get away, drawing the invading forces farther into
the interior of the country.At Smolensk and Borodino there were battles that recalled the Eylau
campaign, the losses were heavy on both sides without producing any
change in the position of the opposing armies. On September 7, a
murderous battle took place at Borodino near Moscow; the victory for
the French might have been complete, if Napoleon had not at a critical
time refused to let his guard charge, saying that he did not want to
destroy it, 800 leagues away from France. The loss on both sides was
frightful; of the French 30,000 were “hors de combat,” while the
Russians counted their losses at 60,000. Among the killed on the French
side were three generals of division, nine brigadier generals, and ten
colonels. The Russians lost their heroic commander Bagration.The road was now opened to Moscow, but there was no rejoicing among
the victors, for on the field of battle lay 30,000 dead and 60,000
wounded. On the 14th, Napoleon entered the city, the ancient capital
of Russia. Most of the inhabitants had fled, leaving only the lower
classes and the occupants of the prisons, whom the governor of the city
had released, when he heard of the victory of the French. While the
army was halted in expectation that Alexander would sue for peace, a
fire, started by Russian incendiaries, soon consumed most of the city,
the houses of which were constructed entirely of wood. Fifteen thousand
of the Russian wounded, who had been brought on in ambulances, were
burnt to death. After the fire had spent its course Napoleon took up
his abode in the Kremlin, which was only saved by the efforts of the
Imperial Guard. He still hoped that terms of peace might be arranged,
but Alexander continued inflexible.Napoleon for a time contemplated spending the winter in Russia, since
he recognized the practical difficulties of the retreat and the loss
of prestige due to his withdrawal. Finally he decided to return by the
southern provinces. The start west began on the 19th of November, 1812,
with a force of 100,000 men; the way south was made impracticable by
the obstinate resistance of the Russian general Kutusoff, with his army
of only 50,000 men. Therefore the route over which they had come had
to be taken for the return. The rearguard was constantly harassed by
the enemy, and early in November there was a battle at Viazma, in which
the French lost from 15,000 to 18,000 men. Snow began to fall, food was
scarce, the troops were badly prepared to endure the wintry weather;
out of 100,000 men there were soon only 40,000 left able to bear arms,
and at Smolensk on the 12th of November only 34,000 were left.No French army corps actually surrendered, but they suffered terrible
losses, some of them losing half their effective strength. The Russians
who followed the retreat were also reduced from 60,000 to 30,000.
At the Berezina, where three Russian armies were joined to dispute
the passage, the French with unheard-of bravery rescued themselves
from capture by forces three times as numerous, and inflicted on the
Russians a loss of 14,000 men. When the remnants of the army reached
Lithuania, Napoleon left them there in order to make a rapid return to
Paris and to counteract by his presence in his capital the bad effect
of the news of the defeat in Russia. New armies had to be raised, for
it was practically certain that a large part of Germany would soon be
in revolt. Though temporarily strengthened by the various contingents
left to protect the communications eastward, the final stage of the
retreat from Russia, which was conducted by Murat, bore witness to
the frightful straits and demoralization of the French. The sick and
wounded were abandoned; there were no provisions for carrying the
artillery or the pontoons; even the army treasure and the secret
archives had to be left behind. Before the end of the journey west Ney,
who commanded the rearguard, had with him no more than 500 or 600 men,
and when the Old Guard entered Königsberg, it was reduced to 1500 men,
of whom only 500 were fit to bear arms.The extent of the Russian disaster may be measured by a few statistics;
533,000 soldiers crossed the actual frontier into Russia in the
summer of 1812; 18,000 of the main army returned in the December
following; about 130,000 men had been made prisoners in Russia,
55,000 had deserted at the opening of the campaign, and there were
55,000 survivors of the various corps that had been stationed as
reserves along the line outside of the Russian territory. Altogether
250,000 must be reckoned as having perished during the course of the
march to Moscow and the retreat from that city. The disaster meant
that Napoleon’s schemes of European domination were checked and his
military resources much diminished. It was no longer a question of new
conquests, but of turning to face the nations who had suffered so long
from French despotic rule.
VIII DEFEAT AND EXILE
From every quarter came the word that, with the Grand Army destroyed,
the French Cæsar must now yield; his system, it was said, had expired
on the plains of Russia. The hostile spirit of a subject population
was seen as the straggling French passed through Prussia; soldiers who
dropped out of the ranks were disarmed by the peasants, insulted and
badly handled. The Prussians and Austrians made separate arrangements
with the Russians, by which hostilities, so far as each were concerned,
were to be suspended. Most of Prussia was abandoned; there were only
40,000 French left to oppose a revolted Germany. Even Murat, Napoleon’s
brother-in-law, abandoned the failing cause and retired suddenly to
Naples, to make from there arrangements on his own account with the
Austrian Prime Minister Metternich.The activity of Napoleon in such a desperate situation was marvelous.
As to money, he collected nearly $100,000,000 by using his own private
treasury and selling large amounts of communal estates. Every available
man was placed under arms, including the National Guard and even by
anticipation the conscripts of 1814--there were already 140,000 of
the conscripts of 1813 under training--the sailors in the seaports
were enrolled as soldiers; and many regiments were taken from Spain.
Altogether there was collected and sent in detachments to Germany an
army of 500,000 men, mostly made up of youths less than twenty years
of age. In order to give them discipline and stability, veterans were
incorporated in the new regiments.Napoleon was not so alert as he had been; he was suffering from an
internal disease, and sometimes for weeks he was incapable of effort.
There were frequent attacks also of drowsiness, all indicative
of exhaustion of his powers. He was more intolerant than ever of
criticism, refused to take advice, was suspicious of his counselors,
and contemptuous of the ability of his commanders, an attitude somewhat
justified by the fact that many of his best marshals were now replaced
by men of second-rate ability, while others, who were fitted to
command, were unwilling from jealousy to work together. Marbot declared
that, “if the Emperor had wished to punish all those who were lacking
in zeal, he would have been obliged to dispense with the services of
nearly all his marshals.”The service of supplies for the army was most defective. In the
beginning of the year 1813, by the carelessness of the administrative
work in this department, the Prussians got possession of over
$6,000,000 worth of supplies, intended for the French armies. The
consequence was that the soldiers depended on pillage; even the
officers lived on what they could get from the country. Worse than
all was the inability of the Emperor himself to gauge the changed
conditions produced by his defeat. He still behaved as if he were
invincible, and refused to make terms with Prussia or to conciliate
Austria by well-timed territorial concessions. To the end he would not
believe that his father-in-law, the Emperor of Austria, would take up
arms against him. If, at this time, he had accepted a smaller, compact
France, confined to its natural limits, he might have avoided the
disasters of 1813 and 1814, and yet ruled over a territory larger than
that ever held by Louis XIV.In the new coalition Prussia was most anxious to restore her prestige;
the uprising against the French was a national movement common to all
classes of the population. Finally, even the timorous King was induced
to side with the Russians and to issue an appeal to his people. There
were 150,000 Prussians under arms, and in order to receive the help of
other German states, proclamations were issued under Russian auspices,
making generous promises of national independence and personal liberty.
So were transplanted to German soil the watchwords of the French
Revolution. Austria made many open professions of fidelity to the
alliance with France, but Metternich was actively intriguing with the
smaller German courts. He even tried to detach Jerome of Westphalia and
Murat of Naples from the French, and he did all in his power to urge
Frederick William, the Prussian king, to take up arms in behalf of the
independence of Europe.In the military operations of 1813, while the French were opposed only
by the allied forces of Prussia and Russia, the advantage continued
on the side of the French Emperor; by the autumn, however, Austria
and many of the German vassal states had joined the coalition and the
defeat of Napoleon was the certain outcome. As a result of a series
of battles around Dresden, the cause of the allies was in a critical
position; both sides had lost heavily but Napoleon was much chagrined
that there had been no signal positive advantage from the constant
butchery of his men. He was weak in cavalry, and so could not follow
up his successes; the terrible loss of horses in Russia had not been
made up. But at any rate he was steadily getting back the territory
in Germany he had previously held. On the other side, the Russian and
Prussian generals were blaming one another for their failures, and so
making the continuance of the coalition problematical.At this point Metternich intervened after an armistice had been signed
at Pressnitz early in July, 1813. He agreed to support the coalition,
unless the French consented to give up Holland, Switzerland, Spain,
the Confederation of the Rhine, Poland, and the larger part of Italy.
Napoleon was indignant when Metternich laid down these terms during a
personal interview at Dresden. “You want war,” he said; “well, you will
get it. I will meet you at Vienna. How many allies have you got, four,
five, six, twenty? The more you have the less disturbed I am. What do
you want me to do? Disgrace myself? Never. I can die, but I shall never
give up an inch of territory. Your sovereigns who are born on a throne
can let themselves be beaten twenty times, and always return to their
capital. I cannot do it, because I am an upstart soldier. You are not
a soldier, and you do not know what takes place in a soldier’s soul.
I grew up on battlefields, and a man such as I am cares little for the
lives of a million men.”When a congress met at Prague to arrange the terms of peace, they
proved far more favorable to France than those first proposed, for
she was granted her natural frontiers and Italy in addition. It was
nothing short of madness on Napoleon’s part to refuse such concessions;
only a portion of them had even been dreamed of as possibilities under
the Bourbon monarchs at the height of their ambition. Even from his
own point of view, he might have trusted to the certainty of future
jealousies between the central European powers and Russia, by which his
place as the arbiter of Europe could be regained. Metternich, indeed,
was as insincere in his profession on behalf of peace as Napoleon
himself, because the congress closed before a special messenger with
the French counter proposals reached Vienna. War was resumed on August
11th.The situation was now as follows: the French were about to be
surrounded by three great armies; 130,000 Austrians, 240,000 Russians,
and a mixed host, composed of various contingents from all the allies
great and small, under the former French marshal, Bernadotte, numbering
180,000 men. Moreover, there were 200,000 combined English and Spanish
soldiers ready to cross the Pyrenees. Altogether 1,000,000 men were
ranged in arms against the French Emperor. The plan as developed by
Bernadotte, now King of Sweden, was to wear Napoleon out. A decisive
battle would be avoided, but his lieutenants would be destroyed in
detail. Moreau, the victor of Hohenlinden, was brought from the United
States, where he had been living in exile, to assume the command of the
allies.To oppose the vast allied forces, Napoleon had altogether no more
than 550,000 men, of whom 330,000 were in Germany. At Dresden, at the
end of August, an attack on the place was successfully resisted, and
Moreau, the generalissimo of the allies, lost his life. But Napoleon’s
scattered marshals fared badly, and the French army suffered heavy
losses just at a time when no man could be spared. The enveloping
plan was successfully carried out. Napoleon, at Leipzig, realized
his hopeless position, for he tried there to arrange an armistice.
With his 155,000 men he had against him 330,000 of the coalition. The
situation was rendered worse because the German troops serving with the
French deserted and joined the enemy; some, like the Saxons, during the
very course of the terrible battle which raged for three days around
Leipzig (October, 1813). At the end, 15 French generals and 25,000 men
were made prisoners, and 350 cannon were taken; 13,000 of the French
were massacred in the houses of Leipzig. The losses on both sides were
frightful, for 130,000 was the sum total of the killed and wounded,
50,000 of whom were French.In the retreat which followed, the demoralization was so great that
only 40,000 men reached the Rhine, yet nearly 200,000 men were left,
by Napoleon’s orders, in various German fortresses, most of them, too,
experienced troops who were unable to take further part in the war when
their country was invaded in the next year’s campaign. Some attempt
was made to arrange terms of peace now that everywhere the Napoleonic
system had fallen to pieces. The French armies were driven out of
Holland. In Italy alone Eugène Beauharnais was manfully and loyally
supporting the Emperor’s cause, but he had only 30,000 men.The people of France had no heart for more warfare, and the allies
let it be known that they were fighting Napoleon and not France. But
still the great mass of the people had no wish for a change of dynasty;
the war was unpopular, but not its author. As soon as it became known
that the cause of the allies meant a restoration of the Bourbons,
and that France would be invaded, in order to displace Napoleon, the
answer of the country, exhausted though it was and drained of its male
population, was spontaneous and unmistakable. From the autumn of 1813,
to March, 1814, France placed in the field under Napoleon’s orders,
350,000 men. This is a marvelous record, not to mention the tremendous
financial drain caused by the equipment of a fresh army.The new recruits were not trained, well armed, or sufficiently
clothed; there was not time to prepare them for warfare, for the allies
crossed the frontiers of France in midwinter (1813). There was no
resistance to their progress until Napoleon with an army of 122,000
began to conduct his last extended campaign in the neighborhood of
Châlons. By reason of a success gained near Rotheise the allies hoped
soon to be in Paris. This over-confidence exposed them to a series of
defeats, inflicted upon several of their generals in succession, by
Napoleon, in a remarkable exposition of his strategy that recalled the
early days of his career in Italy. By the end of February the principal
army of the allies retired near Troyes, afraid, though numbering
150,000 men, to face a stand-up fight with Napoleon, who had only
70,000 men. Public confidence was restored in France, especially among
the country people, indignant at the brutal treatment they received at
the hands of the foreign soldiers. There was now stirred up a spirit
of national resistance, which recalled the early days of the French
Revolution. The peasantry arose, and inflicted severe losses on the
marauding troops. Attempts were made in the spring to arrange terms
of peace, but on neither side was there a sincere belief that the war
could be brought to an end by mutual concessions. The Congress of
Châtillon lasted from the 4th of February to the 19th of March; it was
only a concession to public opinion, for the allies really wished for a
Bourbon restoration, while Napoleon, depending on his marriage with the
daughter of Francis I of Austria, felt certain that he could ultimately
detach the Austrians from the coalition. At one time the allied armies
were so discouraged, after fighting ten battles on French soil, that
they contemplated a retreat eastward.Confidence was restored to them, not by their military successes, but
by the capture of some private despatches from various officials to the
French Emperor, which spoke in no uncertain terms of the discontent of
the people of Paris and of the general depression throughout a country
that was no longer able to bear the material exhaustion caused by the
war. So encouraged, the allies marched to Paris; Napoleon anticipated
this step, and had ordered the government to withdraw towards the
Loire, feeling sure that in time he could drive his foes from French
territory. Yet he realized to the full the bad effect of the seizure of
his capital.In approaching the city the allies had only to deal with the marshals,
not with the master hand of the Emperor, who first heard of their march
westward three days after it had begun. The end soon came; there was a
murderous engagement near the city, after which the arrangements for an
armistice were made with Joseph Bonaparte, acting for the regent, the
Empress Marie Louise. When Napoleon heard the news of the capitulation,
he indignantly prepared to annul the action of his brother, and to
call the people to arms for a hand-to-hand struggle in the streets of
Paris with the foreign soldiery. In a few days, owing to the shrewd
persuasions of Talleyrand, who induced Alexander of Russia to accept
no alternative government for the country but a Bourbon restoration,
Napoleon found himself forced to abdicate.This step was not taken until after long hesitations, for even to the
last he believed in the possibility of continuing hostilities. The
troops were still enthusiastically loyal, and eagerly listened to his
appeal to them to march upon Paris. But his marshals insisted that he
must abdicate. This he finally did in a conditional form, reserving
the rights of Napoleon II, and the regency of Marie Louise. This form,
owing to the refusal of the Czar to accept it, was finally altered
until it read as follows: “The allied powers having proclaimed that
the Emperor Napoleon was the sole obstacle to the restoration of peace
in Europe, the Emperor Napoleon, loyal to his oaths, declares that he
renounces in behalf of himself and his heirs the thrones of France and
Italy, because there is no personal sacrifice, even to the extent of
his life, that he is not ready to make in the interest of France.”...For several days after abdicating, Napoleon remained in Fontainebleau
practically deserted by his old comrades in arms, who were anxious
to make peace with the new government, now that Louis XVIII had been
proclaimed king. On the night of the 12th of April he tried to poison
himself, but the attempt failed, for the toxic drug, which he had
always carried on his person since the retreat from Moscow, had lost
its power. He soon recovered, however, from his depression, and on the
20th of April, 1814, signed the treaty of Fontainebleau, by which he
was given the sovereignty of the island of Elba, and retained the title
of Emperor.The story of the Spanish campaign, which had a potent influence in
causing Napoleon’s ruin, is marked by many brilliant feats of arms
on the part of the French, but the country could no longer be held.
Finally, by the successful advance of Wellington, the Spanish war
became merged in the general defense of French territory, when France
was invaded by the coalition in 1814. On Spanish soil the final
disaster came at the battle of Vitoria, June 21, 1813, where the
French lost 7000 men, 180 pieces of artillery, and nearly all their
baggage trains. One of the great mistakes of the Peninsular War was
Soult’s refusal to give battle to Wellington in 1812, when all the
advantages in numbers were on his side. Later on, though he was in a
far inferior position, he proved a most obstinate opponent, contesting
Wellington’s march north at every step with an army inferior to that
under his opponent. He gave way slowly, and while Napoleon was fighting
the allies in his last campaign before his abdication, Soult had
been forced to withdraw from Bayonne, and then from Toulouse, which
Wellington entered on the 12th of April, 1814.It is generally held by critics that the war in Spain was a most
serious mistake from start to finish, and was the chief cause of
Napoleon’s ruin. Whatever share in the failure of the imperial policy
in the Peninsula may be assigned to the mediocre capacity of Joseph and
to the confused strategy of the French armies due to the jealousies of
the marshals, a large part of the responsibility falls to the account
of Napoleon himself. He left his work half done in the Peninsula, where
he underrated the difficulties of conquest. He reckoned that it would
cost him but 12,000 men! As a matter of fact, it kept a large number
of his best troops occupied at a time when they were most needed. It
was sheer folly to undertake the Russian campaign while Spain was still
far from being pacified. It was also culpably bad tactics to allow
Wellington to destroy the prestige of French soldiers and generals,
and it was close to madness, in 1813, not to withdraw altogether from
Spain, when every man was needed in France to defend its frontiers from
the coalition. On the other hand, while Spain’s resistance to French
arms was a glorious record of patriotism, modern Spain has paid very
dear for its glory. All the elements of reaction were interested in
the downfall of the Napoleonic régime, and in no other country, not
even Italy, did the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty produce such
deplorable maladministration and civil disorder.The dramatic farewell of the Emperor to his troops at Fontainebleau
makes a picturesque “mise-en-scène” for the close of a tragedy; it is
unfortunate that the spectacular instincts of his genius induced him
to accept the ridiculous rôle of sovereign of the island of Elba. It
would have been more dignified for him to have refused the offer of the
allies, and to have exchanged the rôle of a “roi fainéant” for that of
a private individual. Nothing illustrates the parvenu traits of his
character more than his desire to preserve the shadow of the royal
dignity, even if he had to accept bounty from the hands of a Bourbon
king to maintain it.The allies fully realized the danger of his proximity in Elba, and
unofficially there were various plans discussed with a view to rid
themselves of their dangerous neighbor. Talleyrand was plotting to have
him imprisoned, while the English urged deportation to an inaccessible
island. Napoleon, who was an admirable actor, accommodated himself to
his Lilliputian kingdom and to his mimic court, and adopted the pose
of a modern Timoleon. “I wish to live henceforth,” he said, “like a
justice of the peace. The Emperor is dead, I am no longer anything. I
think of nothing outside of my small island. I exist no longer for the
world. Nothing now interests me but my family, my cottage, my cows, and
my mules.” His demands were not so modest as his words appear, for he
spent nearly 2,000,000 francs at Elba in eight months.He complained bitterly at being separated from his son and his wife,
both of whom Francis kept in Vienna. There was no intention that they
should be allowed to rejoin the Emperor; indeed, Marie Louise, who
was of a very passive disposition, was content not to see her husband
again, especially after Metternich had supplied her with an admirer,
General Neippberg. It might have been wiser, certainly it would have
been more humane, if the allies had adopted a less stringent policy
of isolation. Whatever one may think of the sincerity of Napoleon’s
sentiments, he struck a true note, when he wrote the words “my son has
been taken from me, as were formerly the children of the vanquished, to
adorn the triumph of their conqueror. One cannot find in modern times
an example of such barbarity.” He was not entirely dejected, for he
was visited by his mother and his youngest sister, and though the king
of Rome was withheld from him, an irregular heir was brought to Elba
by the Countess Walinska, whom Napoleon had met some years before in
Poland.There were financial embarrassments, which made impossible the idyllic
life the exiled monarch had mapped out for himself; the income
stipulated by the treaty of Fontainebleau was not paid. But there
were more weighty reasons for the flight from Elba, which occurred
early in 1815 (February 26). For some time Napoleon had been in secret
communication with Murat, probably with a view to restoring the kingdom
of Italy, through coöperation from Naples. This scheme promised more
difficulties than a return to France, where the Bourbon restoration
was not popular, and where the army and its generals were far from
being satisfied with their new situation, under a king who favored
the lifelong supporters of his cause. Plans had been concocted during
the winter to dethrone Louis XVIII, in which both the Bonapartist
sympathizers and some of the old revolutionary leaders had acted
together. On hearing of this, Napoleon considered that the moment
was opportune for his reappearance on French soil. With 1100 of his
veterans who had acted as his guard at Elba, he reached southern France
in safety. As the prevailing sentiment in this region was royalist, he
made his way with his small band through the Alps to Grenoble, marching
sometimes as much as thirty miles a day. By the peasants of the country
he was welcomed everywhere with enthusiasm. From Paris orders were sent
to treat him as an outlaw.The critical time came at Grenoble, when Napoleon’s dramatic qualities
helped him to secure the allegiance of his old troops. He marched
impressively at the head of his veterans to within gunshot distance
of a regiment drawn up in his way. “Soldiers,” he said, “look well at
me. If there is among you one soldier who wishes to kill his Emperor
he can do it. I come to offer myself for you to shoot.” The effect was
instantaneous, and the answer to his appeal was the old familiar cry,
“Long live the Emperor.”The enthusiasm increased as he proceeded farther north. Nothing
could arrest it or prevent the defection of the troops, not even the
appeals for loyalty to the Bourbon king, addressed to their men by the
marshals, who strove to outdo one another in their official abuse of
the enterprise. Soult spoke of Napoleon as an adventurer; others called
him a public enemy or a mad brigand, while Ney undertook to bring him
to Paris in an iron cage. The army cared nothing for these criticisms
or warnings; even Ney himself joined the movement and turned over his
troops to the “man from Elba.” By the 20th of March Napoleon was in
Paris at the Tuileries; his marvelous progress was a restoration, not
based on diplomacy, but made possible by the enthusiastic loyalty of
the population, and the rank and file of the army. Not a gun had been
fired. At Grenoble it had been the soldiers who had refused to obey
their officers’ command, when told to shoot. Afterwards there was no
officer found willing to repeat the command.The question of establishing a new government was solved by
inaugurating a liberal constitutional rule. Napoleon seemed once again
to remember that he was the creation of the Revolution. As an evidence
of his sincerity to the tradition of the Republic, he selected as
his chief adviser, Benjamin Constant, the old Jacobin leader, whose
independence a few years before Napoleon had so much resented when
Constant had led the opposition in the Tribunate. All these things
were now forgotten. “Public discussions, free elections, responsible
ministers, liberty of the press; I want all this. I am a man of the
people! If the people want liberty, I am bound to give it.” Under the
new government, which was accepted by a small vote, owing to the number
of those who stayed away from the polls, the elections returned a
majority of liberals and republicans, who were not in sympathy with the
restored empire. Many preferred to have a regency with Napoleon’s son
or the Duke of Orléans. But the real hopelessness of the situation came
from the implacable attitude of the allies. At the Congress of Vienna,
where the great powers were rearranging the map of Europe amidst much
jealousy and intrigue, they at least agreed on one subject: the refusal
to allow Napoleon to rule France. That devoted country was put under an
interdict. The four powers agreed to fight the French Emperor with a
coalition army of more than 1,000,000 men. To oppose this immense force
Davout, acting under Napoleon’s directions, had in a few weeks got
together for the purpose of national defense 500,000 men to be ready by
the end of June. Elaborate plans were made to protect the frontiers,
and Napoleon proposed to take the offensive without waiting for the
allies to invade the country.The nearest allied army was in Belgium, composed of 100,000 English
and Dutch under Wellington, and 150,000 Prussians under Blücher.
Napoleon set out to oppose these forces with 180,000 men, intending to
get between the English and the Prussians and beat them separately,
trusting to the well-known rapidity of his movements to keep them
from joining. Strategically the plan was a brilliant one, but it was
not capably executed. Ney, at Quatre Bras, did not win a complete
victory over the English because the engagement was begun too late. At
Ligny, Napoleon attacked Blücher, who fought obstinately, though he
lost 20,000 men, and was not completely crushed as had been planned.
Instead of withdrawing in confusion, as had been expected, Blücher
set out to join Wellington’s troops. Grouchy, who was sent in pursuit
of the Prussians, did not know of this operation and was under the
impression that he was carrying out properly his instructions to
pursue the Prussians alone, whereas the greater part of the Prussian
army had already come in touch with Wellington, and Grouchy failed,
therefore, to bring his men back in time to Waterloo where they were
needed. Wellington was strongly intrenched and all attempts to take his
position failed. The battle, begun at 11 A.M. on June 18, 1815, was not
decided until five o’clock, when Blücher effected his junction with
the English forces. It was a most desperate engagement, for Napoleon
realized what depended on it. The losses were 32,000 French and 22,000
of the allies.A second act of abdication was now imposed upon Napoleon, who accepted
it, resigning in favor of his son. He even offered to serve as a simple
general to prevent the allies from capturing Paris. This was not an
absolutely chimerical proposal, for there was an enormous mass of men
gathered by Davout, ready to fight even after the defeat of Waterloo.
But the elected representatives would not hear of continuing the
struggle. Napoleon lingered for several days near Paris, at Malmaison,
and it was only when he was advised by the temporary government
that they could not be responsible for his personal safety, that he
traveled towards the west, where his friends were arranging that he
should be taken on an American vessel to the United States. The sea
coast was watched by British cruisers, so the defeated conqueror
decided to surrender himself to the British, intending to claim their
hospitality and protection as a guest, not as a prisoner. Apparently,
Napoleon rejected the plan to cross the Atlantic “incognito,” for
the more spectacular one of throwing himself on the mercy of his
most bitter antagonists, because he counted on finding a protection
under the constitutional régime of Great Britain, and especially
on the ability of the liberal opposition to prevent him from being
treated with exceptional harshness. He realized, too, that it would
be most dangerous for him to fall into the hands of any of the allied
Continental Powers, who might have had him condemned to death by a
court-martial or immured in close confinement. It is known that the
British premier, Castlereagh, hoped that Napoleon would fall into the
hands of Louis XVIII and be treated as a rebel. Therefore, when the
vessel which carried him reached the English coast, there was some
hesitation as to the treatment he would receive.Finally, at the end of July, the problem was solved by arranging to
send the prisoner to the Island of St. Helena, because, on account of
its isolation, there would be little chance of escape. The climate was
healthy, close confinement would not be necessary, and Napoleon was
permitted to take a suite of servants and friends with him. During his
residence at Elba, the plan of a removal of the Emperor to St. Helena
had been discussed by the Powers at the Congress of Vienna; perhaps
the knowledge of this fact may have contributed largely to induce the
flight from Elba and the short-lived attempt to restore the empire.');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'Acting under international agreement, England became responsible for
the guardianship of Napoleon, who was called the prisoner of the
Powers. In October, 1815, began the captivity at St. Helena. It was
naturally a trying experience to a man who had lately played so great a
rôle in the world, and Napoleon did not have the temperament to endure
so conspicuous a change in fortune. He instantly began a campaign to
secure his release from captivity. Reckoning on the action of public
opinion in England working in his behalf, he left nothing undone to
exaggerate the onerous conditions under which he lived as an exile. On
its side, the British government, which was being administered by men
who represented a selfish oligarchy, and who had to their credit a long
record of inefficiency, corruption, and attacks on popular rights, was
not likely to show especial consideration to a fallen antagonist at St.
Helena. A regular system of persecution, inane and petty, was invented,
and in applying it the governor of the island, Sir Hudson Lowe, a man
of morose temper, whose character is admirably indicated by his name,
showed himself a master.There were various plans for aiding an escape, many of them originating
in the United States. Even an attack on St. Helena was discussed by
Napoleon’s followers, some of whom were on the American continent as
participants in the Brazilian war of independence against Portugal.
But Napoleon refused to consider any such methods of relief. “I could
not be in America six months,” he said, “without being attacked by
the murderers, whom the royalist committees, that returned to France
in the train of the Count d’Artois, have hired against me. In America
I see nothing but murder and oblivion, so I prefer to stay on at St.
Helena.” He saw truly that, in a life of freedom on the other side of
the Atlantic, there would be little chance of posing as the victim of
misfortune and maltreatment, and it was on the maintenance of this
pose that he built his hope of relief from captivity, perhaps even
of a return to his old place as ruler of France, for he counted on
the expulsion of the Bourbons and a reaction of popular feeling in
his behalf. A change of ministry in England also he looked forward to
as the opening of an avenue of escape to Europe. He refused to take
exercise because, in his walks, according to regulations, he had to
be accompanied by an English officer; therefore, he blamed his bad
health on the British government. Care was taken by publications in
London to detail at length the sufferings of the captive. Incessant
complaints were made of the trying climate of the island, the aim being
to represent the banishment to St. Helena as nothing but a plan to get
rid of Napoleon by the toxic effects of a tropical atmosphere. Indeed,
the bad climate of St. Helena has become an inseparable part of the
Napoleonic legend, yet we know that Napoleon said to members of his own
suite, that if he had to live an exile, St. Helena was, after all, the
best spot.As the years passed, nothing was changed, for the Whigs in England were
not strong enough to get any measures though Parliament favorable to
Napoleon, and in 1818 the five Great Powers issued a signed statement
that they approved of the strict treatment of the prisoner by the
British government, and resolved that all correspondence with Napoleon,
such as sending money or other communications, which was not submitted
to the inspection of the governor, must be regarded as an attack on the
public safety and punished accordingly.Under the régime of no exercise imposed upon himself by Napoleon, his
health became impaired; his manner of life accentuated the symptoms
of a disease, cancer of the stomach, which had appeared long before
the period of his exile. It was an inherited malady, for his father
had died of it, also his eldest sister. Some relief was secured by his
adopting a more active life in 1819; but with the beginning of the year
1821, the progress of the disease was rapid; exercise was no longer
possible, and even occasional dictation was found to be an exhausting
task. In April the condition of the prisoner was evidently hopeless,
and after he was assured on this point by a surgeon of the British
army, Napoleon dictated his testament to Montholon, one of his faithful
companions. After his death, which took place on May 5, 1821, the body
of the great captain was buried not far from Longwood, his residence.
Nearly a generation elapsed before it was carried to its present
resting place beneath the dome of the Invalides at Paris.
IX THE NAPOLEONIC REGIME
During the captivity at St. Helena much attention was given by Napoleon
to the dictation of his memoirs. These, however, cover only a short
portion of his career and are confessedly apologetic in character. They
are shrewdly constructed, often with a gross disregard of accuracy, in
order to influence public opinion in his favor. In his conversations
also he made good use of his interlocutors, to build up that legend of
Napoleonic infallibility and good faith that soon found a receptive
atmosphere in the prevalent romanticism of European society. He was
convinced to the end of his life that Bourbon rule in France could not
last, and he looked forward to a time when his son would be restored.
In summing up his own career, he claimed that his dictatorship was
a necessity. “Should I be accused of having loved war too much, the
historian will demonstrate that I was never the aggressor. Should I be
censured for desiring universal empire for myself, he will show that
that was the product of circumstances, and how my enemies drove me to
it, step by step.”In many passages in the same strain Napoleon curiously manifests his
adhesion to the principles and phrases of the idealogues, on whom as
a ruler he heaped so much scorn. It may be doubted whether the base
metal of his rhetoric would have become current, if the Powers who
participated in the Congress of Vienna had not introduced as their
maxims of political morality the inflated and transparently insincere
professions of the Holy Alliance. Indeed, from the beginning to the end
of the Napoleonic period, the point of view that the coalitions against
him were fighting in behalf of nationalism and liberty is little short
of absurd. At almost any time France under Napoleon might have arranged
an alliance with England by offering her the bait of commercial
concessions; and even more unsubstantial than the Napoleonic legend
is its antithesis, that the Tory oligarchy of England were spending
hundreds of millions of pounds of their good money for the benefit of
the peoples and states on the Continent.Napoleon’s inferiority cannot be discovered in his lack of morality as
a ruler, if morality be determined according to the standards of the
allied Powers; his chief opponents were trained and acted according to
the principles adopted in the partition of Poland. His lack of scruples
carried him farther, simply because of the immeasurable distance
between his own genius and the commonplace characteristics of any of
his antagonists. He built up his personal rule on his military skill
by consistent and well-directed effort. France was made the instrument
of his ambition; it was in his interest, not in the interest of the
country he ruled, that Germany, Italy, and Spain were made dependent
states. France would have been more solidly established, if, in spite
of all military success abroad, her ruler had been satisfied with her
natural frontiers.Under Napoleon the divorce of national from personal aims is seen
in the changed character of the French army; there was no longer a
general levy as in the time of the Revolution, for in 1800-1804,
service was regulated by lot and by permission to provide substitutes.
Middle-class families as a rule took advantage of this permission, and
there were plenty of opportunities, because old soldiers were anxious
to re-engage for the service. War had become a profession. The mass of
the troops were made up of children of the people, while the officers
were mostly scions of well-to-do families. As time went on, owing to
the exhausting character of the wars, one year’s conscription was not
enough. Sometimes there was an anticipated enrollment of the conscripts
of the two following years. Then came the turn of the National Guard,
made up of men from forty to sixty years, and of those from twenty to
twenty-six who had been relieved from regular army service, because of
their poor physique or because their families were dependent on their
work; these, too, were placed on the active list.Altogether 3,153,000 French soldiers were called upon for military duty
from 1800 to 1815. The losses from wounds and disease, apart from the
fatalities on the battlefield, were enormous. In all, the victims of
these wars are reckoned at 1,750,000 men. Oftentimes, those who desired
to escape military duty had to buy themselves off as many as three
times, and yet, even after spending $4000, they were obliged to take
part in the campaigns of 1813 and 1814. Finally, owing to the scarcity
of officers, requisition by force was resorted to. Lists were made of
special families in Paris and the departments, whose children between
the ages of sixteen and eighteen were constrained to prepare themselves
for service at the military school at St. Cyr.In the complicated system of the Napoleonic army, a place had to be
made for the various national elements and groups, who served in it.
But the characteristic feature was the Imperial Guard. In itself it was
a replica on a small scale of the whole force, because the various arms
of the service all found a place within it. It grew out of the consular
guard, first numbering 7000 men, then increased to 50,000, until it
was finally brought to 92,000 in 1813. The Guard was always with the
Emperor in a campaign, it fought under his eye, and was ordinarily
kept in reserve for a critical point of the battle. The section of
the Guard which was closest to the Emperor, was the mounted scouts or
“guides,” who wore a green uniform, the imperial color, and were first
commanded by his son-in-law, Eugène, and then by another member of the
Beauharnais house, Lefebre-Desnouettes. Napoleon described them as a
body of brave men who had always seen the enemies’ cavalry flee before
them. A part of this division was a corp of Mamelouks, recruited in the
Eastern campaign, from the Coptic and Syrian volunteers, a picturesque
body of men that still continued to wear Oriental dress, though later
on many Frenchmen were added to their number.In the infantry divisions of the army little change was made; there
were grenadier regiments composed of the tallest and best proportioned
soldiers, and companies of slight, undersized men intended for the
kind of work done in the present Italian army by the bersaglieri.
Experiments with dismounted dragoons proved a failure. Napoleon’s
special work was the reorganization of the cavalry, an arm of the
service which had almost altogether disappeared at the time of the
Revolution, because large numbers of the cavalry officers went into
exile on account of their monarchical sympathies. The most conspicuous
branch of the cavalry was the hussars, who gained a reputation for
dare-devil bravery, and whose charges with drawn sabers were the
dramatic feature of an engagement. They were led by generals of the
type of Murat, Marbot, and Ségur.As to the French artillery and engineers, their already high reputation
among European armies was fully maintained. In many of Napoleon’s
hardest contested battles, such as Eylau, Friedland, and Wagram,
the cannonading of the French played a decisive part. In the later
campaigns troops of the allied states came to be a more important
element, and they gave the army a cosmopolitan character. There were
German, Swiss, Italian, Spanish, Polish auxiliaries; even Albanians,
Greeks, and Tartars were represented in the enormous masses of men
drawn about the Emperor, in his final efforts to subjugate the European
continent.The weapons used by the army showed no technical advance on those
employed in the last half of the eighteenth century. The guns were
flint-locks of the model of 1777, and the cannon were of the type
employed in 1765, most of them pieces of 12 and 6 with mortars that had
a carrying power of between 800 and 1900 feet.Owing to the years of incessant warfare, the administration of the army
was the chief care of the government. It was under the supervision of
the Emperor himself, who was untiring in attending even to the most
minute details. He made frequent inspections, kept in personal touch
with his soldiers, and looked out for their comfort. In preparing for
a campaign he knew with accuracy all matters relating to the equipment
of his troops, the actual resources of the arsenals, and the amount
of military stores. But the army in the field was expected to provide
its own rations. “I made eight campaigns under the empire,” De Brack
said, “and always at the front; I never saw during this whole time a
single army commissary. I never touched a single ration from the army
stores. The soldiers depended on requisitions from the inhabitants or
on pillage.”It was the Emperor’s maxim that war must support war. When in Spain he
wrote to Dijeon, the administrative director of war in Paris: “Send
back the reserves of cattle; I don’t want any foodstuffs, I have an
abundance of everything. What I need are caissons, military transports,
hats, and shoes; I have never seen a cavalry in which the troops had
as much to eat.” The requisitions that had been found so profitable in
the Italian campaign were continued without any regard for their effect
on the conquered country. Enormous stores of money were accumulated
in this way. After the treaty of Tilsit the treasury of the army was
credited with about $70,000,000, and Napoleon reckoned that he could
continue to make war for five years without increasing French taxation
or asking for a fresh loan.As companions in arms Napoleon had under him a large number of able
generals, formed just as he had been, in the wars of the Revolution.
When the empire was constituted many became marshals. These were
selected from all classes of society: Davout, MacDonald, Marmont,
Grouchy, Clarke, from the old nobility; Monery, Bernadotte, Soult,
Mortier, Gouvion, Suchet, Brun-Junot, from the middle classes; Jourdan,
Masséna, Augereau, Murat, Bessières, Ney, Lannes, Victor, Oudinot,
Lecourbe, Sebastian, Driant were all children of the people. It was
the policy of the Emperor to have young men in command of his troops;
by 1813 there were forty-one cavalry generals alone, who, though
less than fifty years old, were on the retired list. The life of an
officer was so strenuous that there was little chance of resisting
for long the tremendous demands made on the constitution by the long
marches and frequent battles. Advancement was speedy and the rewards
were munificent; many of the marshals received princely titles with
pay suitable to their rank. For example, Berthier’s annual income was
over $250,000. Masséna, Davout, and Ney were almost as well provided
for. After the battle of Eylau each guest at the Emperor’s table found
under his plate a 1000-franc bill. But these personal rewards were not
at all confined to those in high command. The Emperor was careful to
retain the devoted loyalty of his men by words and acts of personal
note, which by their spontaneity kept the army from being turned into
a mere mechanical organism. He went among the men, rewarding those
who had distinguished themselves on the field of battle, and showing
consideration to the wounded and the weary. The weak spot in the
army was the practice of pillage. The soldiers were forced to it and
regarded it as their right. Their exactions, too, were imitated on
a large scale by the commanders and marshals. Masséna made millions
by selling trade permits during the blockade against England. Soult
despoiled Spain of works of art and exacted large contributions from
rich monasteries.In his economic policy, Napoleon followed the principles of the Bourbon
princes; he was a thorough-going disciple of the mercantilist school.
It was his purpose to ruin England; hence the severest enactments were
promulgated against colonial products and cotton, both prime articles
of English trade. Vessels touching English ports were excluded; not
only were high duties imposed on coffee, sugar, and cocoa, but cotton
fabrics were entirely prohibited. In 1806, when the English government
declared all the French ports from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe
closed, and subjected neutral vessels to search, Napoleon issued
the decree of Berlin by which the British Isles were declared to be
blockaded. All commerce with England was prohibited and no ship which
touched the English shores was admitted to a French port. Then came
from London the so-called Orders in Council by which neutral ships were
required to go to London, Malta, and other places subject to England,
to have their cargoes examined and to get permits to trade which had
to be paid for at high rates. The next stage in this economic war was
Napoleon’s decree of Milan, 1807 (December 7), which declared that
every ship which had been visited by English officials or had touched
at an English port should lose its nationality and be regarded as a
lawful prize.These drastic measures were never rigidly applied, for there grew up
a system of exemption by special permits excepting certain articles.
Smuggling, practised on a large scale, acted also as an ameliorating
factor; indeed, after 1810 colonial products were admitted into France,
though at a high rate of duty, but the war against cotton continued.
Everywhere it was found, it was seized, and confiscated or burnt.
The result of this system for France was worse than for England, for
by her mastery of the sea the latter power was able to maintain both
her industries and her credit, while France had to pay more for raw
products and, the export of her goods being hampered, the price in
the home market was artificially lowered. In 1802, foreign commerce
reached a sum total of 790,000,000 francs, of which exports accounted
for 325,000,000; ten years later the figures were 640,000,000 and
383,000,000, respectively.In finance the Napoleonic régime showed no disposition to make
innovations; only in details was the fiscal system altered. There
was no regular budget in the modern sense of the term; the accounts
for each year were kept open, and in order to make the yearly
balance, the resources of other years were drawn upon. Apart from
these financial irregularities, which, in the absence of any real
legislative representative system, were not criticised or counted, the
administration of the finances of the empire was carefully directed.
The officials were required to do their work well; there was no red
tape, and full value was received for every franc expended. Napoleon
was vigilant in defending the interests of the treasury, and he treated
it as his own patrimony.In no phase do his gifts as a ruler shine more conspicuously than in
his refusal to increase the public debt to any considerable extent. At
the fall of the Directory there were 46,000,000 francs of Rentes in
French government bonds; his government added only 17,000,000 to this
amount. He did not trust to credit to carry on his wars, the bankruptcy
of the Revolution being too fresh in the minds of French bondholders.
We have noticed before how he expected the extraordinary expenses of
warfare to be supplied. His forethought in raising contributions,
hard as it was for the conquered countries, was a blessing to French
investors.This care for a sound financial position sustained confidence in
the Napoleonic régime, even when its master was engaged in the most
hazardous military adventures. In the autumn of 1799 government five
per cents. were quoted at seven francs. In 1800 the lowest quotation
was 17.37, the highest 44. Each year the rise continued until it
attained its extreme limit in May, 1808, when it marked 88.15 francs.
Then there was a gradual fall. In March, 1814, the quotation was 45
francs, a year later it had risen to 81.65. Napoleon gave as much and
as watchful attention to the maintenance of public credit as he did to
the details of army administration. At the beginning of the Consulate
he proceeded to restore public confidence by abolishing forced loans
and by introducing specie payments. His only questionable financial
operation was the employment of the money allotted to the sinking fund,
to sustain artificially, at critical periods, the price of government
securities, in order to deceive public opinion as to the importance of
French defeats.One of the first steps taken by Napoleon on his attainment of the
supreme executive power was to make peace with the Church. Under the
anti-religious legislation of the Revolution, in which most of the
clergy and bishops had been declared outlaws, the social order had
added to its other ills religious chaos. After the battle of Marengo
in 1800, Napoleon, in an address to the clergy of Milan, laid down
the following principles for his church policy: “No society can exist
without morality, and there can be no good morality without religion.
Religion alone gives the state a firm and stable support. A society
without religion is like a vessel without a compass; France, taught by
her misfortunes, has finally opened her eyes; she has recognized that
the Catholic religion is, as it were, an anchor, that alone can keep
her steady, in her time of stress.”He had no purpose, however, to allow the Church to secure for itself an
organization, that might appeal to the people, apart from or contrary
to the government. His ideal was an ecclesiastical machine which could
be controlled exactly as if it were a government department. Under
such assumptions a concordat was arranged with the Papacy, whose power
Napoleon respected. He ordered his agent at Rome, who conducted the
negotiations, to treat the Pope as if he had 200,000 men. For some time
the discussion dragged, because Pius VII refused to accept certain
reforms which seemed to threaten the independence of the hierarchy.
Finally, the terms were arranged under which the First Consul gained
his two chief points: the introduction of an entirely new episcopate
with a reduction of dioceses and the recognition of the alienation of
church property during the Revolution.Among the most important features of this instrument was the
declaration that the Catholic religion should be freely exercised in
France, but that it was to conform itself to such police regulations
as the government should judge necessary for public tranquillity.
The new bishops were to be presented by the state and instituted by
the Pope. Parish priests were to be appointed by the bishops, but
the appointment could be vetoed by the state, and the payment of the
bishops and priests was undertaken by the government. A number of the
former constitutional bishops, who had been in schism with Rome, were
appointed in the new hierarchy which now numbered sixty members. The
introduction of the clause mentioned above relating to the police
powers of the state was used as a ground for a whole series of “organic
articles” by which the French Church was bound hand and foot to the
Napoleonic system; they were but a revival of the Gallican principles
adopted by Louis XIV to help him to become the supreme administrator
of the Church in France. Rome naturally protested, for these articles
interfered with the autocratic system of the Curia. Acts of the Holy
See and decrees of councils were not legalized in France unless they
were verified by the government. Bishops could not consult together
without a license from the government, or retire from their dioceses
temporarily, without a permit. In many other details episcopal
jurisdiction and church autonomy were interfered with. But all protests
were in vain, and Pius VII conformed reluctantly to the will of the
master of Western Europe, hoping that the slow-going diplomacy of his
Secretary of State, Consalvi, would secure future concessions.The first friction between the Emperor and the Pope occurred over the
introduction of religious orders. None were authorized except certain
orders for women, engaged in charitable or relief work. On December
2, 1804, after much hesitation, the Pope agreed to come to Paris to
participate in the imperial coronation. He was treated with respect,
but during the ceremony, when he was about to place the crown on
Napoleon’s head, the Emperor with a show of displeasure took it out of
his hands and crowned himself. On one ground or another Pius was kept
in France for several months, as Napoleon was glad to have the head of
the Church placed in a subordinate position before the world as a kind
of Grand Almoner to the Emperor of the French.New difficulties arose over the Pope’s refusal to annul the marriage of
Jerome Bonaparte with Miss Patterson, an American, who had been married
to Napoleon’s youngest brother in Baltimore in 1803 by the Roman
Catholic bishop of that city. There were fresh grounds of alienation
when, in 1806, Napoleon wrote to the Pope, who wished to be neutral,
to close his ports to English vessels and to expel from his court
English, Russians, and Swedes. “You are,” he said, “the sovereign of
Rome, but I am the Emperor; my enemies should be yours.” As the Pope
still proclaimed his neutrality, Napoleon seized the Papal States, and
finally occupied Rome in February, 1808. For fourteen months the Pope
was kept a virtual prisoner in the Quirinal under a guard of honor;
he was not allowed to communicate with the cardinals, twenty-four of
whom had been, by Napoleon’s orders, deported. Finally, in May, 1809,
a decree was issued by which the States of the Church were annexed to
the French Empire. Rome was proclaimed a free imperial city, the Pope
being allowed to keep only his palace and his estates with an income of
2,000,000 francs.Napoleon spoke of himself as revoking the Donation of Constantine; his
intention was to make of Paris the religious head of the world with
himself the director of its religion as well as of its secular affairs.
Pius VII’s reply was a bull of excommunication against the Emperor,
who, however, was not mentioned by name in the document. It only spoke
in general terms of those who were guilty of deeds of violence in the
States of the Church. Napoleon affected to pay little attention to the
Papal protest, but he acted promptly, first by appealing to the old
principle of the Gallican Church, that denied the right of the Pope to
excommunicate a sovereign of a state. Then he had the person of the
Pope seized by the commander of the Roman gendarmerie. No resistance
was offered, and Pius was conducted as a prisoner, in a closed carriage
with drawn shades, to Savona on the western Riviera near Genoa. Here
he was kept carefully guarded, but he refused all terms of settlement
that insisted on his surrender of the temporal power. No one was
allowed to see him except in the presence of his guards. When Napoleon
desired canonical institution for some newly appointed bishops, the
Pope refused, on the ground that he was deprived of the advice of his
cardinals. The situation was embarrassing, for there were, in August,
1809, twenty-seven vacant sees in France. Efforts were made to find
a solution by calling a council at Paris; but the ecclesiastics, on
assembling there, declared that the Pope’s consent was necessary.
Napoleon then ordered the bishops to take charge of their dioceses
without institution from the Pope. But a brief came from Savona to
Cardinal Maury, the archbishop designate of Paris, enjoining him from
administering his diocese without the Pope’s consent. The Emperor now
treated the prisoner of Savona with even more rigor, put in prison the
clergy whom he suspected of bringing the Papal brief, and deprived Pius
of all means of corresponding with the outside world.At this time the divorce of Napoleon from Josephine took place.
The difficulties of the civil law were got over easily, although
the Emperor had to violate the provisions of his own code, and the
ecclesiastical committee of the diocese of Paris showed itself equally
obliging, by recognizing the two imperial claims, that there had been
an absence of consent to his religious marriage of 1804, and that there
were defects of form in the ceremony itself. When the marriage with
the Austrian archduchess was celebrated on April 2, 1810, thirteen of
the twenty-six cardinals present in Paris refused to be present at
the religious ceremony. This behavior excited Napoleon to an act of
personal revenge, by which the recalcitrant princes of the Church were
deprived of the insignia of their office, were placed under police
supervision, and had to forego their allowance.In 1811, a council was held in Paris to decide on the question as
to the rights of the Pope in the matter of institution. Some of the
bishops showed independence, urging the Emperor to restore Pius
to liberty. There was a general agreement that Papal consent was
necessary. In the meantime the Pope had been cajoled or bullied into
accepting a clause, to be added to the Concordat, that canonical
institution should be given within a fixed period, and if it were not
given, it might be granted by the metropolitan or oldest bishop of
the province. Just before the invasion of Russia the aged Pope was
brought incognito from Savona to Fontainebleau. During the trip, though
he was seriously ill, no consideration was shown him, and for many
months after his arrival he was confined to his bed. Only cardinals and
prelates who were partisans of Napoleon were allowed to see him. The
defeat in Russia brought about a radical change; Napoleon now saw the
advantage of arranging some terms of peace, because the harsh treatment
of the venerable head of the greatest Christian communion was being
used against his persecutor, both at home and abroad. Negotiations were
resumed, and under personal pressure from Napoleon, Pius, on condition
that the domains of the Holy See were restored to him, made large
concessions. He gave Napoleon the right to fill all the bishoprics of
France and Italy, except those in the vicinity of Rome, and he allowed
metropolitan institution. Afterwards, on consulting with his advisers,
the Pope published a retraction of his consent, by which the provisions
he had made were annulled. No attention was paid by the Emperor to
this change of attitude except that he ordered the imprisonment of the
Cardinal de Pietro, who he thought had persuaded Pius to change his
mind.In 1814, before the last campaign on French territory, Napoleon
gave the Pope permission to leave Fontainebleau, and shortly before
the final defeat he restored the Papal States. There were no
further relations between the two, the restored Pope and dethroned
Emperor, except that Pius VII, after the Hundred Days and Waterloo,
magnanimously offered the Bonaparte family an asylum in Rome, and later
on made representations to the English government with a view to
reduce the severity of Napoleon’s captivity at St. Helena.It is customary to ascribe to Napoleon creative originality as a
lawgiver. This is a part of the Napoleonic legend that has been upset
by the industrious investigations of the partisans of the French
Revolution, working under a famous professor at the Sorbonne. In
many ways these scholars have rescued from obscurity the positive
achievements of the Revolutionary statesmen, and it is now certain that
the various codes of Napoleon carry out the principles of procedure and
justice foreshadowed in the preliminary work done by the Constituent
Assembly and the Convention. Napoleon’s own temperament is seen in the
influence he brought to bear upon his lawyers to provide for rapidity
in procedure and in execution of judgment, and in the increase of
tribunals in which business men played an important rôle.In education the Emperor’s influence was not so beneficial. He had
little sympathy with any type of training that was not practical,
and he had no sympathy at all with professorial free speech. Indeed,
he expected the teaching profession to take its model from the Grand
Army. There was to be little chance for personal development, each man
marched in an appropriate rank under orders from a superior. The result
of the iron-clad educational régime is acknowledged to have been most
unsatisfactory, and it has been one of the most brilliant and most
arduous achievements of the Third Republic to abolish the Napoleonic
ideals of university teaching, and to substitute for them a system
which encourages local and personal freedom. The change has already
justified itself, for France is now close to Germany as the home of
erudition in many fields of research in which Germany for years justly
claimed an uncontested primacy.The supreme position of Napoleon as a military commander has often
led his admirers to affirm that he was infallible in his strategy. He
encouraged this tendency at St. Helena, for, when he was composing
his Memoirs, he invariably shifted the responsibility for errors in
his battles to the shoulders of his lieutenants. He was an expert
in manipulating figures, and he had such a good memory that he could
always compose a most plausible lie. For years people supposed that
the Russian expedition failed because of the extreme cold, and that
the defeat at Waterloo might have been turned into a victory if
the Emperor’s orders had been strictly carried out by Grouchy and
if Ney had advanced more rapidly, as he was bidden to do by his
commander-in-chief. These are misrepresentations--are the efforts of
a man who wished to manipulate history for his own benefit. When,
however, he was not dictating as an exile, Napoleon often enough
expressed the truth about himself spontaneously. He allowed, for
example, that he had been repeatedly defeated, and on more than one
occasion he conceded to his marshals the possession of military talent
superior to his own. One year after the Russian disaster he owned that
the invasion had been ruined by blunders of his own. He was just as
sweeping, too, in condemning various critical phases of his policy.
He condemned the attack upon Spain not only as a wholesale blunder,
but as a series of blunders in detail, and he characterized the
invasion of Russia, while the Spanish War was unfinished, as a hopeless
undertaking. Once, speaking to Talleyrand, he said, “I have made so
many mistakes in my life that I am not ashamed of them.” It was a
characteristic trait of his outlook on his own career that he imagined
himself carried on as the instrument of deeds and acts which he could
not justify. “I am not,” he once exclaimed, “a man, but a thing.”');

'{"document_id": "The world''s leading conquerors"}'::jsonb, 'Napoleon’s lack of appreciation of moral standards both in public and
in private life is notorious, but he was no hypocrite. The one pleasing
side of his character was his devotion to his family. Here the clear
light of his intellect could not reach. It is true he made grotesque
mistakes in putting his brothers into positions for which they were
manifestly unfitted, but this sign of weakness shows that, after all,
Napoleon was not entirely selfish. He seems to have had little actual
patriotism. He was not a Frenchman either by descent or by sympathy,
and what he accomplished was done at the expense of the French people.
He understood some of their characteristics, but his own point of view
was so practical that there were whole fields of achievement signalized
in the records of French genius that he never appreciated. On lower
planes of action, however, his driving power was immense, and the very
terror he created by the success of his concentrated individualism
prepared the way for that progressive acknowledgment of public justice
and social righteousness which characterized the civilization of
the nineteenth century. In spite of all his limitations, it seems
impossible to point to a more marvelous career in the annals of
humanity.');

 BOOK 1.I.
 DEATH OF LOUIS XV.
 Chapter 1.1.I.
 Louis the Well-Beloved. President Hénault, remarking on royal Surnames of Honour how
 difficult it often is to ascertain not only why, but even when,
 they were conferred, takes occasion in his sleek official way, to
 make a philosophical reflection. “The Surname of _Bien-aimé_
 (Well-beloved),” says he, “which Louis XV. bears, will not leave
 posterity in the same doubt. This Prince, in the year 1744, while
 hastening from one end of his kingdom to the other, and
 suspending his conquests in Flanders that he might fly to the
 assistance of Alsace, was arrested at Metz by a malady which
 threatened to cut short his days. At the news of this, Paris, all
 in terror, seemed a city taken by storm: the churches resounded
 with supplications and groans; the prayers of priests and people
 were every moment interrupted by their sobs: and it was from an
 interest so dear and tender that this Surname of _Bien-aimé_
 fashioned itself—a title higher still than all the rest which
 this great Prince has earned.”[1] So stands it written; in lasting memorial of that year 1744.
 Thirty other years have come and gone; and “this great Prince”
 again lies sick; but in how altered circumstances now! Churches
 resound not with excessive groanings; Paris is stoically calm:
 sobs interrupt no prayers, for indeed none are offered; except
 Priests’ Litanies, read or chanted at fixed money-rate per hour,
 which are not liable to interruption. The shepherd of the people
 has been carried home from Little Trianon, heavy of heart, and
 been put to bed in his own Château of Versailles: the flock knows
 it, and heeds it not. At most, in the immeasurable tide of French
 Speech (which ceases not day after day, and only ebbs towards the
 short hours of night), may this of the royal sickness emerge from
 time to time as an article of news. Bets are doubtless depending;
 nay, some people “express themselves loudly in the streets.”[2]
 But for the rest, on green field and steepled city, the May sun
 shines out, the May evening fades; and men ply their useful or
 useless business as if no Louis lay in danger. Dame Dubarry, indeed, might pray, if she had a talent for it;
 Duke d’Aiguillon too, Maupeou and the Parlement Maupeou: these,
 as they sit in their high places, with France harnessed under
 their feet, know well on what basis they continue there. Look to
 it, D’Aiguillon; sharply as thou didst, from the Mill of St.
 Cast, on Quiberon and the invading English; thou, “covered if not
 with glory yet with meal!” Fortune was ever accounted inconstant:
 and each dog has but his day. Forlorn enough languished Duke d’Aiguillon, some years ago;
 covered, as we said, with meal; nay with worse. For La Chalotais,
 the Breton Parlementeer, accused him not only of poltroonery and
 tyranny, but even of _concussion_ (official plunder of money);
 which accusations it was easier to get “quashed” by backstairs
 Influences than to get answered: neither could the thoughts, or
 even the tongues, of men be tied. Thus, under disastrous eclipse,
 had this grand-nephew of the great Richelieu to glide about;
 unworshipped by the world; resolute Choiseul, the abrupt proud
 man, disdaining him, or even forgetting him. Little prospect but
 to glide into Gascony, to rebuild Châteaus there,[3] and die
 inglorious killing game! However, in the year 1770, a certain
 young soldier, Dumouriez by name, returning from Corsica, could
 see “with sorrow, at Compiègne, the old King of France, on foot,
 with doffed hat, in sight of his army, at the side of a
 magnificent phaeton, doing homage to the—Dubarry.”[4] Much lay therein! Thereby, for one thing, could D’Aiguillon
 postpone the rebuilding of his Château, and rebuild his fortunes
 first. For stout Choiseul would discern in the Dubarry nothing
 but a wonderfully dizened Scarlet-woman; and go on his way as if
 she were not. Intolerable: the source of sighs, tears, of
 pettings and pouting; which would not end till “France” (La
 France, as she named her royal valet) finally mustered heart to
 see Choiseul; and with that “quivering in the chin (_tremblement
 du menton_)” natural in such case,[5] faltered out a dismissal:
 dismissal of his last substantial man, but pacification of his
 scarlet-woman. Thus D’Aiguillon rose again, and culminated. And
 with him there rose Maupeou, the banisher of Parlements; who
 plants you a refractory President “at Croe in Combrailles on the
 top of steep rocks, inaccessible except by litters,” there to
 consider himself. Likewise there rose Abbé Terray, dissolute
 Financier, paying eightpence in the shilling,—so that wits
 exclaim in some press at the playhouse, ‘Where is Abbé Terray,
 that he might reduce us to two-thirds!’ And so have these
 individuals (verily by black-art) built them a Domdaniel, or
 enchanted Dubarrydom; call it an Armida-Palace, where they dwell
 pleasantly; Chancellor Maupeou “playing blind-man’s-buff” with
 the scarlet Enchantress; or gallantly presenting her with dwarf
 Negroes;—and a Most Christian King has unspeakable peace within
 doors, whatever he may have without. “My Chancellor is a
 scoundrel; but I cannot do without him.”[6] Beautiful Armida-Palace, where the inmates live enchanted lives;
 lapped in soft music of adulation; waited on by the splendours of
 the world;—which nevertheless hangs wondrously as by a single
 hair. Should the Most Christian King die; or even get seriously
 afraid of dying! For, alas, had not the fair haughty Châteauroux
 to fly, with wet cheeks and flaming heart, from that Fever-scene
 at Metz; driven forth by sour shavelings? She hardly returned,
 when fever and shavelings were both swept into the background.
 Pompadour too, when Damiens wounded Royalty “slightly, under the
 fifth rib,” and our drive to Trianon went off futile, in shrieks
 and madly shaken torches,—had to pack, and be in readiness: yet
 did not go, the wound not proving poisoned. For his Majesty has
 religious faith; believes, at least in a Devil. And now a third
 peril; and who knows what may be in it! For the Doctors look
 grave; ask privily, If his Majesty had not the small-pox long
 ago?—and doubt it may have been a false kind. Yes, Maupeou,
 pucker those sinister brows of thine, and peer out on it with thy
 malign rat-eyes: it is a questionable case. Sure only that man is
 mortal; that with the life of one mortal snaps irrevocably the
 wonderfulest talisman, and all Dubarrydom rushes off, with
 tumult, into infinite Space; and ye, as subterranean Apparitions
 are wont, vanish utterly,—leaving only a smell of sulphur! These, and what holds of these may pray,—to Beelzebub, or whoever
 will hear them. But from the rest of France there comes, as was
 said, no prayer; or one of an _opposite_ character, “expressed
 openly in the streets.” Château or Hôtel, were an enlightened
 Philosophism scrutinises many things, is not given to prayer:
 neither are Rossbach victories, Terray Finances, nor, say only
 “sixty thousand _Lettres de Cachet_” (which is Maupeou’s share),
 persuasives towards that. O Hénault! Prayers? From a France
 smitten (by black-art) with plague after plague, and lying now in
 shame and pain, with a Harlot’s foot on its neck, what prayer can
 come? Those lank scarecrows, that prowl hunger-stricken through
 all highways and byways of French Existence, will they pray? The
 dull millions that, in the workshop or furrowfield, grind
 fore-done at the wheel of Labour, like haltered gin-horses, if
 blind so much the quieter? Or they that in the Bicêtre Hospital,
 “eight to a bed,” lie waiting their manumission? Dim are those
 heads of theirs, dull stagnant those hearts: to them the great
 Sovereign is known mainly as the great Regrater of Bread. If they
 hear of his sickness, they will answer with a dull _Tant pis pour
 lui;_ or with the question, Will he die? Yes, will he die? that is now, for all France, the grand
 question, and hope; whereby alone the King’s sickness has still
 some interest.
 Chapter 1.1.II.
 Realised Ideals. Such a changed France have we; and a changed Louis. Changed,
 truly; and further than thou yet seest!—To the eye of History
 many things, in that sick-room of Louis, are now visible, which
 to the Courtiers there present were invisible. For indeed it is
 well said, “in every object there is inexhaustible meaning; the
 eye sees in it what the eye brings means of seeing.” To Newton
 and to Newton’s Dog Diamond, what a different pair of Universes;
 while the painting on the optical retina of both was, most
 likely, the same! Let the Reader here, in this sick-room of
 Louis, endeavour to look with the mind too. Time was when men could (so to speak) of a given man, by
 nourishing and decorating him with fit appliances, to the due
 pitch, _make_ themselves a King, almost as the Bees do; and what
 was still more to the purpose, loyally obey him when made. The
 man so nourished and decorated, thenceforth named royal, does
 verily bear rule; and is said, and even thought, to be, for
 example, “prosecuting conquests in Flanders,” when he lets
 himself like luggage be carried thither: and no light luggage;
 covering miles of road. For he has his unblushing Châteauroux,
 with her band-boxes and rouge-pots, at his side; so that, at
 every new station, a wooden gallery must be run up between their
 lodgings. He has not only his _Maison-Bouche_, and _Valetaille_
 without end, but his very Troop of Players, with their pasteboard
 coulisses, thunder-barrels, their kettles, fiddles,
 stage-wardrobes, portable larders (and chaffering and quarrelling
 enough); all mounted in wagons, tumbrils, second-hand
 chaises,—sufficient not to conquer Flanders, but the patience of
 the world. With such a flood of loud jingling appurtenances does
 he lumber along, prosecuting his conquests in Flanders; wonderful
 to behold. So nevertheless it was and had been: to some solitary
 thinker it might seem strange; but even to him inevitable, not
 unnatural. For ours is a most fictile world; and man is the most fingent
 plastic of creatures. A world not fixable; not fathomable! An
 unfathomable Somewhat, which is _Not we;_ which we can work with,
 and live amidst,—and model, miraculously in our miraculous Being,
 and name World.—But if the very Rocks and Rivers (as Metaphysic
 teaches) are, in strict language, _made_ by those outward Senses
 of ours, how much more, by the Inward Sense, are all Phenomena of
 the spiritual kind: Dignities, Authorities, Holies, Unholies!
 Which inward sense, moreover is not permanent like the outward
 ones, but forever growing and changing. Does not the Black
 African take of Sticks and Old Clothes (say, exported
 Monmouth-Street cast-clothes) what will suffice, and of these,
 cunningly combining them, fabricate for himself an Eidolon (Idol,
 or _Thing Seen_), and name it _Mumbo-Jumbo;_ which he can
 thenceforth pray to, with upturned awestruck eye, not without
 hope? The white European mocks; but ought rather to consider; and
 see whether he, at home, could not do the like a little more
 wisely. So it _was_, we say, in those conquests of Flanders, thirty years
 ago: but so it no longer is. Alas, much more lies sick than poor
 Louis: not the French King only, but the French Kingship; this
 too, after long rough tear and wear, is breaking down. The world
 is all so changed; so much that seemed vigorous has sunk
 decrepit, so much that was not is beginning to be!—Borne over the
 Atlantic, to the closing ear of Louis, King by the Grace of God,
 what sounds are these; muffled ominous, new in our centuries?
 Boston Harbour is black with unexpected Tea: behold a
 Pennsylvanian Congress gather; and ere long, on Bunker Hill,
 DEMOCRACY announcing, in rifle-volleys death-winged, under her
 Star Banner, to the tune of Yankee-doodle-doo, that she is born,
 and, whirlwind-like, will envelope the whole world! Sovereigns die and Sovereignties: how all dies, and is for a Time
 only; is a “Time-phantasm, yet reckons itself real!” The
 Merovingian Kings, slowly wending on their bullock-carts through
 the streets of Paris, with their long hair flowing, have all
 wended slowly on,—into Eternity. Charlemagne sleeps at Salzburg,
 with truncheon grounded; only Fable expecting that he will
 awaken. Charles the Hammer, Pepin Bow-legged, where now is their
 eye of menace, their voice of command? Rollo and his shaggy
 Northmen cover not the Seine with ships; but have sailed off on a
 longer voyage. The hair of Towhead (_Tête d’étoupes_) now needs
 no combing; Iron-cutter (_Taillefer_) cannot cut a cobweb; shrill
 Fredegonda, shrill Brunhilda have had out their hot life-scold,
 and lie silent, their hot life-frenzy cooled. Neither from that
 black Tower de Nesle descends now darkling the doomed gallant, in
 his sack, to the Seine waters; plunging into Night: for Dame de
 Nesle now cares not for this world’s gallantry, heeds not this
 world’s scandal; Dame de Nesle is herself gone into Night. They
 are all gone; sunk,—down, down, with the tumult they made; and
 the rolling and the trampling of ever new generations passes over
 them, and they hear it not any more forever. And yet withal has there not been realised somewhat? Consider (to
 go no further) these strong Stone-edifices, and what they hold!
 Mud-Town of the Borderers (_Lutetia Parisiorum_ or _Barisiorum_)
 has paved itself, has spread over all the Seine Islands, and far
 and wide on each bank, and become City of Paris, sometimes
 boasting to be “Athens of Europe,” and even “Capital of the
 Universe.” Stone towers frown aloft; long-lasting, grim with a
 thousand years. Cathedrals are there, and a Creed (or memory of a
 Creed) in them; Palaces, and a State and Law. Thou seest the
 Smoke-vapour; _un_extinguished Breath as of a thing living.
 Labour’s thousand hammers ring on her anvils: also a more
 miraculous Labour works noiselessly, not with the Hand but with
 the Thought. How have cunning workmen in all crafts, with their
 cunning head and right-hand, tamed the Four Elements to be their
 ministers; yoking the winds to their Sea-chariot, making the very
 Stars their Nautical Timepiece;—and written and collected a
 _Bibliothèque du Roi;_ among whose Books is the Hebrew Book! A
 wondrous race of creatures: _these_ have been realised, and what
 of Skill is in these: call not the Past Time, with all its
 confused wretchednesses, a lost one. Observe, however, that of man’s whole terrestrial possessions and
 attainments, unspeakably the noblest are his Symbols, divine or
 divine-seeming; under which he marches and fights, with
 victorious assurance, in this life-battle: what we can call his
 Realised Ideals. Of which realised ideals, omitting the rest,
 consider only these two: his Church, or spiritual Guidance; his
 Kingship, or temporal one. The Church: what a word was there;
 richer than Golconda and the treasures of the world! In the heart
 of the remotest mountains rises the little Kirk; the Dead all
 slumbering round it, under their white memorial-stones, “in hope
 of a happy resurrection:”—dull wert thou, O Reader, if never in
 any hour (say of moaning midnight, when such Kirk hung spectral
 in the sky, and Being was as if swallowed up of Darkness) it
 spoke to thee—things unspeakable, that went into thy soul’s soul.
 Strong was he that had a Church, what we can call a Church: he
 stood thereby, though “in the centre of Immensities, in the
 conflux of Eternities,” yet manlike towards God and man; the
 vague shoreless Universe had become for him a firm city, and
 dwelling which he knew. Such virtue was in Belief; in these
 words, well spoken: _I believe_. Well might men prize their
 _Credo_, and raise stateliest Temples for it, and reverend
 Hierarchies, and give it the tithe of their substance; it was
 worth living for and dying for. Neither was that an inconsiderable moment when wild armed men
 first raised their Strongest aloft on the buckler-throne, and
 with clanging armour and hearts, said solemnly: Be thou our
 Acknowledged Strongest! In such Acknowledged Strongest (well
 named King, _Kön-ning,_ Can-ning, or Man that was Able) what a
 Symbol shone now for them,—significant with the destinies of the
 world! A Symbol of true Guidance in return for loving Obedience;
 properly, if he knew it, the prime want of man. A Symbol which
 might be called sacred; for is there not, in reverence for what
 is better than we, an indestructible sacredness? On which ground,
 too, it was well said there lay in the Acknowledged Strongest a
 divine right; as surely there might in the Strongest, whether
 Acknowledged or not,—considering _who_ it was that made him
 strong. And so, in the midst of confusions and unutterable
 incongruities (as all growth is confused), did this of Royalty,
 with Loyalty environing it, spring up; and grow mysteriously,
 subduing and assimilating (for a principle of Life was in it);
 till it also had grown world-great, and was among the main Facts
 of our modern existence. Such a Fact, that Louis XIV., for
 example, could answer the expostulatory Magistrate with his
 ‘_L’Etat c’est moi_ (The State? I am the State);’ and be replied
 to by silence and abashed looks. So far had accident and
 forethought; had your Louis Elevenths, with the leaden Virgin in
 their hatband, and torture-wheels and conical _oubliettes_
 (man-eating!) under their feet; your Henri Fourths, with their
 prophesied social millennium, “when every peasant should have his
 fowl in the pot;” and on the whole, the fertility of this most
 fertile Existence (named of Good and Evil),—brought it, in the
 matter of the Kingship. Wondrous! Concerning which may we not
 again say, that in the huge mass of Evil, as it rolls and swells,
 there is ever some Good working imprisoned; working towards
 deliverance and triumph? How such Ideals do realise themselves; and grow, wondrously, from
 amid the incongruous ever-fluctuating chaos of the Actual: this
 is what World-History, if it teach any thing, has to teach us,
 How they grow; and, after long stormy growth, bloom out mature,
 supreme; then quickly (for the blossom is brief) fall into decay;
 sorrowfully dwindle; and crumble down, or rush down, noisily or
 noiselessly disappearing. The blossom is so brief; as of some
 centennial Cactus-flower, which after a century of waiting shines
 out for hours! Thus from the day when rough Clovis, in the Champ
 de Mars, in sight of his whole army, had to cleave retributively
 the head of that rough Frank, with sudden battleaxe, and the
 fierce words, ‘It was thus thou clavest the vase’ (St. Remi’s and
 mine) ‘at Soissons,’ forward to Louis the Grand and his _L’Etat
 c’est moi_, we count some twelve hundred years: and now this the
 very next Louis is dying, and so much dying with him!—Nay, thus
 too, if Catholicism, with and against Feudalism (but _not_
 against Nature and her bounty), gave us English a Shakspeare and
 Era of Shakspeare, and so produced a blossom of Catholicism—it
 was not till Catholicism itself, so far as Law could abolish it,
 had been abolished here. But of those decadent ages in which no Ideal either grows or
 blossoms? When Belief and Loyalty have passed away, and only the
 cant and false echo of them remains; and all Solemnity has become
 Pageantry; and the Creed of persons in authority has become one
 of two things: an Imbecility or a Macchiavelism? Alas, of these
 ages World-History can take no notice; they have to become
 compressed more and more, and finally suppressed in the Annals of
 Mankind; blotted out as spurious,—which indeed they are. Hapless
 ages: wherein, if ever in any, it is an unhappiness to be born.
 To be born, and to learn only, by every tradition and example,
 that God’s Universe is Belial’s and a Lie; and “the Supreme
 Quack” the hierarch of men! In which mournfulest faith,
 nevertheless, do we not see whole generations (two, and sometimes
 even three successively) live, what they call living; and
 vanish,—without chance of reappearance? In such a decadent age, or one fast verging that way, had our
 poor Louis been born. Grant also that if the French Kingship had
 not, by course of Nature, long to live, he of all men was the man
 to accelerate Nature. The Blossom of French Royalty, cactus-like,
 has accordingly made an astonishing progress. In those Metz days,
 it was still standing with all its petals, though bedimmed by
 Orleans Regents and _Roué_ Ministers and Cardinals; but now, in
 1774, we behold it bald, and the virtue nigh gone out of it.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Disastrous indeed does it look with those same “realised ideals,”
 one and all! The Church, which in its palmy season, seven hundred
 years ago, could make an Emperor wait barefoot, in penance-shift;
 three days, in the snow, has for centuries seen itself decaying;
 reduced even to forget old purposes and enmities, and join
 interest with the Kingship: on this younger strength it would
 fain stay its decrepitude; and these two will henceforth stand
 and fall together. Alas, the Sorbonne still sits there, in its
 old mansion; but mumbles only jargon of dotage, and no longer
 leads the consciences of men: not the Sorbonne; it is
 _Encyclopédies, Philosophie_, and who knows what nameless
 innumerable multitude of ready Writers, profane Singers,
 Romancers, Players, Disputators, and Pamphleteers, that now form
 the Spiritual Guidance of the world. The world’s Practical
 Guidance too is lost, or has glided into the same miscellaneous
 hands. Who is it that the King (_Able-man_, named also _Roi,
 Rex,_ or Director) now guides? His own huntsmen and prickers:
 when there is to be no hunt, it is well said, “_Le Roi ne fera
 rien_ (Today his Majesty will do _nothing_).”[7] He lives and
 lingers there, because he is living there, and none has yet laid
 hands on him. The nobles, in like manner, have nearly ceased either to guide or
 misguide; and are now, as their master is, little more than
 ornamental figures. It is long since they have done with
 butchering one another or their king: the Workers, protected,
 encouraged by Majesty, have ages ago built walled towns, and
 there ply their crafts; will permit no Robber Baron to “live by
 the saddle,” but maintain a gallows to prevent it. Ever since
 that period of the _Fronde_, the Noble has changed his fighting
 sword into a court rapier, and now loyally attends his king as
 ministering satellite; divides the spoil, not now by violence and
 murder, but by soliciting and finesse. These men call themselves
 supports of the throne, singular gilt-pasteboard _caryatides_ in
 that singular edifice! For the rest, their privileges every way
 are now much curtailed. That law authorizing a Seigneur, as he
 returned from hunting, to kill not more than two Serfs, and
 refresh his feet in their warm blood and bowels, has fallen into
 perfect desuetude,—and even into incredibility; for if Deputy
 Lapoule can believe in it, and call for the abrogation of it, so
 cannot we.[8] No Charolois, for these last fifty years, though
 never so fond of shooting, has been in use to bring down slaters
 and plumbers, and see them roll from their roofs;[9] but contents
 himself with partridges and grouse. Close-viewed, their industry
 and function is that of dressing gracefully and eating
 sumptuously. As for their debauchery and depravity, it is perhaps
 unexampled since the era of Tiberius and Commodus. Nevertheless,
 one has still partly a feeling with the lady Maréchale: ‘Depend
 upon it, Sir, God thinks twice before damning a man of that
 quality.’[10] These people, of old, surely had virtues, uses; or
 they could not have been there. Nay, one virtue they are still
 required to have (for mortal man cannot live without a
 conscience): the virtue of perfect readiness to fight duels. Such are the shepherds of the people: and now how fares it with
 the flock? With the flock, as is inevitable, it fares ill, and
 ever worse. They are not tended, they are only regularly shorn.
 They are sent for, to do statute-labour, to pay statute-taxes; to
 fatten battle-fields (named “Bed of honour”) with their bodies,
 in quarrels which are not theirs; their hand and toil is in every
 possession of man; but for themselves they have little or no
 possession. Untaught, uncomforted, unfed; to pine dully in thick
 obscuration, in squalid destitution and obstruction: this is the
 lot of the millions; _peuple taillable et corvéable à merci et
 miséricorde_. In Brittany they once rose in revolt at the first
 introduction of Pendulum Clocks; thinking it had something to do
 with the _Gabelle_. Paris requires to be cleared out periodically
 by the Police; and the horde of hunger-stricken vagabonds to be
 sent wandering again over space—for a time. “During one such
 periodical clearance,” says Lacretelle, “in May, 1750, the Police
 had presumed withal to carry off some reputable people’s
 children, in the hope of extorting ransoms for them. The mothers
 fill the public places with cries of despair; crowds gather, get
 excited: so many women in destraction run about exaggerating the
 alarm: an absurd and horrid fable arises among the people; it is
 said that the doctors have ordered a Great Person to take baths
 of young human blood for the restoration of his own, all spoiled
 by debaucheries. Some of the rioters,” adds Lacretelle, quite
 coolly, “were hanged on the following days:” the Police went
 on.[11] O ye poor naked wretches! and this, then, is your
 inarticulate cry to Heaven, as of a dumb tortured animal, crying
 from uttermost depths of pain and debasement? Do these azure
 skies, like a dead crystalline vault, only reverberate the echo
 of it on you? Respond to it only by “hanging on the following
 days?”—Not so: not forever! Ye are heard in Heaven. And the
 answer too will come,—in a horror of great darkness, and shakings
 of the world, and a cup of trembling which all the nations shall
 drink. Remark, meanwhile, how from amid the wrecks and dust of this
 universal Decay new Powers are fashioning themselves, adapted to
 the new time and its destinies. Besides the old Noblesse,
 originally of Fighters, there is a new recognised Noblesse of
 Lawyers; whose gala-day and proud battle-day even now is. An
 unrecognised Noblesse of Commerce; powerful enough, with money in
 its pocket. Lastly, powerfulest of all, least recognised of all,
 a Noblesse of Literature; without steel on their thigh, without
 gold in their purse, but with the “grand thaumaturgic faculty of
 Thought” in their head. French Philosophism has arisen; in which
 little word how much do we include! Here, indeed, lies properly
 the cardinal symptom of the whole wide-spread malady. Faith is
 gone out; Scepticism is come in. Evil abounds and accumulates: no
 man has Faith to withstand it, to amend it, to begin by amending
 himself; it must even go on accumulating. While hollow langour
 and vacuity is the lot of the Upper, and want and stagnation of
 the Lower, and universal misery is very certain, what other thing
 is certain? That a Lie cannot be believed! Philosophism knows
 only this: her other belief is mainly that, in spiritual
 supersensual matters no Belief is possible. Unhappy! Nay, as yet
 the Contradiction of a Lie is some kind of Belief; but the Lie
 with its Contradiction once swept away, what will remain? The
 five unsatiated Senses will remain, the sixth insatiable Sense
 (of vanity); the whole _dæmonic_ nature of man will
 remain,—hurled forth to rage blindly without rule or rein; savage
 itself, yet with all the tools and weapons of civilisation; a
 spectacle new in History. In such a France, as in a Powder-tower, where fire unquenched and
 now unquenchable is smoking and smouldering all round, has Louis
 XV. lain down to die. With Pompadourism and Dubarryism, his
 Fleur-de-lis has been shamefully struck down in all lands and on
 all seas; Poverty invades even the Royal Exchequer, and
 Tax-farming can squeeze out no more; there is a quarrel of
 twenty-five years’ standing with the Parlement; everywhere Want,
 Dishonesty, Unbelief, and hotbrained Sciolists for
 state-physicians: it is a portentous hour. Such things can the eye of History see in this sick-room of King
 Louis, which were invisible to the Courtiers there. It is twenty
 years, gone Christmas-day, since Lord Chesterfield, summing up
 what he had noted of this same France, wrote, and sent off by
 post, the following words, that have become memorable: “In short,
 all the symptoms which I have ever met with in History, previous
 to great Changes and Revolutions in government, now exist and
 daily increase in France.”[12]
 Chapter 1.1.III.
 Viaticum. For the present, however, the grand question with the Governors
 of France is: Shall extreme unction, or other ghostly viaticum
 (to Louis, not to France), be administered? It is a deep question. For, if administered, if so much as spoken
 of, must not, on the very threshold of the business, Witch
 Dubarry vanish; hardly to return should Louis even recover? With
 her vanishes Duke d’Aiguillon and Company, and all their
 Armida-Palace, as was said; Chaos swallows the whole again, and
 there is left nothing but a smell of brimstone. But then, on the
 other hand, what will the Dauphinists and Choiseulists say? Nay
 what may the royal martyr himself say, should he happen to get
 deadly worse, without getting delirious? For the present, he
 still kisses the Dubarry hand; so we, from the ante-room, can
 note: but afterwards? Doctors’ bulletins may run as they are
 ordered, but it is “confluent small-pox,”—of which, as is
 whispered too, the Gatekeeper’s once so buxom Daughter lies ill:
 and Louis XV. is not a man to be trifled with in his viaticum.
 Was he not wont to catechise his very girls in the
 _Parc-aux-cerfs_, and pray with and for them, that they might
 preserve their—orthodoxy?[13] A strange fact, not an unexampled
 one; for there is no animal so strange as man. For the moment, indeed, it were all well, could Archbishop
 Beaumont but be prevailed upon—to wink with one eye! Alas,
 Beaumont would himself so fain do it: for, singular to tell, the
 Church too, and whole posthumous hope of Jesuitism, now hangs by
 the apron of this same unmentionable woman. But then “the force
 of public opinion”? Rigorous Christophe de Beaumont, who has
 spent his life in persecuting hysterical Jansenists and
 incredulous Non-confessors; or even their dead bodies, if no
 better might be,—how shall he now open Heaven’s gate, and give
 Absolution with the _corpus delicti_ still under his nose? Our
 Grand-Almoner Roche-Aymon, for his part, will not higgle with a
 royal sinner about turning of the key: but there are other
 Churchmen; there is a King’s Confessor, foolish Abbé Moudon; and
 Fanaticism and Decency are not yet extinct. On the whole, what is
 to be done? The doors can be well watched; the Medical Bulletin
 adjusted; and much, as usual, be hoped for from time and chance. The doors are well watched, no improper figure can enter. Indeed,
 few wish to enter; for the putrid infection reaches even to the
 _Œil-de-Bœuf;_ so that “more than fifty fall sick, and ten die.”
 Mesdames the Princesses alone wait at the loathsome sick-bed;
 impelled by filial piety. The three Princesses, _Graille, Chiffe,
 Coche_ (Rag, Snip, Pig, as he was wont to name them), are
 assiduous there; when all have fled. The fourth Princess _Loque_
 (Dud), as we guess, is already in the Nunnery, and can only give
 her orisons. Poor _Graille_ and Sisterhood, they have never known
 a Father: such is the hard bargain Grandeur must make. Scarcely
 at the _Débotter_ (when Royalty took off its boots) could they
 snatch up their “enormous hoops, gird the long train round their
 waists, huddle on their black cloaks of taffeta up to the very
 chin;” and so, in fit appearance of full dress, “every evening at
 six,” walk majestically in; receive their royal kiss on the brow;
 and then walk majestically out again, to embroidery,
 small-scandal, prayers, and vacancy. If Majesty came some
 morning, with coffee of its own making, and swallowed it with
 them hastily while the dogs were uncoupling for the hunt, it was
 received as a grace of Heaven.[14] Poor withered ancient women!
 in the wild tossings that yet await your fragile existence,
 before it be crushed and broken; as ye fly through hostile
 countries, over tempestuous seas, are almost taken by the Turks;
 and wholly, in the Sansculottic Earthquake, know not your right
 hand from your left, be this always an assured place in your
 remembrance: for the act was good and loving! To us also it is a
 little sunny spot, in that dismal howling waste, where we hardly
 find another. Meanwhile, what shall an impartial prudent Courtier do? In these
 delicate circumstances, while not only death or life, but even
 sacrament or no sacrament, is a question, the skilfulest may
 falter. Few are so happy as the Duke d’Orléans and the Prince de
 Condé; who can themselves, with volatile salts, attend the King’s
 ante-chamber; and, at the same time, send their brave sons (Duke
 de Chartres, _Egalité_ that is to be; Duke de Bourbon, one day
 Condé too, and famous among Dotards) to wait upon the Dauphin.
 With another few, it is a resolution taken; _jacta est alea_. Old
 Richelieu,—when Beaumont, driven by public opinion, is at last
 for entering the sick-room,—will twitch him by the rochet, into a
 recess; and there, with his old dissipated mastiff-face, and the
 oiliest vehemence, be seen pleading (and even, as we judge by
 Beaumont’s change of colour, prevailing) “that the King be not
 killed by a proposition in Divinity.” Duke de Fronsac, son of
 Richelieu, can follow his father: when the Curé of Versailles
 whimpers something about sacraments, he will threaten to “throw
 him out of the window if he mention such a thing.” Happy these, we may say; but to the rest that hover between two
 opinions, is it not trying? He who would understand to what a
 pass Catholicism, and much else, had now got; and how the symbols
 of the Holiest have become gambling-dice of the Basest,—must read
 the narrative of those things by Besenval, and Soulavie, and the
 other Court Newsmen of the time. He will see the Versailles
 Galaxy all scattered asunder, grouped into new ever-shifting
 Constellations. There are nods and sagacious glances;
 go-betweens, silk dowagers mysteriously gliding, with smiles for
 this constellation, sighs for that: there is tremor, of hope or
 desperation, in several hearts. There is the pale grinning Shadow
 of Death, ceremoniously ushered along by another grinning Shadow,
 of Etiquette: at intervals the growl of Chapel Organs, like
 prayer by machinery; proclaiming, as in a kind of horrid diabolic
 horse-laughter, _Vanity of vanities, all is Vanity!_
 Chapter 1.1.IV.
 Louis the Unforgotten. Poor Louis! With these it is a hollow phantasmagory, where like
 mimes they mope and mowl, and utter false sounds for hire; but
 with thee it is frightful earnest. Frightful to all men is Death; from of old named King of Terrors.
 Our little compact home of an Existence, where we dwelt
 complaining, yet as in a home, is passing, in dark agonies, into
 an Unknown of Separation, Foreignness, unconditioned Possibility.
 The Heathen Emperor asks of his soul: Into what places art thou
 now departing? The Catholic King must answer: To the Judgment-bar
 of the Most High God! Yes, it is a summing-up of Life; a final
 settling, and giving-in the “account of the deeds done in the
 body:” they are done now; and lie there unalterable, and do bear
 their fruits, long as Eternity shall last. Louis XV. had always the kingliest abhorrence of Death. Unlike
 that praying Duke of Orleans, _Egalité’s_ grandfather,—for indeed
 several of them had a touch of madness,—who honesty believed that
 there was no Death! He, if the Court Newsmen can be believed,
 started up once on a time, glowing with sulphurous contempt and
 indignation on his poor Secretary, who had stumbled on the words,
 _feu roi d’Espagne_ (the late King of Spain): ‘_Feu roi,
 Monsieur?_’—‘_Monseigneur_,’ hastily answered the trembling but
 adroit man of business, ‘_c’est une titre qu’ils prennent_ (’tis
 a title they take).’[15] Louis, we say, was not so happy; but he
 did what he could. He would not suffer Death to be spoken of;
 avoided the sight of churchyards, funereal monuments, and
 whatsoever could bring it to mind. It is the resource of the
 Ostrich; who, hard hunted, sticks his foolish head in the ground,
 and would fain forget that his foolish unseeing body is not
 unseen too. Or sometimes, with a spasmodic antagonism,
 significant of the same thing, and of more, he _would_ go; or
 stopping his court carriages, would send into churchyards, and
 ask “how many new graves there were today,” though it gave his
 poor Pompadour the disagreeablest qualms. We can figure the
 thought of Louis that day, when, all royally caparisoned for
 hunting, he met, at some sudden turning in the Wood of Senart, a
 ragged Peasant with a coffin: ‘For whom?’—It was for a poor
 brother slave, whom Majesty had sometimes noticed slaving in
 those quarters. ‘What did he die of?’—‘Of hunger:’—the King gave
 his steed the spur.[16] But figure his thought, when Death is now clutching at his own
 heart-strings, unlooked for, inexorable! Yes, poor Louis, Death
 has found thee. No palace walls or life-guards, gorgeous
 tapestries or gilt buckram of stiffest ceremonial could keep him
 out; but he is here, here at thy very life-breath, and will
 extinguish it. Thou, whose whole existence hitherto was a chimera
 and scenic show, at length becomest a reality: sumptuous
 Versailles bursts asunder, like a dream, into void Immensity;
 Time is done, and all the scaffolding of Time falls wrecked with
 hideous clangour round thy soul: the pale Kingdoms yawn open;
 there must thou enter, naked, all unking’d, and await what is
 appointed thee! Unhappy man, there as thou turnest, in dull
 agony, on thy bed of weariness, what a thought is thine!
 Purgatory and Hell-fire, now all-too possible, in the prospect;
 in the retrospect,—alas, what thing didst thou do that were not
 better undone; what mortal didst thou generously help; what
 sorrow hadst thou mercy on? Do the “five hundred thousand”
 ghosts, who sank shamefully on so many battle-fields from
 Rossbach to Quebec, that thy Harlot might take revenge for an
 epigram,—crowd round thee in this hour? Thy foul Harem; the
 curses of mothers, the tears and infamy of daughters? Miserable
 man! thou “hast done evil as thou couldst:” thy whole existence
 seems one hideous abortion and mistake of Nature; the use and
 meaning of thee not yet known. Wert thou a fabulous Griffin,
 _devouring_ the works of men; daily dragging virgins to thy
 cave;—clad also in scales that no spear would pierce: no spear
 but Death’s? A Griffin not fabulous but real! Frightful, O Louis,
 seem these moments for thee.—We will pry no further into the
 horrors of a sinner’s death-bed. And yet let no meanest man lay flattering unction to his soul.
 Louis was a Ruler; but art not thou also one? His wide France,
 look at it from the Fixed Stars (themselves not yet Infinitude),
 is no wider than thy narrow brickfield, where thou too didst
 faithfully, or didst unfaithfully. Man, “Symbol of Eternity
 imprisoned into Time!” it is not thy works, which are all mortal,
 infinitely little, and the greatest no greater than the least,
 but only the Spirit thou workest in, that can have worth or
 continuance. But reflect, in any case, what a life-problem this of poor Louis,
 when he rose as _Bien-Aimé_ from that Metz sick-bed, really was!
 What son of Adam could have swayed such incoherences into
 coherence? Could he? Blindest Fortune alone has cast _him_ on the
 top of it: he swims there; can as little sway it as the drift-log
 sways the wind-tossed moon-stirred Atlantic. ‘What have I done to
 be so loved?’ he said then. He may say now: What have I done to
 be so hated? Thou hast done nothing, poor Louis! Thy fault is
 properly even this, that thou didst _nothing_. What could poor
 Louis do? Abdicate, and wash his hands of it,—in favour of the
 first that would accept! Other clear wisdom there was none for
 him. As it was, he stood gazing dubiously, the absurdest mortal
 extant (a very Solecism Incarnate), into the absurdest confused
 world;—wherein at lost nothing seemed so certain as that he, the
 incarnate Solecism, had five senses; that were Flying Tables
 (_Tables Volantes_, which vanish through the floor, to come back
 reloaded). and a _Parc-aux-cerfs_. Whereby at least we have again this historical curiosity: a human
 being in an original position; swimming passively, as on some
 boundless “Mother of Dead Dogs,” towards issues which he partly
 saw. For Louis had withal a kind of insight in him. So, when a
 new Minister of Marine, or what else it might be, came announcing
 his new era, the Scarlet-woman would hear from the lips of
 Majesty at supper: ‘Yes, he spread out his ware like another;
 promised the beautifulest things in the world; not a thing of
 which will come: he does not know this region; he will see.’ Or
 again: ‘’Tis the twentieth time I hear all that; France will
 never get a Navy, I believe.’ How touching also was this: ‘If _I_
 were Lieutenant of Police, I would prohibit those Paris
 cabriolets.’[17] Doomed mortal;—for is it not a doom to be Solecism incarnate! A
 new _Roi Fainéant_, King Donothing; but with the strangest new
 _Mayor of the Palace:_ no bow-legged Pepin now for _Mayor_, but
 that same cloud-capt, fire-breathing Spectre of DEMOCRACY;
 incalculable, which is enveloping the world!—Was Louis no
 wickeder than this or the other private Donothing and Eatall;
 such as we often enough see, under the name of Man, and even Man
 of Pleasure, cumbering God’s diligent Creation, for a time? Say,
 wretcheder! His Life-solecism was seen and felt of a whole
 scandalised world; him endless Oblivion cannot engulf, and
 swallow to endless depths,—not yet for a generation or two. However, be this as it will, we remark, not without interest,
 that “on the evening of the 4th,” Dame Dubarry issues from the
 sick-room, with perceptible “trouble in her visage.” It is the
 fourth evening of May, year of Grace 1774. Such a whispering in
 the Œil-de-Bœuf! Is he dying then? What can be said is, that
 Dubarry seems making up her packages; she sails weeping through
 her gilt boudoirs, as if taking leave. D’Aiguilon and Company are
 near their last card; nevertheless they will not yet throw up the
 game. But as for the sacramental controversy, it is as good as
 settled without being mentioned; Louis can send for his Abbé
 Moudon in the course of next night, be confessed by him, some say
 for the space of “seventeen minutes,” and demand the sacraments
 of his own accord. Nay, already, in the afternoon, behold is not this your Sorceress
 Dubarry with the handkerchief at her eyes, mounting D’Aiguillon’s
 chariot; rolling off in his Duchess’s consolatory arms? She is
 gone; and her place knows her no more. Vanish, false Sorceress;
 into Space! Needless to hover at neighbouring Ruel; for thy day
 is done. Shut are the royal palace-gates for evermore; hardly in
 coming years shalt thou, under cloud of night, descend once, in
 black domino, like a black night-bird, and disturb the fair
 Antoinette’s music-party in the Park: all Birds of Paradise
 flying from thee, and musical windpipes growing mute.[18] Thou
 unclean, yet unmalignant, not unpitiable thing! What a course was
 thine: from that first trucklebed (in Joan of Arc’s country)
 where thy mother bore thee, with tears, to an unnamed father:
 forward, through lowest subterranean depths, and over highest
 sunlit heights, of Harlotdom and Rascaldom—to the guillotine-axe,
 which shears away thy vainly whimpering head! Rest there
 uncursed; only buried and abolished: what else befitted thee? Louis, meanwhile, is in considerable impatience for his
 sacraments; sends more than once to the window, to see whether
 they are not coming. Be of comfort, Louis, what comfort thou
 canst: they are under way, those sacraments. Towards six in the
 morning, they arrive. Cardinal Grand-Almoner Roche-Aymon is here,
 in pontificals, with his pyxes and his tools; he approaches the
 royal pillow; elevates his wafer; mutters or seems to mutter
 somewhat;—and so (as the Abbé Georgel, in words that stick to
 one, expresses it) has Louis “made the _amende honorable_ to
 God;” so does your Jesuit construe it.—‘_Wa, Wa_,’ as the wild
 Clotaire groaned out, when life was departing, ‘what great God is
 this that pulls down the strength of the strongest kings!’[19] The _amende honorable_, what “legal apology” you will, to
 God:—but not, if D’Aiguillon can help it, to man. Dubarry still
 hovers in his mansion at Ruel; and while there is life, there is
 hope. Grand-Almoner Roche-Aymon, accordingly (for he seems to be
 in the secret), has no sooner seen his pyxes and gear repacked,
 then he is stepping majestically forth again, as if the work were
 done! But King’s Confessor Abbé Moudon starts forward; with
 anxious acidulent face, twitches him by the sleeve; whispers in
 his ear. Whereupon the poor Cardinal must turn round; and declare
 audibly; ‘That his Majesty repents of any subjects of scandal he
 may have given (_a pu donner_); and purposes, by the strength of
 Heaven assisting him, to avoid the like—for the future!’ Words
 listened to by Richelieu with mastiff-face, growing blacker;
 answered to, aloud, “with an epithet,”—which Besenval will not
 repeat. Old Richelieu, conqueror of Minorca, companion of
 Flying-Table orgies, perforator of bedroom walls,[20] is thy day
 also done? Alas, the Chapel organs may keep going; the Shrine of Sainte
 Genevieve be let down, and pulled up again,—without effect. In
 the evening the whole Court, with Dauphin and Dauphiness, assist
 at the Chapel: priests are hoarse with chanting their “Prayers of
 Forty Hours;” and the heaving bellows blow. Almost frightful! For
 the very heaven blackens; battering rain-torrents dash, with
 thunder; almost drowning the organ’s voice: and electric
 fire-flashes make the very flambeaux on the altar pale. So that
 the most, as we are told, retired, when it was over, with hurried
 steps, “in a state of meditation (_recueillement_),” and said
 little or nothing.[21] So it has lasted for the better half of a fortnight; the Dubarry
 gone almost a week. Besenval says, all the world was getting
 impatient _que cela finît;_ that poor Louis would have done with
 it. It is now the 10th of May 1774. He will soon have done now. This tenth May day falls into the loathsome sick-bed; but dull,
 unnoticed there: for they that look out of the windows are quite
 darkened; the cistern-wheel moves discordant on its axis; Life,
 like a spent steed, is panting towards the goal. In their remote
 apartments, Dauphin and Dauphiness stand road-ready; all grooms
 and equerries booted and spurred: waiting for some signal to
 escape the house of pestilence.[22] And, hark! across the
 Œil-de-Bœuf, what sound is that; sound “terrible and absolutely
 like thunder”? It is the rush of the whole Court, rushing as in
 wager, to salute the new Sovereigns: Hail to your Majesties! The
 Dauphin and Dauphiness are King and Queen! Over-powered with many
 emotions, they two fall on their knees together, and, with
 streaming tears, exclaim, ‘O God, guide us, protect us; we are
 too young to reign!’—Too young indeed. Thus, in any case, “with a sound absolutely like thunder,” has
 the Horologe of Time struck, and an old Era passed away. The
 Louis that was, lies forsaken, a mass of abhorred clay; abandoned
 “to some poor persons, and priests of the _Chapelle
 Ardente_,”—who make haste to put him “in two lead coffins,
 pouring in abundant spirits of wine.” The new Louis with his
 Court is rolling towards Choisy, through the summer afternoon:
 the royal tears still flow; but a word mispronounced by
 Monseigneur d’Artois sets them all laughing, and they weep no
 more. Light mortals, how ye walk your light life-minuet, over
 bottomless abysses, divided from you by a film! For the rest, the proper authorities felt that no Funeral could
 be too unceremonious. Besenval himself thinks it was
 unceremonious enough. Two carriages containing two noblemen of
 the usher species, and a Versailles clerical person; some score
 of mounted pages, some fifty palfreniers; these, with torches,
 but not so much as in black, start from Versailles on the second
 evening with their leaden bier. At a high trot they start; and
 keep up that pace. For the jibes (_brocards_) of those Parisians,
 who stand planted in two rows, all the way to St. Denis, and
 “give vent to their pleasantry, the characteristic of the
 nation,” do not tempt one to slacken. Towards midnight the vaults
 of St. Denis receive their own; unwept by any eye of all these;
 if not by poor _Loque_ his neglected Daughter’s, whose Nunnery is
 hard by. Him they crush down, and huddle under-ground, in this impatient
 way; him and his era of sin and tyranny and shame; for behold a
 New Era is come; the future all the brighter that the past was
 base.
 BOOK 1.II.
 THE PAPER AGE
 Chapter 1.2.I.
 Astræa Redux. A paradoxical philosopher, carrying to the uttermost length that
 aphorism of Montesquieu’s, “Happy the people whose annals are
 tiresome,” has said, “Happy the people whose annals are vacant.”
 In which saying, mad as it looks, may there not still be found
 some grain of reason? For truly, as it has been written, “Silence
 is divine,” and of Heaven; so in all earthly things too there is
 a silence which is better than any speech. Consider it well, the
 Event, the thing which can be spoken of and recorded, is it not,
 in all cases, some disruption, some solution of continuity? Were
 it even a glad Event, it involves change, involves loss (of
 active Force); and so far, either in the past or in the present,
 is an irregularity, a disease. Stillest perseverance were our
 blessedness; not dislocation and alteration,—could they be
 avoided. The oak grows silently, in the forest, a thousand years; only in
 the thousandth year, when the woodman arrives with his axe, is
 there heard an echoing through the solitudes; and the oak
 announces itself when, with a far-sounding crash, it _falls_. How
 silent too was the planting of the acorn; scattered from the lap
 of some wandering wind! Nay, when our oak flowered, or put on its
 leaves (its glad Events), what shout of proclamation could there
 be? Hardly from the most observant a word of recognition. These
 things _befell_ not, they were slowly _done;_ not in an hour, but
 through the flight of days: what was to be said of it? This hour
 seemed altogether as the last was, as the next would be.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' It is thus everywhere that foolish Rumour babbles not of what was
 done, but of what was misdone or undone; and foolish History
 (ever, more or less, the written epitomised synopsis of Rumour)
 knows so little that were not as well unknown. Attila Invasions,
 Walter-the-Penniless Crusades, Sicilian Vespers, Thirty-Years
 Wars: mere sin and misery; not work, but hindrance of work! For
 the Earth, all this while, was yearly green and yellow with her
 kind harvests; the hand of the craftsman, the mind of the thinker
 rested not: and so, after all, and in spite of all, we have this
 so glorious high-domed blossoming World; concerning which, poor
 History may well ask, with wonder, Whence _it_ came? She knows so
 little of it, knows so much of what obstructed it, what would
 have rendered it impossible. Such, nevertheless, by necessity or
 foolish choice, is her rule and practice; whereby that paradox,
 “Happy the people whose annals are vacant,” is not without its
 true side. And yet, what seems more pertinent to note here, there is a
 stillness, not of unobstructed growth, but of passive inertness,
 and symptom of imminent downfall. As victory is silent, so is
 defeat. Of the opposing forces the weaker has resigned itself;
 the stronger marches on, noiseless now, but rapid, inevitable:
 the fall and overturn will not be noiseless. How all grows, and
 has its period, even as the herbs of the fields, be it annual,
 centennial, millennial! All grows and dies, each by its own
 wondrous laws, in wondrous fashion of its own; spiritual things
 most wondrously of all. Inscrutable, to the wisest, are these
 latter; not to be prophesied of, or understood. If when the oak
 stands proudliest flourishing to the eye, you know that its heart
 is sound, it is not so with the man; how much less with the
 Society, with the Nation of men! Of such it may be affirmed even
 that the superficial aspect, that the inward feeling of full
 health, is generally ominous. For indeed it is of apoplexy, so to
 speak, and a plethoric lazy habit of body, that Churches,
 Kingships, Social Institutions, oftenest die. Sad, when such
 Institution plethorically says to itself, Take thy ease, thou
 hast goods laid up;—like the fool of the Gospel, to whom it was
 answered, Fool, _this night_ thy life shall be required of thee! Is it the healthy peace, or the ominous unhealthy, that rests on
 France, for these next Ten Years? Over which the Historian can
 pass lightly, without call to linger: for as yet events are not,
 much less performances. Time of sunniest stillness;—shall we call
 it, what all men thought it, the new Age of Gold? Call it at
 least, of Paper; which in many ways is the succedaneum of Gold.
 Bank-paper, wherewith you can still buy when there is no gold
 left; Book-paper, splendent with Theories, Philosophies,
 Sensibilities,—beautiful art, not only of revealing Thought, but
 also of so beautifully hiding from us the want of Thought! Paper
 is made from the _rags_ of things that did once exist; there are
 endless excellences in Paper.—What wisest Philosophe, in this
 halcyon uneventful period, could prophesy that there was
 approaching, big with darkness and confusion, the event of
 events? Hope ushers in a Revolution,—as earthquakes are preceded
 by bright weather. On the Fifth of May, fifteen years hence, old
 Louis will not be sending for the Sacraments; but a new Louis,
 his grandson, with the whole pomp of astonished intoxicated
 France, will be opening the States-General. Dubarrydom and its D’Aiguillons are gone forever. There is a
 young, still docile, well-intentioned King; a young, beautiful
 and bountiful, well-intentioned Queen; and with them all France,
 as it were, become young. Maupeou and his Parlement have to
 vanish into thick night; respectable Magistrates, not indifferent
 to the Nation, were it only for having been opponents of the
 Court, can descend unchained from their “steep rocks at Croe in
 Combrailles” and elsewhere, and return singing praises: the old
 Parlement of Paris resumes its functions. Instead of a profligate
 bankrupt Abbé Terray, we have now, for Controller-General, a
 virtuous philosophic Turgot, with a whole Reformed France in his
 head. By whom whatsoever is wrong, in Finance or otherwise, will
 be righted,—as far as possible. Is it not as if Wisdom herself
 were henceforth to have seat and voice in the Council of Kings?
 Turgot has taken office with the noblest plainness of speech to
 that effect; been listened to with the noblest royal
 trustfulness.[23] It is true, as King Louis objects, ‘They say he
 never goes to mass;’ but liberal France likes him little worse
 for that; liberal France answers, ‘The Abbé Terray always went.’
 Philosophism sees, for the first time, a Philosophe (or even a
 Philosopher) in office: she in all things will applausively
 second him; neither will light old Maurepas obstruct, if he can
 easily help it. Then how “sweet” are the manners; vice “losing all its
 deformity;” becoming _decent_ (as established things, making
 regulations for themselves, do); becoming almost a kind of
 “sweet” virtue! Intelligence so abounds; irradiated by wit and
 the art of conversation. Philosophism sits joyful in her
 glittering saloons, the dinner-guest of Opulence grown ingenuous,
 the very nobles proud to sit by her; and preaches, lifted up over
 all Bastilles, a coming millennium. From far Ferney, Patriarch
 Voltaire gives sign: veterans Diderot, D’Alembert have lived to
 see this day; these with their younger Marmontels, Morellets,
 Chamforts, Raynals, make glad the spicy board of rich ministering
 Dowager, of philosophic Farmer-General. O nights and suppers of
 the gods! Of a truth, the long-demonstrated will now be done:
 “the Age of Revolutions approaches” (as Jean Jacques wrote), but
 then of happy blessed ones. Man awakens from his long
 somnambulism; chases the Phantasms that beleagured and bewitched
 him. Behold the new morning glittering down the eastern steeps;
 fly, false Phantasms, from its shafts of light; let the Absurd
 fly utterly forsaking this lower Earth for ever. It is Truth and
 _Astræa Redux_ that (in the shape of Philosophism) henceforth
 reign. For what imaginable purpose was man made, if not to be
 “happy”? By victorious Analysis, and Progress of the Species,
 happiness enough now awaits him. Kings can become philosophers;
 or else philosophers Kings. Let but Society be once rightly
 constituted,—by victorious Analysis. The stomach that is empty
 shall be filled; the throat that is dry shall be wetted with
 wine. Labour itself shall be all one as rest; not grievous, but
 joyous. Wheatfields, one would think, cannot come to grow
 untilled; no man made clayey, or made weary thereby;—unless
 indeed machinery will do it? Gratuitous Tailors and Restaurateurs
 may start up, at fit intervals, one as yet sees not how. But if
 each will, according to rule of Benevolence, have a care for all,
 then surely—no one will be uncared for. Nay, who knows but, by
 sufficiently victorious Analysis, “human life may be indefinitely
 lengthened,” and men get rid of Death, as they have already done
 of the Devil? We shall then be happy in spite of Death and the
 Devil.—So preaches magniloquent Philosophism her _Redeunt
 Saturnia regna._ The prophetic song of Paris and its Philosophes is audible enough
 in the Versailles Œil-de-Bœuf; and the Œil-de-Bœuf, intent
 chiefly on nearer blessedness, can answer, at worst, with a
 polite ‘Why not?’ Good old cheery Maurepas is too joyful a Prime
 Minister to dash the world’s joy. Sufficient for the day be its
 own evil. Cheery old man, he cuts his jokes, and hovers careless
 along; his cloak well adjusted to the wind, if so be he may
 please all persons. The simple young King, whom a Maurepas cannot
 think of troubling with business, has retired into the interior
 apartments; taciturn, irresolute; though with a sharpness of
 temper at times: he, at length, determines on a little smithwork;
 and so, in apprenticeship with a Sieur Gamain (whom one day he
 shall have little cause to bless), is learning to make locks.[24]
 It appears further, he understood Geography; and could read
 English. Unhappy young King, his childlike trust in that foolish
 old Maurepas deserved another return. But friend and foe, destiny
 and himself have combined to do him hurt. Meanwhile the fair young Queen, in her halls of state, walks like
 a goddess of Beauty, the cynosure of all eyes; as yet mingles not
 with affairs; heeds not the future; least of all, dreads it.
 Weber and Campan[25] have pictured her, there within the royal
 tapestries, in bright boudoirs, baths, peignoirs, and the Grand
 and Little Toilette; with a whole brilliant world waiting
 obsequious on her glance: fair young daughter of Time, what
 things has Time in store for thee! Like Earth’s brightest
 Appearance, she moves gracefully, environed with the grandeur of
 Earth: a reality, and yet a magic vision; for, behold, shall not
 utter Darkness swallow it! The soft young heart adopts orphans,
 portions meritorious maids, delights to succour the poor,—such
 poor as come picturesquely in her way; and sets the fashion of
 doing it; for as was said, Benevolence has now begun reigning. In
 her Duchess de Polignac, in Princess de Lamballe, she enjoys
 something almost like friendship; now too, after seven long
 years, she has a child, and soon even a Dauphin, of her own; can
 reckon herself, as Queens go, happy in a husband. Events? The Grand events are but charitable Feasts of Morals
 (_Fêtes des mœurs_), with their Prizes and Speeches; Poissarde
 Processions to the Dauphin’s cradle; above all, Flirtations,
 their rise, progress, decline and fall. There are Snow-statues
 raised by the poor in hard winter to a Queen who has given them
 fuel. There are masquerades, theatricals; beautifyings of little
 Trianon, purchase and repair of St. Cloud; journeyings from the
 summer Court-Elysium to the winter one. There are poutings and
 grudgings from the Sardinian Sisters-in-law (for the Princes too
 are wedded); little jealousies, which Court-Etiquette can
 moderate. Wholly the lightest-hearted frivolous foam of
 Existence; yet an artfully refined foam; pleasant were it not so
 costly, like that which mantles on the wine of Champagne! Monsieur, the King’s elder Brother, has set up for a kind of wit;
 and leans towards the Philosophe side. Monseigneur d’Artois pulls
 the mask from a fair impertinent; fights a duel in
 consequence,—almost drawing blood.[26] He has breeches of a kind
 new in this world;—a fabulous kind; “four tall lackeys,” says
 Mercier, as if he had seen it, “hold him up in the air, that he
 may fall into the garment without vestige of wrinkle; from which
 rigorous encasement the same four, in the same way, and with more
 effort, must deliver him at night.”[27] This last is he who now,
 as a gray time-worn man, sits desolate at Grätz;[28] having
 winded up his destiny with the Three Days. In such sort are poor
 mortals swept and shovelled to and fro.
 Chapter 1.2.II.
 Petition in Hieroglyphs. With the working people, again it is not so well. Unlucky! For
 there are twenty to twenty-five millions of them. Whom, however,
 we lump together into a kind of dim compendious unity, monstrous
 but dim, far off, as the _canaille;_ or, more humanely, as “the
 masses.” Masses, indeed: and yet, singular to say, if, with an
 effort of imagination, thou follow them, over broad France, into
 their clay hovels, into their garrets and hutches, the masses
 consist all of units. Every unit of whom has his own heart and
 sorrows; stands covered there with his own skin, and if you prick
 him he will bleed. O purple Sovereignty, Holiness, Reverence;
 thou, for example, Cardinal Grand-Almoner, with thy plush
 covering of honour, who hast thy hands strengthened with
 dignities and moneys, and art set on thy world watch-tower
 solemnly, in sight of God, for such ends,—what a thought: that
 every unit of these masses is a miraculous Man, even as thyself
 art; struggling, with vision, or with blindness, for _his_
 infinite Kingdom (this life which he has got, once only, in the
 middle of Eternities); with a spark of the Divinity, what thou
 callest an immortal soul, in him! Dreary, languid do these struggle in their obscure remoteness;
 their hearth cheerless, their diet thin. For them, in this world,
 rises no Era of Hope; hardly now in the other,—if it be not hope
 in the gloomy rest of Death, for their faith too is failing.
 Untaught, uncomforted, unfed! A dumb generation; their voice only
 an inarticulate cry: spokesman, in the King’s Council, in the
 world’s forum, they have none that finds credence. At rare
 intervals (as now, in 1775), they will fling down their hoes and
 hammers; and, to the astonishment of thinking mankind,[29] flock
 hither and thither, dangerous, aimless; get the length even of
 Versailles. Turgot is altering the Corn-trade, abrogating the
 absurdest Corn-laws; there is dearth, real, or were it even
 “factitious;” an indubitable scarcity of bread. And so, on the
 second day of May 1775, these waste multitudes do here, at
 Versailles Château, in wide-spread wretchedness, in sallow faces,
 squalor, winged raggedness, present, as in legible hieroglyphic
 writing, their Petition of Grievances. The Château gates have to
 be shut; but the King will appear on the balcony, and speak to
 them. They have seen the King’s face; their Petition of
 Grievances has been, if not read, looked at. For answer, two of
 them are hanged, on a “new gallows forty feet high;” and the rest
 driven back to their dens,—for a time. Clearly a difficult “point” for Government, that of dealing with
 these masses;—if indeed it be not rather the sole point and
 problem of Government, and all other points mere accidental
 crotchets, superficialities, and beatings of the wind! For let
 Charter-Chests, Use and Wont, Law common and special say what
 they will, the masses count to so many millions of units; made,
 to all appearance, by God,—whose Earth this is declared to be.
 Besides, the people are not without ferocity; they have sinews
 and indignation. Do but look what holiday old Marquis Mirabeau,
 the crabbed old friend of Men, looked on, in these same years,
 from his lodging, at the Baths of Mont d’Or: “The savages
 descending in torrents from the mountains; our people ordered not
 to go out. The Curate in surplice and stole; Justice in its
 peruke; Marechausee sabre in hand, guarding the place, till the
 bagpipes can begin. The dance interrupted, in a quarter of an
 hour, by battle; the cries, the squealings of children, of infirm
 persons, and other assistants, tarring them on, as the rabble
 does when dogs fight: frightful men, or rather frightful wild
 animals, clad in jupes of coarse woollen, with large girdles of
 leather studded with copper nails; of gigantic stature,
 heightened by high wooden-clogs (_sabots_); rising on tiptoe to
 see the fight; tramping time to it; rubbing their sides with
 their elbows: their faces haggard (_figures hâves_), and covered
 with their long greasy hair; the upper part of the visage waxing
 pale, the lower distorting itself into the attempt at a cruel
 laugh and a sort of ferocious impatience. And these people pay
 the _taille!_ And you want further to take their salt from them!
 And you know not what it is you are stripping barer, or as you
 call it, governing; what by the spurt of your pen, in its cold
 dastard indifference, you will fancy you can starve always with
 impunity; always till the catastrophe come!—Ah Madame, such
 Government by Blindman’s-buff, stumbling along too far, will end
 in the General Overturn (_culbute générale_).”[30] Undoubtedly a dark feature this in an Age of Gold,—Age, at least,
 of Paper and Hope! Meanwhile, trouble us not with thy prophecies,
 O croaking Friend of Men: ’tis long that we have heard such; and
 still the old world keeps wagging, in its old way.
 Chapter 1.2.III.
 Questionable. Or is this same Age of Hope itself but a simulacrum; as Hope too
 often is? Cloud-vapour with rainbows painted on it, beautiful to
 see, to sail towards,—which hovers over Niagara Falls? In that
 case, victorious Analysis will have enough to do. Alas, yes! a whole world to remake, if she could see it; work for
 another than she! For all is wrong, and gone out of joint; the
 inward spiritual, and the outward economical; head or heart,
 there is no soundness in it. As indeed, evils of all sorts are
 more or less of kin, and do usually go together: especially it is
 an old truth, that wherever huge physical evil is, there, as the
 parent and origin of it, has moral evil to a proportionate extent
 been. Before those five-and-twenty labouring Millions, for
 instance, could get that haggardness of face, which old Mirabeau
 now looks on, in a Nation calling itself Christian, and calling
 man the brother of man,—what unspeakable, nigh infinite
 Dishonesty (of _seeming_ and not _being_) in all manner of
 Rulers, and appointed Watchers, spiritual and temporal, must
 there not, through long ages, have gone on accumulating! It will
 accumulate: moreover, it will reach a head; for the first of all
 Gospels is this, that a Lie cannot endure for ever. In fact, if we pierce through that rosepink vapour of
 Sentimentalism, Philanthropy, and Feasts of Morals, there lies
 behind it one of the sorriest spectacles. You might ask, What
 bonds that ever held a human society happily together, or held it
 together at all, are in force here? It is an unbelieving people;
 which has suppositions, hypotheses, and froth-systems of
 victorious Analysis; and for _belief_ this mainly, that Pleasure
 is pleasant. Hunger they have for all sweet things; and the law
 of Hunger; but what other law? Within them, or over them,
 properly none! Their King has become a King Popinjay; with his Maurepas
 Government, gyrating as the weather-cock does, blown about by
 every wind. Above them they see no God; or they even do not look
 above, except with astronomical glasses. The Church indeed still
 is; but in the most submissive state; quite tamed by
 Philosophism; in a singularly short time; for the hour was come.
 Some twenty years ago, your Archbishop Beaumont would not even
 let the poor Jansenists get buried: your Loménie Brienne (a
 rising man, whom we shall meet with yet) could, in the name of
 the Clergy, insist on having the Anti-protestant laws, which
 condemn to death for preaching, “put in execution.”[31] And,
 alas, now not so much as Baron Holbach’s Atheism can be
 burnt,—except as pipe-matches by the private speculative
 individual. Our Church stands haltered, dumb, like a dumb ox;
 lowing only for provender (of tithes); content if it can have
 that; or, dumbly, dully expecting its further doom. And the
 Twenty Millions of “haggard faces;” and, as finger-post and
 guidance to them in their dark struggle, “a gallows forty feet
 high”! Certainly a singular Golden Age; with its Feasts of
 Morals, its “sweet manners,” its sweet institutions
 (_institutions douces_); betokening nothing but peace among
 men!—Peace? O Philosophe-Sentimentalism, what hast thou to do
 with peace, when thy mother’s name is Jezebel? Foul Product of
 still fouler Corruption, thou with the corruption art doomed! Meanwhile it is singular how long the rotten will hold together,
 provided you do not handle it roughly. For whole generations it
 continues standing, “with a ghastly affectation of life,” after
 all life and truth has fled out of it; so loth are men to quit
 their old ways; and, conquering indolence and inertia, venture on
 new. Great truly is the Actual; is the Thing that has rescued
 itself from bottomless deeps of theory and possibility, and
 stands there as a definite indisputable Fact, whereby men do work
 and live, or once did so. Widely shall men cleave to that, while
 it will endure; and quit it with regret, when it gives way under
 them. Rash enthusiast of Change, beware! Hast thou well
 considered all that Habit does in this life of ours; how all
 Knowledge and all Practice hang wondrous over infinite abysses of
 the Unknown, Impracticable; and our whole being is an infinite
 abyss, _overarched_ by Habit, as by a thin Earth-rind,
 laboriously built together? But if “every man,” as it has been written, “holds confined
 within him a _mad_-man,” what must every Society do;—Society,
 which in its commonest state is called “the standing miracle of
 this world”! “Without such Earth-rind of Habit,” continues our
 author, “call it System of Habits, in a word, _fixed ways_ of
 acting and of believing,—Society would not exist at all. With
 such it exists, better or worse. Herein too, in this its System
 of Habits, acquired, retained how you will, lies the true
 Law-Code and Constitution of a Society; the only Code, though an
 unwritten one which it can in nowise _dis_obey. The thing we call
 written Code, Constitution, Form of Government, and the like,
 what is it but some miniature image, and solemnly expressed
 summary of this unwritten Code? _Is_,—or rather alas, is _not;_
 but only should be, and always tends to be! In which latter
 discrepancy lies struggle without end.” And now, we add in the
 same dialect, let but, by ill chance, in such ever-enduring
 struggle,—your “thin Earth-rind” be once _broken!_ The fountains
 of the great deep boil forth; fire-fountains, enveloping,
 engulfing. Your “Earth-rind” is shattered, swallowed up; instead
 of a green flowery world, there is a waste wild-weltering
 chaos:—which has again, with tumult and struggle, to _make_
 itself into a world. On the other hand, be this conceded: Where thou findest a Lie
 that is oppressing thee, extinguish it. Lies exist there only to
 be extinguished; they wait and cry earnestly for extinction.
 Think well, meanwhile, in what spirit thou wilt do it: not with
 hatred, with headlong selfish violence; but in clearness of
 heart, with holy zeal, gently, almost with pity. Thou wouldst not
 _replace_ such extinct Lie by a new Lie, which a new Injustice of
 thy own were; the parent of still other Lies? Whereby the latter
 end of that business were worse than the beginning. So, however, in this world of ours, which has both an
 indestructible hope in the Future, and an indestructible tendency
 to persevere as in the Past, must Innovation and Conservation
 wage their perpetual conflict, as they may and can. Wherein the
 “dæmonic element,” that lurks in all human things, _may_
 doubtless, some once in the thousand years—get vent! But indeed
 may we not regret that such conflict,—which, after all, is but
 like that classical one of “hate-filled Amazons with heroic
 Youths,” and will end in _embraces_,—should usually be so
 spasmodic? For Conservation, strengthened by that mightiest
 quality in us, our indolence, sits for long ages, not victorious
 only, which she should be; but tyrannical, incommunicative. She
 holds her adversary as if annihilated; such adversary lying, all
 the while, like some buried Enceladus; who, to gain the smallest
 freedom, must stir a whole Trinacria with it Ætnas. Wherefore, on the whole, we will honour a Paper Age too; an Era
 of hope! For in this same frightful process of Enceladus Revolt;
 when the task, on which no mortal would willingly enter, has
 become imperative, inevitable,—is it not even a kindness of
 Nature that she lures us forward by cheerful promises, fallacious
 or not; and a whole generation plunges into the Erebus Blackness,
 lighted on by an Era of Hope? It has been well said: “Man is
 based on Hope; he has properly no other possession but Hope; this
 habitation of his is named the Place of Hope.”
 Chapter 1.2.IV.
 Maurepas. But now, among French hopes, is not that of old M. de Maurepas
 one of the best-grounded; who hopes that he, by dexterity, shall
 contrive to continue Minister? Nimble old man, who for all
 emergencies has his light jest; and ever in the worst confusion
 will emerge, cork-like, unsunk! Small care to him is
 Perfectibility, Progress of the Species, and _Astræa Redux:_ good
 only, that a man of light wit, verging towards fourscore, can in
 the seat of authority feel himself important among men. Shall we
 call him, as haughty Châteauroux was wont of old, “_M. Faquinet_
 (Diminutive of Scoundrel)”? In courtier dialect, he is now named
 “the Nestor of France;” such governing Nestor as France has. At bottom, nevertheless, it might puzzle one to say where the
 Government of France, in these days, specially is. In that
 Château of Versailles, we have Nestor, King, Queen, ministers and
 clerks, with paper-bundles tied in tape: but the Government? For
 Government is a thing that _governs_, that guides; and if need
 be, compels. Visible in France there is not such a thing.
 Invisible, inorganic, on the other hand, there is: in Philosophe
 saloons, in Œil-de-Bœuf galleries; in the tongue of the babbler,
 in the pen of the pamphleteer. Her Majesty appearing at the Opera
 is applauded; she returns all radiant with joy. Anon the
 applauses wax fainter, or threaten to cease; she is heavy of
 heart, the light of her face has fled. Is Sovereignty some poor
 Montgolfier; which, blown into by the popular wind, grows great
 and mounts; or sinks flaccid, if the wind be withdrawn? France
 was long a “Despotism tempered by Epigrams;” and now, it would
 seem, the Epigrams have get the upper hand. Happy were a young “Louis the Desired” to make France happy; if
 it did not prove too troublesome, and he only knew the way. But
 there is endless discrepancy round him; so many claims and
 clamours; a mere confusion of tongues. Not reconcilable by man;
 not manageable, suppressible, save by some strongest and wisest
 men;—which only a lightly-jesting lightly-gyrating M. de Maurepas
 can so much as subsist amidst. Philosophism claims her new Era,
 meaning thereby innumerable things. And claims it in no faint
 voice; for France at large, hitherto mute, is now beginning to
 speak also; and speaks in that same sense. A huge, many-toned
 sound; distant, yet not unimpressive. On the other hand, the
 Œil-de-Bœuf, which, as nearest, one can hear best, claims with
 shrill vehemence that the Monarchy be as heretofore a Horn of
 Plenty; wherefrom loyal courtiers may draw,—to the just support
 of the throne. Let Liberalism and a New Era, if such is the wish,
 be introduced; only no curtailment of the royal moneys? Which
 latter condition, alas, is precisely the impossible one. Philosophism, as we saw, has got her Turgot made
 Controller-General; and there shall be endless reformation.
 Unhappily this Turgot could continue only twenty months. With a
 miraculous _Fortunatus’ Purse_ in his Treasury, it might have
 lasted longer; with such Purse indeed, every French
 Controller-General, that would prosper in these days, ought first
 to provide himself. But here again may we not remark the bounty
 of Nature in regard to Hope? Man after man advances confident to
 the Augean Stable, as if _he_ could clean it; expends his little
 fraction of an ability on it, with such cheerfulness; does, in so
 far as he was honest, accomplish something. Turgot has faculties;
 honesty, insight, heroic volition; but the Fortunatus’ Purse he
 has not. Sanguine Controller-General! a whole pacific French
 Revolution may stand schemed in the head of the thinker; but who
 shall pay the unspeakable “indemnities” that will be needed?
 Alas, far from that: on the very threshold of the business, he
 proposes that the Clergy, the Noblesse, the very Parlements be
 subjected to taxes! One shriek of indignation and astonishment
 reverberates through all the Château galleries; M. de Maurepas
 has to gyrate: the poor King, who had written few weeks ago, “_Il
 n’y a que vous et moi qui aimions le peuple_ (There is none but
 you and I that has the people’s interest at heart),” must write
 now a dismissal;[32] and let the French Revolution accomplish
 itself, pacifically or not, as it can. Hope, then, is deferred? Deferred; not destroyed, or abated. Is
 not this, for example, our Patriarch Voltaire, after long years
 of absence, revisiting Paris? With face shrivelled to nothing;
 with “huge peruke _à la Louis Quatorze_, which leaves only two
 eyes ‘visible’ glittering like carbuncles,” the old man is
 here.[33] What an outburst! Sneering Paris has suddenly grown
 reverent; devotional with Hero-worship. Nobles have disguised
 themselves as tavern-waiters to obtain sight of him: the
 loveliest of France would lay their hair beneath his feet. “His
 chariot is the nucleus of a comet; whose train fills whole
 streets:” they crown him in the theatre, with immortal vivats;
 “finally stifle him under roses,”—for old Richelieu recommended
 opium in such state of the nerves, and the excessive Patriarch
 took too much. Her Majesty herself had some thought of sending
 for him; but was dissuaded. Let Majesty consider it,
 nevertheless. The purport of this man’s existence has been to
 wither up and annihilate all whereon Majesty and Worship for the
 present rests: and is it _so_ that the world recognises him? With
 Apotheosis; as its Prophet and Speaker, who has spoken wisely the
 thing it longed to say? Add only, that the body of this same
 rose-stifled, beatified-Patriarch cannot get buried except by
 stealth. It is wholly a notable business; and France, without
 doubt, is _big_ (what the Germans call “Of good Hope”): we shall
 wish her a happy birth-hour, and blessed fruit.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Beaumarchais too has now winded-up his Law-Pleadings
 (_Mémoires_);[34] not without result, to himself and to the
 world. Caron Beaumarchais (or de Beaumarchais, for he got
 ennobled) had been born poor, but aspiring, esurient; with
 talents, audacity, adroitness; above all, with the talent for
 intrigue: a lean, but also a tough, indomitable man. Fortune and
 dexterity brought him to the harpsichord of Mesdames, our good
 Princesses _Loque, Graille_ and Sisterhood. Still better, Paris
 Duvernier, the Court-Banker, honoured him with some confidence;
 to the length even of transactions in cash. Which confidence,
 however, Duvernier’s Heir, a person of quality, would not
 continue. Quite otherwise; there springs a Lawsuit from it:
 wherein tough Beaumarchais, losing both money and repute, is, in
 the opinion of Judge-Reporter Goezman, of the Parlement Maupeou,
 of a whole indifferent acquiescing world, miserably beaten. In
 all men’s opinions, only not in his own! Inspired by the
 indignation, which makes, if not verses, satirical law-papers,
 the withered Music-master, with a desperate heroism, takes up his
 lost cause in spite of the world; fights for it, against
 Reporters, Parlements and Principalities, with light banter, with
 clear logic; adroitly, with an inexhaustible toughness and
 resource, like the skilfullest fencer; on whom, so skilful is he,
 the whole world now looks. Three long years it lasts; with
 wavering fortune. In fine, after labours comparable to the Twelve
 of Hercules, our unconquerable Caron triumphs; regains his
 Lawsuit and Lawsuits; strips Reporter Goezman of the judicial
 ermine; covering him with a perpetual garment of obloquy
 instead:—and in regard to the Parlement Maupeou (which he has
 helped to extinguish), to Parlements of all kinds, and to French
 Justice generally, gives rise to endless reflections in the minds
 of men. Thus has Beaumarchais, like a lean French Hercules,
 ventured down, driven by destiny, into the Nether Kingdoms; and
 victoriously tamed hell-dogs there. He also is henceforth among
 the notabilities of his generation.
 Chapter 1.2.V.
 Astræa Redux without Cash. Observe, however, beyond the Atlantic, has not the new day verily
 dawned! Democracy, as we said, is born; storm-girt, is struggling
 for life and victory. A sympathetic France rejoices over the
 Rights of Man; in all saloons, it is said, What a spectacle! Now
 too behold our Deane, our Franklin, American Plenipotentiaries,
 here in position soliciting;[35] the sons of the Saxon Puritans,
 with their Old-Saxon temper, Old-Hebrew culture, sleek Silas,
 sleek Benjamin, here on such errand, among the light children of
 Heathenism, Monarchy, Sentimentalism, and the Scarlet-woman. A
 spectacle indeed; over which saloons may cackle joyous; though
 Kaiser Joseph, questioned on it, gave this answer, most
 unexpected from a Philosophe: ‘Madame, the trade I live by is
 that of royalist (_Mon métier à moi c’est d’être royaliste_).’ So thinks light Maurepas too; but the wind of Philosophism and
 force of public opinion will blow him round. Best wishes,
 meanwhile, are sent; clandestine privateers armed. Paul Jones
 shall equip his _Bon Homme Richard:_ weapons, military stores can
 be smuggled over (if the English do not seize them); wherein,
 once more Beaumarchais, dimly as the Giant Smuggler becomes
 visible,—filling his own lank pocket withal. But surely, in any
 case, France should have a Navy. For which great object were not
 now the time: now when that proud Termagant of the Seas has her
 hands full? It is true, an impoverished Treasury cannot build
 ships; but the hint once given (which Beaumarchais says he gave),
 this and the other loyal Seaport, Chamber of Commerce, will build
 and offer them. Goodly vessels bound into the waters; a _Ville de
 Paris_, Leviathan of ships. And now when gratuitous three-deckers dance there at anchor, with
 streamers flying; and eleutheromaniac Philosophedom grows ever
 more clamorous, what can a Maurepas do—but gyrate? Squadrons
 cross the ocean: Gages, Lees, rough Yankee Generals, “with
 woollen night-caps under their hats,” present arms to the
 far-glancing Chivalry of France; and new-born Democracy sees, not
 without amazement, “Despotism tempered by Epigrams” fight at her
 side. So, however, it is. King’s forces and heroic volunteers;
 Rochambeaus, Bouillés, Lameths, Lafayettes, have drawn their
 swords in this sacred quarrel of mankind;—shall draw them again
 elsewhere, in the strangest way. Off Ushant some naval thunder is heard. In the course of which
 did our young Prince, Duke de Chartres, “hide in the hold;” or
 did he materially, by _active_ heroism, contribute to the
 victory? Alas, by a second edition, we learn that there was no
 victory; or that English Keppel had it.[36] Our poor young Prince
 gets his Opera plaudits changed into mocking tehees; and cannot
 become Grand-Admiral,—the source to him of woes which one may
 call endless. Woe also for _Ville de Paris_, the Leviathan of ships! English
 Rodney has clutched it, and led it home, with the rest; so
 successful was his new “manœuvre of breaking the enemy’s
 line.”[37] It seems as if, according to Louis XV., “France were
 never to have a Navy.” Brave Suffren must return from Hyder Ally
 and the Indian Waters; with small result; yet with great glory
 for “six” _non-defeats;_—which indeed, with such seconding as he
 had, one may reckon heroic. Let the old sea-hero rest now,
 honoured of France, in his native Cevennes mountains; send smoke,
 not of gunpowder, but mere culinary smoke, through the old
 chimneys of the Castle of Jalès,—which one day, in other hands,
 shall have other fame. Brave Lapérouse shall by and by lift
 anchor, on philanthropic Voyage of Discovery; for the King knows
 Geography.[38] But, alas, this also will not prosper: the brave
 Navigator goes, and returns not; the Seekers search far seas for
 him in vain. He has vanished trackless into blue Immensity; and
 only some mournful mysterious shadow of him hovers long in all
 heads and hearts. Neither, while the War yet lasts, will Gibraltar surrender. Not
 though Crillon, Nassau-Siegen, with the ablest projectors extant,
 are there; and Prince Condé and Prince d’Artois have hastened to
 help. Wondrous leather-roofed Floating-batteries, set afloat by
 French-Spanish _Pacte de Famille_, give gallant summons: to
 which, nevertheless, Gibraltar answers Plutonically, with mere
 torrents of redhot iron,—as if stone Calpe had become a throat of
 the Pit; and utters such a Doom’s-blast of a No, as all men must
 credit.[39] And so, with this loud explosion, the noise of War has ceased; an
 Age of Benevolence may hope, for ever. Our noble volunteers of
 Freedom have returned, to be her missionaries. Lafayette, as the
 matchless of his time, glitters in the Versailles Œil-de-Beouf;
 has his Bust set up in the Paris Hôtel-de-Ville. Democracy stands
 inexpugnable, immeasurable, in her New World; has even a foot
 lifted towards the Old;—and our French Finances, little
 strengthened by such work, are in no healthy way. What to do with the Finance? This indeed is the great question: a
 small but most black weather-symptom, which no radiance of
 universal hope can cover. We saw Turgot cast forth from the
 Controllership, with shrieks,—for want of a Fortunatus’ Purse. As
 little could M. de Clugny manage the duty; or indeed do anything,
 but consume his wages; attain “a place in History,” where as an
 ineffectual shadow thou beholdest him still lingering;—and let
 the duty manage itself. Did Genevese Necker _possess_ such a
 Purse, then? He possessed banker’s skill, banker’s honesty;
 _credit_ of all kinds, for he had written Academic Prize Essays,
 struggled for India Companies, given dinners to Philosophes, and
 “realised a fortune in twenty years.” He possessed, further, a
 taciturnity and solemnity; of depth, or else of dulness. How
 singular for Celadon Gibbon, false swain as he had proved; whose
 father, keeping most probably his own gig, “would not hear of
 such a union,”—to find now his forsaken Demoiselle Curchod
 sitting in the high places of the world, as Minister’s Madame,
 and “Necker not jealous!”[40] A new young Demoiselle, one day to be famed as a Madame and De
 Staël, was romping about the knees of the Decline and Fall: the
 lady Necker founds Hospitals; gives solemn Philosophe
 dinner-parties, to cheer her exhausted Controller-General.
 Strange things have happened: by clamour of Philosophism,
 management of Marquis de Pezay, and Poverty constraining even
 Kings. And so Necker, Atlas-like, sustains the burden of the
 Finances, for five years long?[41] Without wages, for he refused
 such; cheered only by Public Opinion, and the ministering of his
 noble Wife. With many thoughts in him, it is hoped;—which,
 however, he is shy of uttering. His _Compte Rendu_, published by
 the royal permission, fresh sign of a New Era, shows
 wonders;—which what but the genius of some Atlas-Necker can
 prevent from becoming portents? In Necker’s head too there is a
 whole pacific French Revolution, of its kind; and in that
 taciturn dull depth, or deep dulness, ambition enough. Meanwhile, alas, his Fotunatus’ Purse turns out to be little
 other than the old “_vectigal_ of Parsimony.” Nay, he too has to
 produce his scheme of taxing: Clergy, Noblesse to be taxed;
 Provincial Assemblies, and the rest,—like a mere Turgot! The
 expiring M. de Maurepas must gyrate one other time. Let Necker
 also depart; not unlamented. Great in a private station, Necker looks on from the distance;
 abiding his time. “Eighty thousand copies” of his new Book, which
 he calls _Administration des Finances_, will be sold in few days.
 He is gone; but shall return, and that more than once, borne by a
 whole shouting Nation. Singular Controller-General of the
 Finances; once Clerk in Thelusson’s Bank!
 Chapter 1.2.VI.
 Windbags. So marches the world, in this its Paper Age, or Era of Hope. Not
 without obstructions, war-explosions; which, however, heard from
 such distance, are little other than a cheerful marching-music.
 If indeed that dark living chaos of Ignorance and Hunger,
 five-and-twenty million strong, under your feet,—were to begin
 playing! For the present, however, consider Longchamp; now when Lent is
 ending, and the glory of Paris and France has gone forth, as in
 annual wont. Not to assist at _Tenebris_ Masses, but to sun
 itself and show itself, and salute the Young Spring.[42]
 Manifold, bright-tinted, glittering with gold; all through the
 Bois de Boulogne, in longdrawn variegated rows;—like longdrawn
 living flower-borders, tulips, dahlias, lilies of the valley; all
 in their moving flower-pots (of new-gilt carriages): pleasure of
 the eye, and pride of life! So rolls and dances the Procession:
 steady, of firm assurance, as if it rolled on adamant and the
 foundations of the world; not on mere heraldic parchment,—under
 which smoulders a lake of fire. Dance on, ye foolish ones; ye
 sought not wisdom, neither have ye found it. Ye and your fathers
 have sown the wind, ye shall reap the whirlwind. Was it not, from
 of old, written: _The wages of sin is death?_ But at Longchamp, as elsewhere, we remark for one thing, that
 dame and cavalier are waited on each by a kind of human familiar,
 named _jokei._ Little elf, or imp; though young, already
 withered; with its withered air of premature vice, of
 knowingness, of completed elf-hood: useful in various
 emergencies. The name _jokei_ (jockey) comes from the English; as
 the thing also fancies that it does. Our Anglomania, in fact , is
 grown considerable; prophetic of much. If France is to be free,
 why shall she not, now when mad war is hushed, love neighbouring
 Freedom? Cultivated men, your Dukes de Liancourt, de la
 Rochefoucault admire the English Constitution, the English
 National Character; would import what of it they can. Of what is lighter, especially if it be light as wind, how much
 easier the freightage! Non-Admiral Duke de Chartres (not yet
 d’Orléans or Egalité) flies to and fro across the Strait;
 importing English Fashions; this he, as hand-and-glove with an
 English Prince of Wales, is surely qualified to do. Carriages and
 saddles; top-boots and _rédingotes_, as we call riding-coats. Nay
 the very mode of riding: for now no man on a level with his age
 but will trot _à l’Anglaise_, rising in the stirrups; scornful of
 the old sitfast method, in which, according to Shakspeare,
 “butter and eggs” go to market. Also, he can urge the fervid
 wheels, this brave Chartres of ours; no whip in Paris is rasher
 and surer than the unprofessional one of Monseigneur. Elf _jokeis_, we have seen; but see now real Yorkshire jockeys,
 and what they ride on, and train: English racers for French
 Races. These likewise we owe first (under the Providence of the
 Devil) to Monseigneur. Prince d’Artois also has his stud of
 racers. Prince d’Artois has withal the strangest horseleech: a
 moonstruck, much-enduring individual, of Neuchâtel in
 Switzerland,—named _Jean Paul Marat_. A problematic Chevalier
 d’Eon, now in petticoats, now in breeches, is no less problematic
 in London than in Paris; and causes bets and lawsuits. Beautiful
 days of international communion! Swindlery and Blackguardism have
 stretched hands across the Channel, and saluted mutually: on the
 racecourse of Vincennes or Sablons, behold in English
 curricle-and-four, wafted glorious among the principalities and
 rascalities, an English Dr. Dodd,[43]—for whom also the too early
 gallows gapes. Duke de Chartres was a young Prince of great promise, as young
 Princes often are; which promise unfortunately has belied itself.
 With the huge Orléans Property, with Duke de Penthievre for
 Father-in-law (and now the young Brother-in-law Lamballe killed
 by excesses),—he will one day be the richest man in France.
 Meanwhile, “his hair is all falling out, his blood is quite
 spoiled,”—by early transcendentalism of debauchery. Carbuncles
 stud his face; dark studs on a ground of burnished copper. A most
 signal failure, this young Prince! The stuff prematurely burnt
 out of him: little left but foul smoke and ashes of expiring
 sensualities: what might have been Thought, Insight, and even
 Conduct, gone now, or fast going,—to confused darkness, broken by
 bewildering dazzlements; to obstreperous crotchets; to activities
 which you may call semi-delirious, or even semi-galvanic! Paris
 affects to laugh at his charioteering; but he heeds not such
 laughter. On the other hand, what a day, not of laughter, was that, when he
 threatened, for lucre’s sake, to lay sacrilegious hand on the
 Palais-Royal Garden![44] The flower-parterres shall be riven up;
 the Chestnut Avenues shall fall: time-honoured boscages, under
 which the Opera Hamadryads were wont to wander, not inexorable to
 men. Paris moans aloud. Philidor, from his Café de la Regence,
 shall no longer look on greenness; the loungers and losels of the
 world, where now shall they haunt? In vain is moaning. The axe
 glitters; the sacred groves fall crashing,—for indeed Monseigneur
 was short of money: the Opera Hamadryads fly with shrieks. Shriek
 not, ye Opera Hamadryads; or not as those that have no comfort.
 He will surround your Garden with new edifices and piazzas:
 though narrowed, it shall be replanted; dizened with hydraulic
 jets, cannon which the sun fires at noon; things bodily, things
 spiritual, such as man has not imagined;—and in the Palais-Royal
 shall again, and more than ever, be the _Sorcerer’s Sabbath_ and
 _Satan-at-Home_ of our Planet. What will not mortals attempt? From remote Annonay in the
 Vivarais, the Brothers Montgolfier send up their paper-dome,
 filled with the smoke of burnt wool.[45] The Vivarais provincial
 assembly is to be prorogued this same day: Vivarais
 Assembly-members applaud, and the shouts of congregated men. Will
 victorious Analysis scale the very Heavens, then? Paris hears with eager wonder; Paris shall ere long see. From
 Reveilion’s Paper-warehouse there, in the Rue St. Antoine (a
 noted Warehouse),—the new Montgolfier air-ship launches itself.
 Ducks and poultry are borne skyward: but now shall men be
 borne.[46] Nay, Chemist Charles thinks of hydrogen and glazed
 silk. Chemist Charles will himself ascend, from the Tuileries
 Garden; Montgolfier solemnly cutting the cord. By Heaven, he also
 mounts, he and another? Ten times ten thousand hearts go
 palpitating; all tongues are mute with wonder and fear; till a
 shout, like the voice of seas, rolls after him, on his wild way.
 He soars, he dwindles upwards; has become a mere gleaming
 circlet,—like some Turgotine snuff-box, what we call “_Turgotine
 Platitude;_” like some new daylight Moon! Finally he descends;
 welcomed by the universe. Duchess Polignac, with a party, is in
 the Bois de Boulogne, waiting; though it is drizzly winter; the
 1st of December 1783. The whole chivalry of France, Duke de
 Chartres foremost, gallops to receive him.[47] Beautiful invention; mounting heavenward, so beautifully,—so
 unguidably! Emblem of much, and of our Age of Hope itself; which
 shall mount, specifically-light, majestically in this same
 manner; and hover,—tumbling whither Fate will. Well if it do not,
 Pilatre-like, explode; and demount all the more tragically!—So,
 riding on windbags, will men scale the Empyrean. Or observe Herr Doctor Mesmer, in his spacious Magnetic Halls.
 Long-stoled he walks; reverend, glancing upwards, as in rapt
 commerce; an Antique Egyptian Hierophant in this new age. Soft
 music flits; breaking fitfully the sacred stillness. Round their
 Magnetic Mystery, which to the eye is mere tubs with water,—sit
 breathless, rod in hand, the circles of Beauty and Fashion, each
 circle a living circular _Passion-Flower:_ expecting the magnetic
 afflatus, and new-manufactured Heaven-on-Earth. O women, O men,
 great is your infidel-faith! A Parlementary Duport, a Bergasse,
 D’Espréménil we notice there; Chemist Berthollet too,—on the part
 of Monseigneur de Chartres. Had not the Academy of Sciences, with its Baillys, Franklins,
 Lavoisiers, interfered! But it did interfere. (Lacretelle, 18me
 Siecle, iii.258.) Mesmer may pocket his hard money, and withdraw.
 Let him walk silent by the shore of the Bodensee, by the ancient
 town of Constance; meditating on much. For so, under the
 strangest new vesture, the old great truth (since no vesture can
 hide it) begins again to be revealed: That man is what we call a
 miraculous creature, with miraculous power over men; and, on the
 whole, with such a Life in him, and such a World round him, as
 victorious Analysis, with her Physiologies, Nervous-systems,
 Physic and Metaphysic, will never completely _name_, to say
 nothing of explaining. Wherein also the Quack shall, in all ages,
 come in for his share.[48]
 Chapter 1.2.VII.
 Contrat Social. In such succession of singular prismatic tints, flush after flush
 suffusing our horizon, does the Era of Hope dawn on towards
 fulfilment. Questionable! As indeed, with an Era of Hope that
 rests on mere universal Benevolence, victorious Analysis, Vice
 cured of its deformity; and, in the long run, on Twenty-five dark
 savage Millions, looking up, in hunger and weariness, to that
 _Ecce-signum_ of theirs “forty feet high,”—how could it but be
 questionable? Through all time, if we read aright, sin was, is, will be, the
 parent of misery. This land calls itself most Christian, and has
 crosses and cathedrals; but its High-priest is some Roche-Aymon,
 some Necklace-Cardinal Louis de Rohan. The voice of the poor,
 through long years, ascends inarticulate, in _Jacqueries_,
 meal-mobs; low-whimpering of infinite moan: unheeded of the
 Earth; not unheeded of Heaven. Always moreover where the Millions
 are wretched, there are the Thousands straitened, unhappy; only
 the Units can flourish; or say rather, be ruined the last.
 Industry, all noosed and haltered, as if it too were some beast
 of chase for the mighty hunters of this world to bait, and cut
 slices from,—cries passionately to these its well-paid guides and
 watchers, not, _Guide me;_ but, _Laissez faire,_ Leave me alone
 of _your_ guidance! What market has Industry in this France? For
 two things there may be market and demand: for the coarser kind
 of field-fruits, since the Millions will live: for the fine kinds
 of luxury and spicery,—of multiform taste, from opera-melodies
 down to racers and courtesans; since the Units will be amused. It
 is at bottom but a mad state of things. To mend and remake all which we have, indeed, victorious
 Analysis. Honour to victorious Analysis; nevertheless, out of the
 Workshop and Laboratory, what thing was victorious Analysis yet
 known to make? Detection of incoherences, mainly; destruction of
 the incoherent. From of old, Doubt was but half a magician; she
 evokes the spectres which she cannot quell. We shall have
 “endless vortices of froth-logic;” whereon first words, and then
 things, are whirled and swallowed. Remark, accordingly, as
 acknowledged grounds of Hope, at bottom mere precursors of
 Despair, this perpetual theorising about Man, the Mind of Man,
 Philosophy of Government, Progress of the Species and such-like;
 the main thinking furniture of every head. Time, and so many
 Montesquieus, Mablys, spokesmen of Time, have discovered
 innumerable things: and now has not Jean Jacques promulgated his
 new Evangel of a _Contrat Social;_ explaining the whole mystery
 of Government, and how it is _contracted_ and bargained for,—to
 universal satisfaction? Theories of Government! Such have been,
 and will be; in ages of decadence. Acknowledge them in their
 degree; as processes of Nature, who does nothing in vain; as
 steps in her great process. Meanwhile, what theory is so certain
 as this, That all theories, were they never so earnest, painfully
 elaborated, are, and, by the very conditions of them, must be
 incomplete, questionable, and even false? Thou shalt know that
 this Universe is, what it professes to be, an _infinite_ one.
 Attempt not to swallow _it_, for thy logical digestion; be
 thankful, if skilfully planting down this and the other fixed
 pillar in the chaos, thou prevent its swallowing _thee_. That a
 new young generation has exchanged the Sceptic Creed, _What shall
 I believe?_ for passionate Faith in this Gospel according to Jean
 Jacques is a further step in the business; and betokens much. Blessed also is Hope; and always from the beginning there was
 some Millennium prophesied; Millennium of Holiness; but (what is
 notable) never till this new Era, any Millennium of mere Ease and
 plentiful Supply. In such prophesied Lubberland, of Happiness,
 Benevolence, and Vice cured of its deformity, trust not, my
 friends! Man is not what one calls a happy animal; his appetite
 for sweet victual is so enormous. How, in this wild Universe,
 which storms in on him, infinite, vague-menacing, shall poor man
 find, say not happiness, but existence, and footing to stand on,
 if it be not by girding himself together for continual endeavour
 and endurance? Woe, if in his heart there dwelt no devout Faith;
 if the word Duty had lost its meaning for him! For as to this of
 Sentimentalism, so useful for weeping with over romances and on
 pathetic occasions, it otherwise verily will avail nothing; nay
 less. The healthy heart that said to itself, “How healthy am I!”
 was already fallen into the fatalest sort of disease. Is not
 Sentimentalism twin-sister to Cant, if not one and the same with
 it? Is not Cant the _materia prima_ of the Devil; from which all
 falsehoods, imbecilities, abominations body themselves; from
 which no true thing _can_ come? For Cant is itself properly a
 double-distilled Lie; the second-power of a Lie. And now if a whole Nation fall into that? In such case, I answer,
 infallibly they will return out of it! For life is no
 cunningly-devised deception or self-deception: it is a great
 truth that thou art alive, that thou hast desires, necessities;
 neither can these subsist and satisfy themselves on delusions,
 but on fact. To fact, depend on it, we shall come back: to such
 fact, blessed or cursed, as we have wisdom for. The lowest, least
 blessed fact one knows of, on which necessitous mortals have ever
 based themselves, seems to be the primitive one of Cannibalism:
 That _I_ can devour _Thee_. What if such Primitive Fact were
 precisely the one we had (with our improved methods) to revert
 to, and begin anew from!
 Chapter 1.2.VIII.
 Printed Paper. In such a practical France, let the theory of Perfectibility say
 what it will, discontents cannot be wanting: your promised
 Reformation is so indispensable; yet it comes not; who will begin
 it—with himself? Discontent with what is around us, still more
 with what is above us, goes on increasing; seeking ever new
 vents. Of Street Ballads, of Epigrams that from of old tempered
 Despotism, we need not speak. Nor of Manuscript Newspapers
 (_Nouvelles à la main_) do we speak. Bachaumont and his
 journeymen and followers may close those “thirty volumes of
 scurrilous eaves-dropping,” and quit that trade; for at length if
 not liberty of the Press, there is license. Pamphlets can be
 surreptititiously vended and read in Paris, did they even bear to
 be “Printed at Pekin.” We have a _Courrier de l’Europe_ in those
 years, regularly published at London; by a De Morande, whom the
 guillotine has not yet devoured. There too an unruly Linguet,
 still unguillotined, when his own country has become too hot for
 him, and his brother Advocates have cast him out, can emit his
 hoarse wailings, and _Bastille Dévoilée_ (Bastille unveiled).
 Loquacious Abbé Raynal, at length, has his wish; sees the
 _Histoire Philosophique,_ with its “lubricity,” unveracity, loose
 loud eleutheromaniac rant (contributed, they say, by
 Philosophedom at large, though in the Abbé’s name, and to his
 glory), burnt by the common hangman;—and sets out on his travels
 as a martyr. It was the edition of 1781; perhaps the last notable
 book that had such fire-beatitude,—the hangman discovering now
 that it did not serve. Again, in Courts of Law, with their money-quarrels,
 divorce-cases, wheresoever a glimpse into the household existence
 can be had, what indications! The Parlements of Besancon and Aix
 ring, audible to all France, with the amours and destinies of a
 young Mirabeau. He, under the nurture of a “Friend of Men,” has,
 in State Prisons, in marching Regiments, Dutch Authors” garrets,
 and quite other scenes, “been for twenty years learning to resist
 despotism:” despotism of men, and alas also of gods. How, beneath
 this rose-coloured veil of Universal Benevolence and _Astræa
 Redux_, is the sanctuary of Home so often a dreary void, or a
 dark contentious Hell-on-Earth! The old Friend of Men has his own
 divorce case too; and at times, “his whole family but one” under
 lock and key: he writes much about reforming and enfranchising
 the world; and for his own private behoof he has needed sixty
 _Lettres-de-Cachet_. A man of insight too, with resolution, even
 with manful principle: but in such an element, inward and
 outward; which he could not rule, but only madden. Edacity,
 rapacity;—quite contrary to the finer sensibilities of the heart!
 Fools, that expect your verdant Millennium, and nothing but Love
 and Abundance, brooks running wine, winds whispering music,—with
 the whole ground and basis of your existence champed into a mud
 of Sensuality; which, daily growing deeper, will soon have no
 bottom but the Abyss! Or consider that unutterable business of the Diamond Necklace.
 Red-hatted Cardinal Louis de Rohan; Sicilian jail-bird Balsamo
 Cagliostro; milliner Dame de Lamotte, “with a face of some
 piquancy:” the highest Church Dignitaries waltzing, in Walpurgis
 Dance, with quack-prophets, pickpurses and public women;—a whole
 Satan’s Invisible World displayed; working there continually
 under the daylight visible one; the smoke of its torment going up
 for ever! The Throne has been brought into scandalous collision
 with the Treadmill. Astonished Europe rings with the mystery for
 ten months; sees only lie unfold itself from lie; corruption
 among the lofty and the low, gulosity, credulity, imbecility,
 strength nowhere but in the hunger. Weep, fair Queen, thy first
 tears of unmixed wretchedness! Thy fair name has been tarnished
 by foul breath; irremediably while life lasts. No more shalt thou
 be loved and pitied by living hearts, till a new generation has
 been born, and thy own heart lies cold, cured of all its
 sorrows.—The Epigrams henceforth become, not sharp and bitter;
 but cruel, atrocious, unmentionable. On that 31st of May, 1786, a
 miserable Cardinal Grand-Almoner Rohan, on issuing from his
 Bastille, is escorted by hurrahing crowds: unloved he, and worthy
 of no love; but important since the Court and Queen are his
 enemies.[49] How is our bright Era of Hope dimmed: and the whole sky growing
 bleak with signs of hurricane and earthquake! It is a doomed
 world: gone all “obedience that made men free;” fast going the
 obedience that made men slaves,—at least to one another. Slaves
 only of their own lusts they now are, and will be. Slaves of sin;
 inevitably also of sorrow. Behold the mouldering mass of
 Sensuality and Falsehood; round which plays foolishly, itself a
 corrupt phosphorescence, some glimmer of Sentimentalism;—and over
 all, rising, as Ark of _their_ Covenant, the grim Patibulary Fork
 “forty feet high;” which also is now nigh rotted. Add only that
 the French Nation distinguishes itself among Nations by the
 characteristic of Excitability; with the good, but also with the
 perilous evil, which belongs to that. Rebellion, explosion, of
 unknown extent is to be calculated on. There are, as Chesterfield
 wrote, “all the symptoms I have ever met with in History!”');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Shall we say, then: Wo to Philosophism, that it destroyed
 Religion, what it called “extinguishing the abomination (_écraser
 l’infâme_)”? Wo rather to those that made the Holy an
 abomination, and extinguishable; wo at all men that live in such
 a time of world-abomination and world-destruction! Nay, answer
 the Courtiers, it was Turgot, it was Necker, with their mad
 innovating; it was the Queen’s want of etiquette; it was he, it
 was she, it was that. Friends! it was every scoundrel that had
 lived, and quack-like pretended to be doing, and been only eating
 and _mis_doing, in all provinces of life, as Shoeblack or as
 Sovereign Lord, each in his degree, from the time of Charlemagne
 and earlier. All this (for be sure no falsehood perishes, but is
 as seed sown out to grow) has been storing itself for thousands
 of years; and now the account-day has come. And rude will the
 settlement be: of wrath laid up against the day of wrath. O my
 Brother, be not thou a Quack! Die rather, if thou wilt take
 counsel; ’tis but dying once, and thou art quit of it for ever.
 Cursed is that trade; and bears curses, thou knowest not how,
 long ages after thou art departed, and the wages thou hadst are
 all consumed; nay, as the ancient wise have written,—through
 Eternity itself, and is verily marked in the Doom-Book of a God! Hope deferred maketh the heart sick. And yet, as we said, Hope is
 but deferred; not abolished, not abolishable. It is very notable,
 and touching, how this same Hope does still light onwards the
 French Nation through all its wild destinies. For we shall still
 find Hope shining, be it for fond invitation, be it for anger and
 menace; as a mild heavenly light it shone; as a red conflagration
 it shines: burning sulphurous blue, through darkest regions of
 Terror, it still shines; and goes sent out at all, since
 Desperation itself is a kind of Hope. Thus is our Era still to be
 named of Hope, though in the saddest sense,—when there is nothing
 left but Hope. But if any one would know summarily what a Pandora’s Box lies
 there for the opening, he may see it in what by its nature is the
 symptom of all symptoms, the surviving Literature of the Period.
 Abbé Raynal, with his lubricity and loud loose rant, has spoken
 _his_ word; and already the fast-hastening generation responds to
 another. Glance at Beaumarchais’ _Mariage de Figaro;_ which now
 (in 1784), after difficulty enough, has issued on the stage; and
 “runs its hundred nights,” to the admiration of all men. By what
 virtue or internal vigour it so ran, the reader of our day will
 rather wonder:—and indeed will know so much the better that it
 flattered some pruriency of the time; that it spoke what all were
 feeling, and longing to speak. Small substance in that _Figaro:_
 thin wiredrawn intrigues, thin wiredrawn sentiments and sarcasms;
 a thing lean, barren; yet which winds and whisks itself, as
 through a wholly mad universe, adroitly, with a high-sniffing
 air: wherein each, as was hinted, which is the grand secret, may
 see some image of himself, and of his own state and ways. So it
 runs its hundred nights, and all France runs with it; laughing
 applause. If the soliloquising Barber ask: ‘What has your
 Lordship done to earn all this?’ and can only answer: ‘You took
 the trouble to be born (_Vous vous êtes donné la peine de
 naître_),’ all men must laugh: and a gay horse-racing Anglomaniac
 Noblesse loudest of all. For how can small books have a great
 danger in them? asks the Sieur Caron; and fancies his thin
 epigram may be a kind of reason. Conqueror of a golden fleece, by
 giant smuggling; tamer of hell-dogs, in the Parlement Maupeou;
 and finally crowned Orpheus in the _Théâtre Français_,
 Beaumarchais has now culminated, and unites the attributes of
 several demigods. We shall meet him once again, in the course of
 his decline. Still more significant are two Books produced on the eve of the
 ever-memorable Explosion itself, and read eagerly by all the
 world: Saint-Pierre’s _Paul et Virginie_, and Louvet’s _Chevalier
 de Faublas_. Noteworthy Books; which may be considered as the
 last speech of old Feudal France. In the first there rises
 melodiously, as it were, the wail of a moribund world: everywhere
 wholesome Nature in unequal conflict with diseased perfidious
 Art; cannot escape from it in the lowest hut, in the remotest
 island of the sea. Ruin and death must strike down the loved one;
 and, what is most significant of all, death even here not by
 necessity, but by etiquette. What a world of prurient corruption
 lies visible in that super-sublime of modesty! Yet, on the whole,
 our good Saint-Pierre is musical, poetical though most morbid: we
 will call his Book the swan-song of old dying France. Louvet’s again, let no man account musical. Truly, if this
 wretched _Faublas_ is a death-speech, it is one under the
 gallows, and by a felon that does not repent. Wretched _cloaca_
 of a Book; without depth even as a cloaca! What “picture of
 French society” is here? Picture properly of nothing, if not of
 the mind that gave it out as some sort of picture. Yet symptom of
 much; above all, of the world that could nourish itself thereon.
 BOOK 1.III.
 THE PARLEMENT OF PARIS
 Chapter 1.3.I.
 Dishonoured Bills. While the unspeakable confusion is everywhere weltering within,
 and through so many cracks in the surface sulphur-smoke is
 issuing, the question arises: Through what crevice will the main
 Explosion carry itself? Through which of the old craters or
 chimneys; or must it, at once, form a new crater for itself? In
 every Society are such chimneys, are Institutions serving as
 such: even Constantinople is not without its safety-valves; there
 too Discontent can vent itself,—in material fire; by the number
 of nocturnal conflagrations, or of hanged bakers, the Reigning
 Power can read the signs of the times, and change course
 according to these. We may say that this French Explosion will doubtless first try
 all the old Institutions of escape; for by each of these there
 is, or at least there used to be, some communication with the
 interior deep; they are national Institutions in virtue of that.
 Had they even become personal Institutions, and what we can call
 choked up from their original uses, there nevertheless must the
 impediment be weaker than elsewhere. Through which of them then?
 An observer might have guessed: Through the Law Parlements; above
 all, through the Parlement of Paris. Men, though never so thickly clad in dignities, sit not
 inaccessible to the influences of their time; especially men
 whose life is business; who at all turns, were it even from
 behind judgment-seats, have come in contact with the actual
 workings of the world. The Counsellor of Parlement, the President
 himself, who has bought his place with hard money that he might
 be looked up to by his fellow-creatures, how shall he, in all
 Philosophe-soirées, and saloons of elegant culture, become
 notable as a Friend of Darkness? Among the Paris Long-robes there
 may be more than one patriotic Malesherbes, whose rule is
 conscience and the public good; there are clearly more than one
 hotheaded D’Espréménil, to whose confused thought any loud
 reputation of the Brutus sort may seem glorious. The
 Lepelletiers, Lamoignons have titles and wealth; yet, at Court,
 are only styled “Noblesse of the Robe.” There are Duports of deep
 scheme; Fréteaus, Sabatiers, of incontinent tongue: all nursed
 more or less on the milk of the _Contrat Social_. Nay, for the
 whole Body, is not this patriotic opposition also a fighting for
 oneself? Awake, Parlement of Paris, renew thy long warfare! Was
 not the Parlement Maupeou abolished with ignominy? Not now hast
 thou to dread a Louis XIV., with the crack of his whip, and his
 Olympian looks; not now a Richelieu and Bastilles: no, the whole
 Nation is behind thee. Thou too (O heavens!) mayest become a
 Political Power; and with the shakings of thy horse-hair wig
 shake principalities and dynasties, like a very Jove with his
 ambrosial curls! Light old M. de Maurepas, since the end of 1781, has been fixed
 in the frost of death: ‘Never more,’ said the good Louis, ‘shall
 I hear his step overhead;’ his light jestings and gyratings are
 at an end. No more can the importunate reality be hidden by
 pleasant wit, and today’s evil be deftly rolled over upon
 tomorrow. The morrow itself has arrived; and now nothing but a
 solid phlegmatic M. de Vergennes sits there, in dull matter of
 fact, like some dull punctual Clerk (which he originally was);
 admits what cannot be denied, let the remedy come whence it will.
 In him is no remedy; only clerklike “despatch of business”
 according to routine. The poor King, grown older yet hardly more
 experienced, must himself, with such no-faculty as he has, begin
 governing; wherein also his Queen will give help. Bright Queen,
 with her quick clear glances and impulses; clear, and even noble;
 but all too superficial, vehement-shallow, for that work! To
 govern France were such a problem; and now it has grown well-nigh
 too hard to govern even the Œil-de-Bœuf. For if a distressed
 People has its cry, so likewise, and more audibly, has a bereaved
 Court. To the Œil-de-Bœuf it remains inconceivable how, in a
 France of such resources, the Horn of Plenty should run dry: did
 it not _use_ to flow? Nevertheless Necker, with his revenue of
 parsimony, has “suppressed above six hundred places,” before the
 Courtiers could oust him; parsimonious finance-pedant as he was.
 Again, a military pedant, Saint-Germain, with his Prussian
 manœuvres; with his Prussian notions, as if merit and not
 coat-of-arms should be the rule of promotion, has disaffected
 military men; the Mousquetaires, with much else are suppressed:
 for he too was one of your suppressors; and unsettling and
 oversetting, did mere mischief—to the Œil-de-Bœuf. Complaints
 abound; scarcity, anxiety: it is a changed Œil-de-Bœuf. Besenval
 says, already in these years (1781) there was such a melancholy
 (such a _tristesse_) about Court, compared with former days, as
 made it quite dispiriting to look upon. No wonder that the Œil-de-Bœuf feels melancholy, when you are
 suppressing its places! Not a place can be suppressed, but some
 purse is the lighter for it; and more than one heart the heavier;
 for did it not employ the working-classes too,—manufacturers,
 male and female, of laces, essences; of Pleasure generally,
 whosoever could manufacture Pleasure? Miserable economies; never
 felt over Twenty-five Millions! So, however, it goes on: and is
 not yet ended. Few years more and the Wolf-hounds shall fall
 suppressed, the Bear-hounds, the Falconry; places shall fall,
 thick as autumnal leaves. Duke de Polignac demonstrates, to the
 complete silencing of ministerial logic, that his place cannot be
 abolished; then gallantly, turning to the Queen, surrenders it,
 since her Majesty so wishes. Less chivalrous was Duke de Coigny,
 and yet not luckier: ‘We got into a real quarrel, Coigny and I,’
 said King Louis; ‘but if he had even struck me, I could not have
 blamed him.’[50] In regard to such matters there can be but one
 opinion. Baron Besenval, with that frankness of speech which
 stamps the independent man, plainly assures her Majesty that it
 is frightful (_affreux_); ‘you go to bed, and are not sure but
 you shall rise impoverished on the morrow: one might as well be
 in Turkey.’ It is indeed a dog’s life. How singular this perpetual distress of the royal treasury! And
 yet it is a thing not more incredible than undeniable. A thing
 mournfully true: the stumbling-block on which all Ministers
 successively stumble, and fall. Be it “want of fiscal genius,” or
 some far other want, there is the palpablest discrepancy between
 Revenue and Expenditure; a _Deficit_ of the Revenue: you must
 “choke (_combler_) the Deficit,” or else it will swallow you!
 This is the stern problem; hopeless seemingly as squaring of the
 circle. Controller Joly de Fleury, who succeeded Necker, could do
 nothing with it; nothing but propose loans, which were tardily
 filled up; impose new taxes, unproductive of money, productive of
 clamour and discontent. As little could Controller d’Ormesson do,
 or even less; for if Joly maintained himself beyond year and day,
 d’Ormesson reckons only by months: till “the King purchased
 Rambouillet without consulting him,” which he took as a hint to
 withdraw. And so, towards the end of 1783, matters threaten to
 come to still-stand. Vain seems human ingenuity. In vain has our
 newly-devised “Council of Finances” struggled, our Intendants of
 Finance, Controller-General of Finances: there are unhappily no
 Finances to control. Fatal paralysis invades the social movement;
 clouds, of blindness or of blackness, envelop us: are we breaking
 down, then, into the black horrors of NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY? Great is Bankruptcy: the great bottomless gulf into which all
 Falsehoods, public and private, do sink, disappearing; whither,
 from the first origin of them, they were all doomed. For Nature
 is true and not a lie. No lie you can speak or act but it will
 come, after longer or shorter circulation, like a Bill drawn on
 Nature’s Reality, and be presented there for payment,—with the
 answer, _No effects_. Pity only that it often had so long a
 circulation: that the original forger were so seldom he who bore
 the final smart of it! Lies, and the burden of evil they bring,
 are passed on; shifted from back to back, and from rank to rank;
 and so land ultimately on the dumb lowest rank, who with spade
 and mattock, with sore heart and empty wallet, daily come in
 _contact_ with reality, and can pass the cheat no further. Observe nevertheless how, by a just compensating law, if the lie
 with its burden (in this confused whirlpool of Society) sinks and
 is shifted ever downwards, then in return the distress of it
 rises ever upwards and upwards. Whereby, after the long pining
 and demi-starvation of those Twenty Millions, a Duke de Coigny
 and his Majesty come also to have their “real quarrel.” Such is
 the law of just Nature; bringing, though at long intervals, and
 were it only by Bankruptcy, matters round again to the mark. But with a Fortunatus’ Purse in his pocket, through what length
 of time might not almost any Falsehood last! Your Society, your
 Household, practical or spiritual Arrangement, is untrue, unjust,
 offensive to the eye of God and man. Nevertheless its hearth is
 warm, its larder well replenished: the innumerable Swiss of
 Heaven, with a kind of Natural loyalty, gather round it; will
 prove, by pamphleteering, musketeering, that it is a truth; or if
 not an unmixed (unearthly, impossible) Truth, then better, a
 wholesomely attempered one, (as wind is to the shorn lamb), and
 works well. Changed outlook, however, when purse and larder grow
 empty! Was your Arrangement so true, so accordant to Nature’s
 ways, then how, in the name of wonder, has Nature, with her
 infinite bounty, come to leave it famishing there? To all men, to
 all women and all children, it is now indutiable that your
 Arrangement was _false_. Honour to Bankruptcy; ever righteous on
 the great scale, though in detail it is so cruel! Under all
 Falsehoods it works, unweariedly mining. No Falsehood, did it
 rise heaven-high and cover the world, but Bankruptcy, one day,
 will sweep it down, and make us free of it.
 Chapter 1.3.II.
 Controller Calonne. Under such circumstances of _tristesse_, obstruction and sick
 langour, when to an exasperated Court it seems as if fiscal
 genius had departed from among men, what apparition could be
 welcomer than that of M. de Calonne? Calonne, a man of
 indisputable genius; even fiscal genius, more or less; of
 experience both in managing Finance and Parlements, for he has
 been Intendant at Metz, at Lille; King’s Procureur at Douai. A
 man of weight, connected with the moneyed classes; of unstained
 name,—if it were not some peccadillo (of showing a Client’s
 Letter) in that old D’Aiguillon-Lachalotais business, as good as
 forgotten now. He has kinsmen of heavy purse, felt on the Stock
 Exchange. Our Foulons, Berthiers intrigue for him:—old Foulon,
 who has now nothing to do but intrigue; who is known and even
 seen to be what they call a scoundrel; but of unmeasured wealth;
 who, from Commissariat-clerk which he once was, may hope, some
 think, if the game go right, to be Minister himself one day. Such propping and backing has M. de Calonne; and then
 intrinsically such qualities! Hope radiates from his face;
 persuasion hangs on his tongue. For all straits he has present
 remedy, and will make the world roll on wheels before him. On the
 3d of November 1783, the Œil-de-Bœuf rejoices in its new
 Controller-General. Calonne also shall have trial; Calonne also,
 in his way, as Turgot and Necker had done in theirs, shall
 forward the consummation; suffuse, with one other flush of
 brilliancy, our now too leaden-coloured Era of Hope, and wind it
 up—into fulfilment. Great, in any case, is the felicity of the Œil-de-Bœuf.
 Stinginess has fled from these royal abodes: suppression ceases;
 your Besenval may go peaceably to sleep, sure that he shall awake
 unplundered. Smiling Plenty, as if conjured by some enchanter,
 has returned; scatters contentment from her new-flowing horn. And
 mark what suavity of manners! A bland smile distinguishes our
 Controller: to all men he listens with an air of interest, nay of
 anticipation; makes their own wish clear to themselves, and
 grants it; or at least, grants conditional promise of it. ‘I fear
 this is a matter of difficulty,’ said her Majesty.—‘Madame,’
 answered the Controller, ‘if it is but difficult, it is done, if
 it is impossible, it shall be done (_se fera_).’ A man of such
 “facility” withal. To observe him in the pleasure-vortex of
 society, which none partakes of with more gusto, you might ask,
 When does he work? And yet his work, as we see, is never
 behindhand; above all, the fruit of his work: ready-money. Truly
 a man of incredible facility; facile action, facile elocution,
 facile thought: how, in mild suasion, philosophic depth sparkles
 up from him, as mere wit and lambent sprightliness; and in her
 Majesty’s Soirees, with the weight of a world lying on him, he is
 the delight of men and women! By what magic does he accomplish
 miracles? By the only true magic, that of genius. Men name him
 “_the_ Minister;” as indeed, when was there another such? Crooked
 things are become straight by him, rough places plain; and over
 the Œil-de-Bœuf there rests an unspeakable sunshine. Nay, in seriousness, let no man say that Calonne had not genius:
 genius for Persuading; before all things, for Borrowing. With the
 skilfulest judicious appliances of underhand money, he keeps the
 Stock-Exchanges flourishing; so that Loan after Loan is filled up
 as soon as opened. “Calculators likely to know”[51] have
 calculated that he spent, in extraordinaries, “at the rate of one
 million daily;” which indeed is some fifty thousand pounds
 sterling: but did he not procure something with it; namely peace
 and prosperity, for the time being? Philosophedom grumbles and
 croaks; buys, as we said, 80,000 copies of Necker’s new Book: but
 Nonpareil Calonne, in her Majesty’s Apartment, with the
 glittering retinue of Dukes, Duchesses, and mere happy admiring
 faces, can let Necker and Philosophedom croak. The misery is, such a time cannot last! Squandering, and Payment
 by Loan is no way to choke a Deficit. Neither is oil the
 substance for quenching conflagrations;—but, only for assuaging
 them, _not_ permanently! To the Nonpareil himself, who wanted not
 insight, it is clear at intervals, and dimly certain at all
 times, that his trade is by nature temporary, growing daily more
 difficult; that changes incalculable lie at no great distance.
 Apart from financial Deficit, the world is wholly in such a
 new-fangled humour; all things working loose from their old
 fastenings, towards new issues and combinations. There is not a
 dwarf _jokei_, a cropt Brutus’-head, or Anglomaniac horseman
 rising on his stirrups, that does not betoken change. But what
 then? The day, in any case, passes pleasantly; for the morrow, if
 the morrow come, there shall be counsel too. Once mounted (by
 munificence, suasion, magic of genius) high enough in favour with
 the Œil-de-Bœuf, with the King, Queen, Stock-Exchange, and so far
 as possible with all men, a Nonpareil Controller may hope to go
 careering through the Inevitable, in some unimagined way, as
 handsomely as another. At all events, for these three miraculous years, it has been
 expedient heaped on expedient; till now, with such cumulation and
 height, the pile topples perilous. And here has this
 world’s-wonder of a Diamond Necklace brought it at last to the
 clear verge of tumbling. Genius in that direction can no more:
 mounted high enough, or not mounted, we must fare forth. Hardly
 is poor Rohan, the Necklace-Cardinal, safely bestowed in the
 Auvergne Mountains, Dame de Lamotte (unsafely) in the
 Salpêtrière, and that mournful business hushed up, when our
 sanguine Controller once more astonishes the world. An expedient,
 unheard of for these hundred and sixty years, has been
 propounded; and, by dint of suasion (for his light audacity, his
 hope and eloquence are matchless) has been got
 adopted,—_Convocation of the Notables._ Let notable persons, the actual or virtual rulers of their
 districts, be summoned from all sides of France: let a true tale,
 of his Majesty’s patriotic purposes and wretched pecuniary
 impossibilities, be suasively told them; and then the question
 put: What are we to do? Surely to adopt healing measures; such as
 the magic of genius will unfold; such as, once sanctioned by
 Notables, all Parlements and all men must, with more or less
 reluctance, submit to.
 Chapter 1.3.III.
 The Notables. Here, then is verily a sign and wonder; visible to the whole
 world; bodeful of much. The Œil-de-Bœuf dolorously grumbles; were
 we not well as we stood,—quenching conflagrations by oil?
 Constitutional Philosophedom starts with joyful surprise; stares
 eagerly what the result will be. The public creditor, the public
 debtor, the whole thinking and thoughtless public have their
 several surprises, joyful and sorrowful. Count Mirabeau, who has
 got his matrimonial and other Lawsuits huddled up, better or
 worse; and works now in the dimmest element at Berlin; compiling
 _Prussian Monarchies_, Pamphlets _On Cagliostro;_ writing, with
 pay, but not with honourable recognition, innumerable Despatches
 for his Government,—scents or descries richer quarry from afar.
 He, like an eagle or vulture, or mixture of both, preens his
 wings for flight homewards.[52] M. de Calonne has stretched out an Aaron’s Rod over France;
 miraculous; and is summoning quite unexpected things. Audacity
 and hope alternate in him with misgivings; though the
 sanguine-valiant side carries it. Anon he writes to an intimate
 friend, ‘_Je me fais pitié à moi-même_ (I am an object of pity to
 myself);’ anon, invites some dedicating Poet or Poetaster to sing
 “this Assembly of the Notables and the Revolution that is
 preparing.”[53] Preparing indeed; and a matter to be sung,—only
 not till we have _seen_ it, and what the issue of it is. In deep
 obscure unrest, all things have so long gone rocking and swaying:
 will M. de Calonne, with this his alchemy of the Notables, fasten
 all together again, and get new revenues? Or wrench all asunder;
 so that it go no longer rocking and swaying, but clashing and
 colliding? Be this as it may, in the bleak short days, we behold men of
 weight and influence threading the great vortex of French
 Locomotion, each on his several line, from all sides of France
 towards the Château of Versailles: summoned thither _de par le
 roi_. There, on the 22d day of February 1787, they have met, and
 got installed: Notables to the number of a Hundred and
 Thirty-seven, as we count them name by name:[54] add Seven
 Princes of the Blood, it makes the round Gross of Notables. Men
 of the sword, men of the robe; Peers, dignified Clergy,
 Parlementary Presidents: divided into Seven Boards (_Bureaux_);
 under our Seven Princes of the Blood, Monsieur, D’Artois,
 Penthievre, and the rest; among whom let not our new Duke
 d’Orléans (for, since 1785, he is Chartres no longer) be
 forgotten. Never yet made Admiral, and now turning the corner of
 his fortieth year, with spoiled blood and prospects; half-weary
 of a world which is more than half-weary of him, Monseigneur’s
 future is most questionable. Not in illumination and insight, not
 even in conflagration; but, as was said, “in dull smoke and ashes
 of outburnt sensualities,” does he live and digest. Sumptuosity
 and sordidness; revenge, life-weariness, ambition, darkness,
 putrescence; and, say, in sterling money, three hundred thousand
 a year,—were this poor Prince once to burst loose from his
 Court-moorings, to what regions, with what phenomena, might he
 not sail and drift! Happily as yet he “affects to hunt daily;”
 sits there, since he must sit, presiding that Bureau of his, with
 dull moon-visage, dull glassy eyes, as if it were a mere tedium
 to him. We observe finally, that Count Mirabeau has actually arrived. He
 descends from Berlin, on the scene of action; glares into it with
 flashing sun-glance; discerns that it will do nothing for him. He
 had hoped these Notables might need a Secretary. They do need
 one; but have fixed on Dupont de Nemours; a man of smaller fame,
 but then of better;—who indeed, as his friends often hear,
 labours under this complaint, surely not a universal one, of
 having “five kings to correspond with.”[55] The pen of a Mirabeau
 cannot become an official one; nevertheless it remains a pen. In
 defect of Secretaryship, he sets to denouncing Stock-brokerage
 (_Dénonciation de l’Agiotage_); testifying, as his wont is, by
 loud bruit, that he is present and busy;—till, warned by friend
 Talleyrand, and even by Calonne himself underhand, that “a
 seventeenth _Lettre-de-Cachet_ may be launched against him,” he
 timefully flits over the marches. And now, in stately royal apartments, as Pictures of that time
 still represent them, our hundred and forty-four Notables sit
 organised; ready to hear and consider. Controller Calonne is
 dreadfully behindhand with his speeches, his preparatives;
 however, the man’s “facility of work” is known to us. For
 freshness of style, lucidity, ingenuity, largeness of view, that
 opening Harangue of his was unsurpassable:—had not the
 subject-matter been so appalling. A Deficit, concerning which
 accounts vary, and the Controller’s own account is not
 unquestioned; but which all accounts agree in representing as
 “enormous.” This is the epitome of our Controller’s difficulties:
 and then his means? Mere Turgotism; for thither, it seems, we
 must come at last: Provincial Assemblies; new Taxation; nay,
 strangest of all, new Land-tax, what he calls _Subvention
 Territoriale_, from which neither Privileged nor Unprivileged,
 Noblemen, Clergy, nor Parlementeers, shall be exempt! Foolish enough! These Privileged Classes have been used to tax;
 levying toll, tribute and custom, at all hands, while a penny was
 left: but to be themselves taxed? Of such Privileged persons,
 meanwhile, do these Notables, all but the merest fraction,
 consist. Headlong Calonne had given no heed to the “composition,”
 or judicious packing of them; but chosen such Notables as were
 really notable; trusting for the issue to off-hand ingenuity,
 good fortune, and eloquence that never yet failed. Headlong
 Controller-General! Eloquence can do much, but not all. Orpheus,
 with eloquence grown rhythmic, musical (what we call Poetry),
 drew iron tears from the cheek of Pluto: but by what witchery of
 rhyme or prose wilt thou from the pocket of Plutus draw gold? Accordingly, the storm that now rose and began to whistle round
 Calonne, first in these Seven Bureaus, and then on the outside of
 them, awakened by them, spreading wider and wider over all
 France, threatens to become unappeasable. A Deficit so enormous!
 Mismanagement, profusion is too clear. Peculation itself is
 hinted at; nay, Lafayette and others go so far as to speak it
 out, with attempts at proof. The blame of his Deficit our brave
 Calonne, as was natural, had endeavoured to shift from himself on
 his predecessors; not excepting even Necker. But now Necker
 vehemently denies; whereupon an “angry Correspondence,” which
 also finds its way into print. In the Œil-de-Bœuf, and her Majesty’s private Apartments, an
 eloquent Controller, with his ‘Madame, if it is but difficult,’
 had been persuasive: but, alas, the cause is now carried
 elsewhither. Behold him, one of these sad days, in Monsieur’s
 Bureau; to which all the other Bureaus have sent deputies. He is
 standing at bay: alone; exposed to an incessant fire of
 questions, interpellations, objurgations, from those “hundred and
 thirty-seven” pieces of logic-ordnance,—what we may well call
 _bouches à feu_, fire-mouths literally! Never, according to
 Besenval, or hardly ever, had such display of intellect,
 dexterity, coolness, suasive eloquence, been made by man. To the
 raging play of so many fire-mouths he opposes nothing angrier
 than light-beams, self-possession and fatherly smiles. With the
 imperturbablest bland clearness, he, for five hours long, keeps
 answering the incessant volley of fiery captious questions,
 reproachful interpellations; in words prompt as lightning, quiet
 as light. Nay, the cross-fire too: such side questions and
 incidental interpellations as, in the heat of the main-battle, he
 (having only one tongue) could not get answered; these also he
 takes up at the first slake; answers even these.[56] Could
 blandest suasive eloquence have saved France, she were saved.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Heavy-laden Controller! In the Seven Bureaus seems nothing but
 hindrance: in Monsieur’s Bureau, a Loménie de Brienne, Archbishop
 of Toulouse, with an eye himself to the Controllership, stirs up
 the Clergy; there are meetings, underground intrigues. Neither
 from without anywhere comes sign of help or hope. For the Nation
 (where Mirabeau is now, with stentor-lungs, “denouncing Agio”)
 the Controller has hitherto done nothing, or less. For
 Philosophedom he has done as good as nothing,—sent out some
 scientific Lapérouse, or the like: and is he not in “angry
 correspondence” with its Necker? The very Œil-de-Bœuf looks
 questionable; a falling Controller has no friends. Solid M. de
 Vergennes, who with his phlegmatic judicious punctuality might
 have kept down many things, died the very week before these
 sorrowful Notables met. And now a Seal-keeper, _Garde-des-Sceaux_
 Miroménil is thought to be playing the traitor: spinning plots
 for Loménie-Brienne! Queen’s-Reader Abbé de Vermond, unloved
 individual, was Brienne’s creature, the work of his hands from
 the first: it may be feared the backstairs passage is open,
 ground getting mined under our feet. Treacherous Garde-des-Sceaux
 Miroménil, at least, should be dismissed; Lamoignon, the eloquent
 Notable, a stanch man, with connections, and even ideas,
 Parlement-President yet intent on reforming Parlements, were not
 he the right Keeper? So, for one, thinks busy Besenval; and, at
 dinner-table, rounds the same into the Controller’s ear,—who
 always, in the intervals of landlord-duties, listens to him as
 with charmed look, but answers nothing positive.[57] Alas, what to answer? The force of private intrigue, and then
 also the force of public opinion, grows so dangerous, confused!
 Philosophedom sneers aloud, as if its Necker already triumphed.
 The gaping populace gapes over Wood-cuts or Copper-cuts; where,
 for example, a Rustic is represented convoking the poultry of his
 barnyard, with this opening address: ‘Dear animals, I have
 assembled you to advise me what sauce I shall dress you with;’ to
 which a Cock responding, ‘We don’t want to be eaten,’ is checked
 by ‘You wander from the point (_Vous vous écartez de la
 question_).’[58] Laughter and logic; ballad-singer, pamphleteer;
 epigram and caricature: what wind of public opinion is this,—as
 if the Cave of the Winds were bursting loose! At nightfall,
 President Lamoignon steals over to the Controller’s; finds him
 “walking with large strides in his chamber, like one out of
 himself.”[59] With rapid confused speech the Controller begs M.
 de Lamoignon to give him “an advice.” Lamoignon candidly answers
 that, except in regard to his own anticipated Keepership, unless
 that would prove remedial, he really cannot take upon him to
 advise. “On the Monday after Easter,” the 9th of April 1787, a date one
 rejoices to verify, for nothing can excel the indolent falsehood
 of these _Histoires and Mémoires_,—“On the Monday after Easter,
 as I, Besenval, was riding towards Romainville to the Maréchal de
 Segur’s, I met a friend on the Boulevards, who told me that M. de
 Calonne was out. A little further on came M. the Duke d’Orléans,
 dashing towards me, head to the wind” (trotting _à l’Anglaise_),
 “and confirmed the news.”[60] It is true news. Treacherous
 Garde-des-Sceaux Miroménil is gone, and Lamoignon is appointed in
 his room: but appointed for his own profit only, not for the
 Controller’s: “next day” the Controller also has had to move. A
 little longer he may linger near; be seen among the money
 changers, and even “working in the Controller’s office,” where
 much lies unfinished: but neither will that hold. Too strong
 blows and beats this tempest of public opinion, of private
 intrigue, as from the Cave of all the Winds; and blows him
 (higher Authority giving sign) out of Paris and France,—over the
 horizon, into Invisibility, or outer Darkness. Such destiny the magic of genius could not forever avert.
 Ungrateful Œil-de-Bœuf! did he not miraculously rain gold manna
 on you; so that, as a Courtier said, ‘All the world held out its
 hand, and I held out my hat,’—for a time? Himself is poor;
 penniless, had not a “Financier’s widow in Lorraine” offered him,
 though he was turned of fifty, her hand and the rich purse it
 held. Dim henceforth shall be his activity, though unwearied:
 Letters to the King, Appeals, Prognostications; Pamphlets (from
 London), written with the old suasive facility; which however do
 not persuade. Luckily his widow’s purse fails not. Once, in a
 year or two, some shadow of him shall be seen hovering on the
 Northern Border, seeking election as National Deputy; but be
 sternly beckoned away. Dimmer then, far-borne over utmost
 European lands, in uncertain twilight of diplomacy, he shall
 hover, intriguing for “Exiled Princes,” and have adventures; be
 overset into the Rhine stream and half-drowned, nevertheless save
 his papers dry. Unwearied, but in vain! In France he works
 miracles no more; shall hardly return thither to find a grave.
 Farewell, thou facile sanguine Controller-General, with thy light
 rash hand, thy suasive mouth of gold: worse men there have been,
 and better; but to thee also was allotted a task,—of raising the
 wind, and the winds; and thou hast done it. But now, while Ex-Controller Calonne flies storm-driven over the
 horizon, in this singular way, what has become of the
 Controllership? It hangs vacant, one may say; extinct, like the
 Moon in her vacant interlunar cave. Two preliminary shadows, poor
 M. Fourqueux, poor M. Villedeuil, do hold in quick succession
 some simulacrum of it,[61]—as the new Moon will sometimes shine
 out with a dim preliminary old one in her arms. Be patient, ye
 Notables! An actual new Controller is certain, and even ready;
 were the indispensable manœuvres but gone through. Long-headed
 Lamoignon, with Home Secretary Bréteuil, and Foreign Secretary
 Montmorin have exchanged looks; let these three once meet and
 speak. Who is it that is strong in the Queen’s favour, and the
 Abbé de Vermond’s? That is a man of great capacity? Or at least
 that has struggled, these fifty years, to have it thought great;
 now, in the Clergy’s name, demanding to have Protestant
 death-penalties “put in execution;” no flaunting it in the
 Œil-de-Bœuf, as the gayest man-pleaser and woman-pleaser;
 gleaning even a good word from Philosophedom and your Voltaires
 and D’Alemberts? With a party ready-made for him in the
 Notables?—Loménie de Brienne, Archbishop of Toulouse! answer all
 the three, with the clearest instantaneous concord; and rush off
 to propose him to the King; “in such haste,” says Besenval, “that
 M. de Lamoignon had to borrow a _simarre_,” seemingly some kind
 of cloth apparatus necessary for that.[62] Loménie-Brienne, who had all his life “felt a kind of
 predestination for the highest offices,” has now therefore
 obtained them. He presides over the Finances; he shall have the
 title of Prime Minister itself, and the effort of his long life
 be realised. Unhappy only that it took such talent and industry
 to _gain_ the place; that to _qualify_ for it hardly any talent
 or industry was left disposable! Looking now into his inner man,
 what qualification he may have, Loménie beholds, not without
 astonishment, next to nothing but vacuity and possibility.
 Principles or methods, acquirement outward or inward (for his
 very body is wasted, by hard tear and wear) he finds none; not so
 much as a plan, even an unwise one. Lucky, in these
 circumstances, that Calonne has had a plan! Calonne’s plan was
 gathered from Turgot’s and Necker’s by compilation; shall become
 Loménie’s by adoption. Not in vain has Loménie studied the
 working of the British Constitution; for he professes to have
 some Anglomania, of a sort. Why, in that free country, does one
 Minister, driven out by Parliament, vanish from his King’s
 presence, and another enter, borne in by Parliament?[63] Surely
 not for mere change (which is ever wasteful); but that all men
 may have share of what is going; and so the strife of Freedom
 indefinitely prolong itself, and no harm be done. The Notables, mollified by Easter festivities, by the sacrifice
 of Calonne, are not in the worst humour. Already his Majesty,
 while the “interlunar shadows” were in office, had held session
 of Notables; and from his throne delivered promissory
 conciliatory eloquence: “The Queen stood waiting at a window,
 till his carriage came back; and Monsieur from afar clapped hands
 to her,” in sign that all was well.[64] It has had the best
 effect; if such do but last. Leading Notables meanwhile can be
 “caressed;” Brienne’s new gloss, Lamoignon’s long head will
 profit somewhat; conciliatory eloquence shall not be wanting. On
 the whole, however, is it not undeniable that this of ousting
 Calonne and adopting the plans of Calonne, is a measure which, to
 produce its best effect, should be looked at from a certain
 distance, cursorily; not dwelt on with minute near scrutiny. In a
 word, that no service the Notables could now do were so obliging
 as, in some handsome manner, to—take themselves away! Their “Six
 Propositions” about Provisional Assemblies, suppression of
 _Corvées_ and suchlike, can be accepted without criticism. The
 _Subvention_ on Land-tax, and much else, one must glide hastily
 over; safe nowhere but in flourishes of conciliatory eloquence.
 Till at length, on this 25th of May, year 1787, in solemn final
 session, there bursts forth what we can call an explosion of
 eloquence; King, Loménie, Lamoignon and retinue taking up the
 successive strain; in harrangues to the number of ten, besides
 his Majesty’s, which last the livelong day;—whereby, as in a kind
 of choral anthem, or bravura peal, of thanks, praises, promises,
 the Notables are, so to speak, organed out, and dismissed to
 their respective places of abode. They had sat, and talked, some
 nine weeks: they were the first Notables since Richelieu’s, in
 the year 1626. By some Historians, sitting much at their ease, in the safe
 distance, Loménie has been blamed for this dismissal of his
 Notables: nevertheless it was clearly time. There are things, as
 we said, which should not be dwelt on with minute close scrutiny:
 over hot coals you cannot glide too fast. In these Seven Bureaus,
 where no work could be done, unless talk were work, the
 questionablest matters were coming up. Lafayette, for example, in
 Monseigneur d’Artois’ Bureau, took upon him to set forth more
 than one deprecatory oration about _Lettres-de-Cachet_, Liberty
 of the Subject, _Agio_, and suchlike; which Monseigneur
 endeavouring to repress, was answered that a Notable being
 summoned to speak his opinion must speak it.[65] Thus too his Grace the Archbishop of Aix perorating once, with a
 plaintive pulpit tone, in these words? ‘Tithe, that free-will
 offering of the piety of Christians’—‘Tithe,’ interrupted Duke la
 Rochefoucault, with the cold business-manner he has learned from
 the English, ‘that free-will offering of the piety of Christians;
 on which there are now forty-thousand lawsuits in this
 realm.’[66] Nay, Lafayette, bound to speak his opinion, went the
 length, one day, of proposing to convoke a “National Assembly.”
 ‘You demand States-General?’ asked Monseigneur with an air of
 minatory surprise.—‘Yes, Monseigneur; and even better than
 that.’—‘Write it,’ said Monseigneur to the Clerks.[67]—Written
 accordingly it is; and what is more, will be acted by and by.
 Chapter 1.3.IV.
 Loménie’s Edicts. Thus, then, have the Notables returned home; carrying to all
 quarters of France, such notions of deficit, decrepitude,
 distraction; and that States-General will cure it, or will not
 cure it but kill it. Each Notable, we may fancy, is as a funeral
 torch; disclosing hideous abysses, better left hid! The
 unquietest humour possesses all men; ferments, seeks issue, in
 pamphleteering, caricaturing, projecting, declaiming; vain
 jangling of thought, word and deed. It is Spiritual Bankruptcy, long tolerated; verging now towards
 Economical Bankruptcy, and become intolerable. For from the
 lowest dumb rank, the inevitable misery, as was predicted, has
 spread upwards. In every man is some obscure feeling that his
 position, oppressive or else oppressed, is a false one: all men,
 in one or the other acrid dialect, as assaulters or as defenders,
 must give vent to the unrest that is in them. Of such stuff
 national well-being, and the glory of rulers, is not made. O
 Loménie, what a wild-heaving, waste-looking, hungry and angry
 world hast thou, after lifelong effort, got promoted to take
 charge of! Loménie’s first Edicts are mere soothing ones: creation of
 Provincial Assemblies, “for apportioning the imposts,” when we
 get any; suppression of _Corvées_ or statute-labour; alleviation
 of _Gabelle_. Soothing measures, recommended by the Notables;
 long clamoured for by all liberal men. Oil cast on the waters has
 been known to produce a good effect. Before venturing with great
 essential measures, Loménie will see this singular “swell of the
 public mind” abate somewhat. Most proper, surely. But what if it were not a swell of the
 abating kind? There are swells that come of upper tempest and
 wind-gust. But again there are swells that come of subterranean
 pent wind, some say; and even of inward decomposition, of decay
 that has become self-combustion:—as when, according to
 Neptuno-Plutonic Geology, the World is all decayed down into due
 attritus of this sort; and shall now be _exploded_, and new-made!
 These latter abate not by oil.—The fool says in his heart, How
 shall not tomorrow be as yesterday; as all days,—which were once
 tomorrows? The wise man, looking on this France, moral,
 intellectual, economical, sees, “in short, all the symptoms he
 has ever met with in history,”—unabatable by soothing Edicts. Meanwhile, abate or not, cash must be had; and for that quite
 another sort of Edicts, namely “bursal” or fiscal ones. How easy
 were fiscal Edicts, did you know for certain that the Parlement
 of Paris would what they call “register” them! Such right of
 registering, properly of mere _writing down_, the Parlement has
 got by old wont; and, though but a Law-Court, can remonstrate,
 and higgle considerably about the same. Hence many quarrels;
 desperate Maupeou devices, and victory and defeat;—a quarrel now
 near forty years long. Hence fiscal Edicts, which otherwise were
 easy enough, become such problems. For example, is there not
 Calonne’s _Subvention Territoriale_, universal, unexempting
 Land-tax; the sheet-anchor of Finance? Or, to show, so far as
 possible, that one is not without original finance talent,
 Loménie himself can devise an _Edit du Timbre_ or
 Stamp-tax,—borrowed also, it is true; but then from America: may
 it prove luckier in France than there! France has her resources: nevertheless, it cannot be denied, the
 aspect of that Parlement is questionable. Already among the
 Notables, in that final symphony of dismissal, the Paris
 President had an ominous tone. Adrien Duport, quitting magnetic
 sleep, in this agitation of the world, threatens to rouse himself
 into preternatural wakefulness. Shallower but also louder, there
 is magnetic D’Espréménil, with his tropical heat (he was born at
 Madras); with his dusky confused violence; holding of
 Illumination, Animal Magnetism, Public Opinion, Adam Weisshaupt,
 Harmodius and Aristogiton, and all manner of confused violent
 things: of whom can come no good. The very Peerage is infected
 with the leaven. Our Peers have, in too many cases, laid aside
 their frogs, laces, bagwigs; and go about in English costume, or
 ride rising in their stirrups,—in the most headlong manner;
 nothing but insubordination, eleutheromania, confused unlimited
 opposition in their heads. Questionable: not to be ventured upon,
 if we had a Fortunatus’ Purse! But Loménie has waited all June,
 casting on the waters what oil he had; and now, betide as it may,
 the two Finance Edicts must out. On the 6th of July, he forwards
 his proposed Stamp-tax and Land-tax to the Parlement of Paris;
 and, as if putting his own leg foremost, not his borrowed
 Calonne’s-leg, places the Stamp-tax first in order. Alas, the Parlement will _not_ register: the Parlement demands
 instead a “state of the expenditure,” a “state of the
 contemplated reductions;” “states” enough; which his Majesty must
 decline to furnish! Discussions arise; patriotic eloquence: the
 Peers are summoned. Does the Nemean Lion begin to bristle? Here
 surely is a duel, which France and the Universe may look upon:
 with prayers; at lowest, with curiosity and bets. Paris stirs
 with new animation. The outer courts of the Palais de Justice
 roll with unusual crowds, coming and going; their huge outer hum
 mingles with the clang of patriotic eloquence within, and gives
 vigour to it. Poor Loménie gazes from the distance, little
 comforted; has his invisible emissaries flying to and fro,
 assiduous, without result. So pass the sultry dog-days, in the most electric manner; and the
 whole month of July. And still, in the Sanctuary of Justice,
 sounds nothing but Harmodius-Aristogiton eloquence, environed
 with the hum of crowding Paris; and no registering accomplished,
 and no “states” furnished. ‘States?’ said a lively Parlementeer:
 ‘Messieurs, the states that should be furnished us, in my opinion
 are the STATES-GENERAL.’ On which timely joke there follow
 cachinnatory buzzes of approval. What a word to be spoken in the
 Palais de Justice! Old D’Ormesson (the Ex-Controller’s uncle)
 shakes his judicious head; far enough from laughing. But the
 outer courts, and Paris and France, catch the glad sound, and
 repeat it; shall repeat it, and re-echo and reverberate it, till
 it grow a deafening peal. Clearly enough here is no registering
 to be thought of. The pious Proverb says, “There are remedies for all things but
 death.” When a Parlement refuses registering, the remedy, by long
 practice, has become familiar to the simplest: a Bed of Justice.
 One complete month this Parlement has spent in mere idle
 jargoning, and sound and fury; the _Timbre_ Edict not registered,
 or like to be; the _Subvention_ not yet so much as spoken of. On
 the 6th of August let the whole refractory Body roll out, in
 wheeled vehicles, as far as the King’s Château of Versailles;
 there shall the King, holding his Bed of Justice, _order_ them,
 by his own royal lips, to register. They may remonstrate, in an
 under tone; but they must obey, lest a worse unknown thing befall
 them. It is done: the Parlement has rolled out, on royal summons; has
 heard the express royal order to register. Whereupon it has
 rolled back again, amid the hushed expectancy of men. And now,
 behold, on the morrow, this Parlement, seated once more in its
 own Palais, with “crowds inundating the outer courts,” not only
 does not register, but (O portent!) declares all that was done on
 the prior day to be _null_, and the Bed of Justice as good as a
 futility! In the history of France here verily is a new feature.
 Nay better still, our heroic Parlement, getting suddenly
 enlightened on several things, declares that, for its part, it is
 incompetent to register Tax-edicts at all,—having done it by
 mistake, during these late centuries; that for such act one
 authority only is competent: the assembled Three Estates of the
 Realm! To such length can the universal spirit of a Nation penetrate the
 most isolated Body-corporate: say rather, with such weapons,
 homicidal and suicidal, in exasperated political duel, will
 Bodies-corporate fight! But, in any case, is not this the real
 death-grapple of war and internecine duel, Greek meeting Greek;
 whereon men, had they even no interest in it, might look with
 interest unspeakable? Crowds, as was said, inundate the outer
 courts: inundation of young eleutheromaniac Noblemen in English
 costume, uttering audacious speeches; of Procureurs,
 Basoche-Clerks, who are idle in these days: of Loungers,
 Newsmongers and other nondescript classes,—rolls tumultuous
 there. “From three to four thousand persons,” waiting eagerly to
 hear the _Arrêtés_ (Resolutions) you arrive at within; applauding
 with bravos, with the clapping of from six to eight thousand
 hands! Sweet also is the meed of patriotic eloquence, when your
 D’Espréménil, your Fréteau, or Sabatier, issuing from his
 Demosthenic Olympus, the thunder being hushed for the day, is
 welcomed, in the outer courts, with a shout from four thousand
 throats; is borne home shoulder-high “with benedictions,” and
 strikes the stars with his sublime head.
 Chapter 1.3.V.
 Loménie’s Thunderbolts. Arise, Loménie-Brienne: here is no case for “Letters of Jussion;”
 for faltering or compromise. Thou seest the whole loose _fluent_
 population of Paris (whatsoever is not solid, and fixed to work)
 inundating these outer courts, like a loud destructive deluge;
 the very Basoche of Lawyers’ Clerks talks sedition. The lower
 classes, in this duel of Authority with Authority, Greek
 throttling Greek, have ceased to respect the City-Watch:
 Police-satellites are marked on the back with chalk (the M
 signifies _mouchard_, spy); they are hustled, hunted like _feræ
 naturæ_. Subordinate rural Tribunals send messengers of
 congratulation, of adherence. Their Fountain of Justice is
 becoming a Fountain of Revolt. The Provincial Parlements look on,
 with intent eye, with breathless wishes, while their elder sister
 of Paris does battle: the whole Twelve are of one blood and
 temper; the victory of one is that of all. Ever worse it grows: on the 10th of August, there is “_Plainte_”
 emitted touching the “prodigalities of Calonne,” and permission
 to “proceed” against him. No registering, but instead of it,
 denouncing: of dilapidation, peculation; and ever the burden of
 the song, States-General! Have the royal armories no thunderbolt,
 that thou couldst, O Loménie, with red right-hand, launch it
 among these Demosthenic theatrical thunder-barrels, mere resin
 and noise for most part;—and shatter, and smite them silent? On
 the night of the 14th of August, Loménie launches his
 thunderbolt, or handful of them. Letters named of the Seal (_de
 Cachet_), as many as needful, some sixscore and odd, are
 delivered overnight. And so, next day betimes, the whole
 Parlement, once more set on wheels, is rolling incessantly
 towards Troyes in Champagne; “escorted,” says History, “with the
 blessings of all people;” the very innkeepers and postillions
 looking gratuitously reverent.[68] This is the 15th of August
 1787. What will not people bless; in their extreme need? Seldom had the
 Parlement of Paris deserved much blessing, or received much. An
 isolated Body-corporate, which, out of old confusions (while the
 Sceptre of the Sword was confusedly struggling to become a
 Sceptre of the Pen), had got itself together, better and worse,
 as Bodies-corporate do, to satisfy some dim desire of the world,
 and many clear desires of individuals; and so had grown, in the
 course of centuries, on concession, on acquirement and
 usurpation, to be what we see it: a prosperous social Anomaly,
 deciding Lawsuits, sanctioning or rejecting Laws; and withal
 disposing of its places and offices by sale for ready
 money,—which method sleek President Hénault, after meditation,
 will demonstrate to be the indifferent-best.[69] In such a Body, existing by purchase for ready-money, there could
 not be excess of public spirit; there might well be excess of
 eagerness to divide the public spoil. Men in helmets have divided
 that, with swords; men in wigs, with quill and inkhorn, do divide
 it: and even more hatefully these latter, if more peaceably; for
 the wig-method is at once irresistibler and baser. By long
 experience, says Besenval, it has been found useless to sue a
 Parlementeer at law; no Officer of Justice will serve a writ on
 one; his wig and gown are his Vulcan’s-panoply, his enchanted
 cloak-of-darkness. The Parlement of Paris may count itself an unloved body; mean,
 not magnanimous, on the political side. Were the King weak,
 always (as now) has his Parlement barked, cur-like at his heels;
 with what popular cry there might be. Were he strong, it barked
 before his face; hunting for him as his alert beagle. An unjust
 Body; where foul influences have more than once worked shameful
 perversion of judgment. Does not, in these very days, the blood
 of murdered Lally cry aloud for vengeance? Baited, circumvented,
 driven mad like the snared lion, Valour had to sink extinguished
 under vindictive Chicane. Behold him, that hapless Lally, his
 wild dark soul looking through his wild dark face; trailed on the
 ignominious death-hurdle; the voice of his despair choked by a
 wooden gag! The wild fire-soul that has known only peril and
 toil; and, for threescore years, has buffeted against Fate’s
 obstruction and men’s perfidy, like genius and courage amid
 poltroonery, dishonesty and commonplace; faithfully enduring and
 endeavouring,—O Parlement of Paris, dost thou reward it with a
 gibbet and a gag?[70] The dying Lally bequeathed his memory to
 his boy; a young Lally has arisen, demanding redress in the name
 of God and man. The Parlement of Paris does its utmost to defend
 the indefensible, abominable; nay, what is singular,
 dusky-glowing Aristogiton d’Espréménil is the man chosen to be
 its spokesman in that. Such Social Anomaly is it that France now blesses. An unclean
 Social Anomaly; but in duel against another worse! The exiled
 Parlement is felt to have “covered itself with glory.” There are
 quarrels in which even Satan, bringing help, were not unwelcome;
 even Satan, fighting stiffly, might cover himself with glory,—of
 a temporary sort. But what a stir in the outer courts of the Palais, when Paris
 finds its Parlement trundled off to Troyes in Champagne; and
 nothing left but a few mute Keepers of records; the Demosthenic
 thunder become extinct, the martyrs of liberty clean gone!
 Confused wail and menace rises from the four thousand throats of
 Procureurs, Basoche-Clerks, Nondescripts, and Anglomaniac
 Noblesse; ever new idlers crowd to see and hear; Rascality, with
 increasing numbers and vigour, hunts _mouchards_. Loud whirlpool
 rolls through these spaces; the rest of the City, fixed to its
 work, cannot yet go rolling. Audacious placards are legible, in
 and about the Palais, the speeches are as good as seditious.
 Surely the temper of Paris is much changed. On the third day of
 this business (18th of August), Monsieur and Monseigneur
 d’Artois, coming in state-carriages, according to use and wont,
 to have these late obnoxious _Arrêtés_ and protests “expunged”
 from the Records, are received in the most marked manner.
 Monsieur, who is thought to be in opposition, is met with vivats
 and strewed flowers; Monseigneur, on the other hand, with
 silence; with murmurs, which rise to hisses and groans; nay, an
 irreverent Rascality presses towards him in floods, with such
 hissing vehemence, that the Captain of the Guards has to give
 order, ‘_Haut les armes_ (Handle arms)!’—at which thunder-word,
 indeed, and the flash of the clear iron, the Rascal-flood
 recoils, through all avenues, fast enough.[71] New features
 these. Indeed, as good M. de Malesherbes pertinently remarks, ‘it
 is a quite new kind of contest this with the Parlement:’ no
 transitory sputter, as from collision of hard bodies; but more
 like ‘the first sparks of what, if not quenched, may become a
 great conflagration.’[72] This good Malesherbes sees himself now again in the King’s
 Council, after an absence of ten years: Loménie would profit if
 not by the faculties of the man, yet by the name he has. As for
 the man’s opinion, it is not listened to;—wherefore he will soon
 withdraw, a second time; back to his books and his trees. In such
 King’s Council what can a good man profit? Turgot tries it not a
 second time: Turgot has quitted France and this Earth, some years
 ago; and now cares for none of these things. Singular enough:
 Turgot, this same Loménie, and the Abbé Morellet were once a trio
 of young friends; fellow-scholars in the Sorbonne. Forty new
 years have carried them severally thus far. Meanwhile the Parlement sits daily at Troyes, calling cases; and
 daily adjourns, no Procureur making his appearance to plead.
 Troyes is as hospitable as could be looked for: nevertheless one
 has comparatively a dull life. No crowds now to carry you,
 shoulder-high, to the immortal gods; scarcely a Patriot or two
 will drive out so far, and bid you be of firm courage. You are in
 furnished lodgings, far from home and domestic comfort: little to
 do, but wander over the unlovely Champagne fields; seeing the
 grapes ripen; taking counsel about the thousand-times consulted:
 a prey to tedium; in danger even that Paris may forget you.
 Messengers come and go: pacific Loménie is not slack in
 negotiating, promising; D’Ormesson and the prudent elder Members
 see no good in strife. After a dull month, the Parlement, yielding and retaining, makes
 truce, as all Parlements must. The Stamp-tax is withdrawn: the
 _Subvention_ Land-tax is also withdrawn; but, in its stead, there
 is granted, what they call a “Prorogation of the Second
 Twentieth,”—itself a kind of Land-tax, but not so oppressive to
 the Influential classes; which lies mainly on the Dumb class.
 Moreover, secret promises exist (on the part of the Elders), that
 finances may be raised by Loan. Of the ugly word States-General
 there shall be no mention. And so, on the 20th of September, our exiled Parlement returns:
 D’Espréménil said, “it went out covered with glory, but had come
 back covered with mud (_de boue_).” Not so, Aristogiton; or if
 so, thou surely art the man to clean it.
 Chapter 1.3.VI.
 Loménie’s Plots. Was ever unfortunate Chief Minister so bested as Loménie-Brienne?
 The reins of the State fairly in his hand these six months; and
 not the smallest motive-power (of Finance) to stir from the spot
 with, this way or that! He flourishes his whip, but advances not.
 Instead of ready-money, there is nothing but rebellious debating
 and recalcitrating. Far is the public mind from having calmed; it goes chafing and
 fuming ever worse: and in the royal coffers, with such yearly
 Deficit running on, there is hardly the colour of coin. Ominous
 prognostics! Malesherbes, seeing an exhausted, exasperated France
 grow hotter and hotter, talks of “conflagration:” Mirabeau,
 without talk, has, as we perceive, descended on Paris again,
 close on the rear of the Parlement,[73]—not to quit his native
 soil any more. Over the Frontiers, behold Holland invaded by Prussia;[74] the
 French party oppressed, England and the Stadtholder triumphing:
 to the sorrow of War-Secretary Montmorin and all men. But without
 money, sinews of war, as of work, and of existence itself, what
 can a Chief Minister do? Taxes profit little: this of the Second
 Twentieth falls not due till next year; and will then, with its
 “strict valuation,” produce more controversy than cash. Taxes on
 the Privileged Classes cannot be got registered; are intolerable
 to our supporters themselves: taxes on the Unprivileged yield
 nothing,—as from a thing drained dry more cannot be drawn. Hope
 is nowhere, if not in the old refuge of Loans.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' To Loménie, aided by the long head of Lamoignon, deeply pondering
 this sea of troubles, the thought suggested itself: Why not have
 a Successive Loan (_Emprunt Successif_), or Loan that went on
 lending, year after year, as much as needful; say, till 1792? The
 trouble of registering such Loan were the same: we had then
 breathing time; money to work with, at least to subsist on. Edict
 of a Successive Loan must be proposed. To conciliate the
 Philosophes, let a liberal Edict walk in front of it, for
 emancipation of Protestants; let a liberal Promise guard the rear
 of it, that when our Loan ends, in that final 1792, the
 States-General shall be convoked. Such liberal Edict of Protestant Emancipation, the time having
 come for it, shall cost a Loménie as little as the
 “Death-penalties to be put in execution” did. As for the liberal
 Promise, of States-General, it can be fulfilled or not: the
 fulfilment is five good years off; in five years much intervenes.
 But the registering? Ah, truly, there is the difficulty!—However,
 we have that promise of the Elders, given secretly at Troyes.
 Judicious gratuities, cajoleries, underground intrigues, with old
 Foulon, named “_Ame damnée_, Familiar-demon, of the Parlement,”
 may perhaps do the rest. At worst and lowest, the Royal Authority
 has resources,—which ought it not to put forth? If it cannot
 realise money, the Royal Authority is as good as dead; dead of
 that surest and miserablest death, inanition. Risk and win;
 without risk all is already lost! For the rest, as in enterprises
 of pith, a touch of stratagem often proves furthersome, his
 Majesty announces _a Royal Hunt_, for the 19th of November next;
 and all whom it concerns are joyfully getting their gear ready. Royal Hunt indeed; but of two-legged unfeathered game! At eleven
 in the morning of that Royal-Hunt day, 19th of November 1787,
 unexpected blare of trumpetting, tumult of charioteering and
 cavalcading disturbs the Seat of Justice: his Majesty is come,
 with Garde-des-Sceaux Lamoignon, and Peers and retinue, to hold
 Royal Session and have Edicts registered. What a change, since
 Louis XIV. entered here, in boots; and, whip in hand, ordered his
 registering to be done,—with an Olympian look which none durst
 gainsay; and did, without stratagem, in such unceremonious
 fashion, hunt as well as register![75] For Louis XVI., on this
 day, the Registering will be enough; if indeed he and the day
 suffice for it. Meanwhile, with fit ceremonial words, the purpose of the royal
 breast is signified:—Two Edicts, for Protestant Emancipation, for
 Successive Loan: of both which Edicts our trusty Garde-des-Sceaux
 Lamoignon will explain the purport; on both which a trusty
 Parlement is requested to deliver its opinion, each member having
 free privilege of speech. And so, Lamoignon too having perorated
 not amiss, and wound up with that Promise of States-General,—the
 Sphere-music of Parlementary eloquence begins. Explosive,
 responsive, sphere answering sphere, it waxes louder and louder.
 The Peers sit attentive; of diverse sentiment: unfriendly to
 States-General; unfriendly to Despotism, which cannot reward
 merit, and is suppressing places. But what agitates his Highness
 d’Orléans? The rubicund moon-head goes wagging; darker beams the
 copper visage, like unscoured copper; in the glazed eye is
 disquietude; he rolls uneasy in his seat, as if he meant
 something. Amid unutterable satiety, has sudden new appetite, for
 new forbidden fruit, been vouchsafed him? Disgust and edacity;
 laziness that cannot rest; futile ambition, revenge,
 non-admiralship:—O, within that carbuncled skin what a confusion
 of confusions sits bottled! “Eight Couriers,” in course of the day, gallop from Versailles,
 where Loménie waits palpitating; and gallop back again, not with
 the best news. In the outer Courts of the Palais, huge buzz of
 expectation reigns; it is whispered the Chief Minister has lost
 six votes overnight. And from within, resounds nothing but
 forensic eloquence, pathetic and even indignant; heartrending
 appeals to the royal clemency, that his Majesty would please to
 summon States-General forthwith, and be the Saviour of
 France:—wherein dusky-glowing D’Espréménil, but still more
 Sabatier de Cabre, and Fréteau, since named _Commère_ Fréteau
 (Goody Fréteau), are among the loudest. For six mortal hours it
 lasts, in this manner; the infinite hubbub unslackened. And so now, when brown dusk is falling through the windows, and
 no end visible, his Majesty, on hint of Garde-des-Sceaux,
 Lamoignon, opens his royal lips once more to say, in brief That
 he must have his Loan-Edict registered.—Momentary deep
 pause!—See! Monseigneur d’Orléans rises; with moon-visage turned
 towards the royal platform, he asks, with a delicate graciosity
 of manner covering unutterable things: ‘Whether it is a Bed of
 Justice, then; or a Royal Session?’ Fire flashes on him from the
 throne and neighbourhood: surly answer that ‘it is a Session.’ In
 that case, Monseigneur will crave leave to remark that Edicts
 cannot be registered by _order_ in a Session; and indeed to
 enter, against such registry, his individual humble Protest.
 ‘_Vous êtes bien le maître_ (You will do your pleasure)’, answers
 the King; and thereupon, in high state, marches out, escorted by
 his Court-retinue; D’Orléans himself, as in duty bound, escorting
 him, but only to the gate. Which duty done, D’Orléans returns in
 from the gate; redacts his Protest, in the face of an applauding
 Parlement, an applauding France; and so—has _cut_ his
 Court-moorings, shall we say? And will now sail and drift, fast
 enough, towards Chaos? Thou foolish D’Orléans; Equality that art to be! Is Royalty grown
 a mere wooden Scarecrow; whereon thou, pert scald-headed crow,
 mayest alight at pleasure, and peck? Not yet wholly. Next day, a Lettre-de-Cachet sends D’Orléans to bethink himself
 in his Château of Villers-Cotterets, where, alas, is no Paris
 with its joyous necessaries of life; no fascinating indispensable
 Madame de Buffon,—light wife of a great Naturalist much too old
 for her. Monseigneur, it is said, does nothing but walk
 distractedly, at Villers-Cotterets; cursing his stars. Versailles
 itself shall hear penitent wail from him, so hard is his doom. By
 a second, simultaneous Lettre-de-Cachet, Goody Fréteau is hurled
 into the Stronghold of Ham, amid the Norman marshes; by a third,
 Sabatier de Cabre into Mont St. Michel, amid the Norman
 quicksands. As for the Parlement, it must, on summons, travel out
 to Versailles, with its Register-Book under its arm, to have the
 Protest _biffé_ (expunged); not without admonition, and even
 rebuke. A stroke of authority which, one might have hoped, would
 quiet matters. Unhappily, no; it is a mere taste of the whip to rearing
 coursers, which makes them rear worse! When a team of Twenty-five
 Millions begins rearing, what is Loménie’s whip? The Parlement
 will nowise acquiesce meekly; and set to register the Protestant
 Edict, and do its other work, in salutary fear of these three
 Lettres-de-Cachet. Far from that, it begins questioning
 Lettres-de-Cachet generally, their legality, endurability; emits
 dolorous objurgation, petition on petition to have its three
 Martyrs delivered; cannot, till that be complied with, so much as
 think of examining the Protestant Edict, but puts it off always
 “till this day week.”[76] In which objurgatory strain Paris and France joins it, or rather
 has preceded it; making fearful chorus. And now also the other
 Parlements, at length opening their mouths, begin to join; some
 of them, as at Grenoble and at Rennes, with portentous
 emphasis,—threatening, by way of reprisal, to interdict the very
 Tax-gatherer.[77] ‘In all former contests,’ as Malesherbes
 remarks, ‘it was the Parlement that excited the Public; but here
 it is the Public that excites the Parlement.’
 Chapter 1.3.VII.
 Internecine. What a France, through these winter months of the year 1787! The
 very Œil-de-Bœuf is doleful, uncertain; with a general feeling
 among the Suppressed, that it were better to be in Turkey. The
 Wolf-hounds are suppressed, the Bear-hounds, Duke de Coigny, Duke
 de Polignac: in the Trianon little-heaven, her Majesty, one
 evening, takes Besenval’s arm; asks his candid opinion. The
 intrepid Besenval,—having, as he hopes, nothing of the sycophant
 in _him_,—plainly signifies that, with a Parlement in rebellion,
 and an Œil-de-Bœuf in suppression, the King’s Crown is in
 danger;—whereupon, singular to say, her Majesty, as if hurt,
 changed the subject, _et ne me parla plus de rien!_[78] To whom, indeed, can this poor Queen speak? In need of wise
 counsel, if ever mortal was; yet beset here only by the hubbub of
 chaos! Her dwelling-place is so bright to the eye, and confusion
 and black care darkens it all. Sorrows of the Sovereign, sorrows
 of the woman, think-coming sorrows environ her more and more.
 Lamotte, the Necklace-Countess, has in these late months escaped,
 perhaps been suffered to escape, from the Salpêtrière. Vain was
 the hope that Paris might thereby forget her; and this
 ever-widening-lie, and heap of lies, subside. The Lamotte, with a
 V (for _Voleuse_, Thief) branded on both shoulders, has got to
 England; and will therefrom emit lie on lie; defiling the highest
 queenly name: mere distracted lies;[79] which, in its present
 humour, France will greedily believe. For the rest, it is too clear our Successive Loan is not filling.
 As indeed, in such circumstances, a Loan registered by expunging
 of Protests was not the likeliest to fill. Denunciation of
 _Lettres-de-Cachet_, of Despotism generally, abates not: the
 Twelve Parlements are busy; the Twelve hundred Placarders,
 Balladsingers, Pamphleteers. Paris is what, in figurative speech,
 they call “flooded with pamphlets (_regorge de brochures_);”
 flooded and eddying again. Hot deluge,—from so many Patriot
 ready-writers, all at the _fervid_ or boiling point; each
 ready-writer, now in the hour of eruption, going like an Iceland
 Geyser! Against which what can a judicious friend Morellet do; a
 Rivarol, an unruly Linguet (well paid for it),—spouting _cold!_ Now also, at length, does come discussion of the Protestant
 Edict: but only for new embroilment; in pamphlet and
 counter-pamphlet, increasing the madness of men. Not even
 Orthodoxy, bedrid as she seemed, but will have a hand in this
 confusion. She, once again in the shape of Abbé Lenfant, “whom
 Prelates drive to visit and congratulate,”—raises audible sound
 from her pulpit-drum.[80] Or mark how D’Espréménil, who has his
 own confused way in all things, produces at the right moment in
 Parlementary harangue, a pocket Crucifix, with the apostrophe:
 ‘Will ye crucify him afresh?’ _Him_, O D’Espréménil, without
 scruple;—considering what poor stuff, of ivory and filigree, _he_
 is made of! To all which add only that poor Brienne has fallen sick; so hard
 was the tear and wear of his sinful youth, so violent, incessant
 is this agitation of his foolish old age. Baited, bayed at
 through so many throats, his Grace, growing consumptive,
 inflammatory (with _humeur de dartre_), lies reduced to milk
 diet; in exasperation, almost in desperation; with “repose,”
 precisely the impossible recipe, prescribed as the
 indispensable.[81] On the whole, what can a poor Government do, but once more recoil
 ineffectual? The King’s Treasury is running towards the lees; and
 Paris “eddies with a flood of pamphlets.” At all rates, let the
 _latter_ subside a little! D’Orléans gets back to Raincy, which
 is nearer Paris and the fair frail Buffon; finally to Paris
 itself: neither are Fréteau and Sabatier banished forever. The
 Protestant Edict is registered; to the joy of Boissy d’Anglas and
 good Malesherbes: Successive Loan, all protests expunged or else
 withdrawn, remains open,—the rather as few or none come to fill
 it. States-General, for which the Parlement has clamoured, and
 now the whole Nation clamours, will follow “in five years,”—if
 indeed not sooner. O Parlement of Paris, what a clamour was that!
 ‘Messieurs,’ said old d’Ormesson, ‘you will get States-General,
 and you will repent it.’ Like the Horse in the Fable, who, to be
 avenged of his enemy, applied to the Man. The Man mounted; did
 swift execution on the enemy; but, unhappily, would not dismount!
 Instead of five years, let three years pass, and this clamorous
 Parlement shall have both seen its enemy hurled prostrate, and
 been itself ridden to foundering (say rather, jugulated for hide
 and shoes), and lie dead in the ditch. Under such omens, however, we have reached the spring of 1788. By
 no path can the King’s Government find passage for itself, but is
 everywhere shamefully flung back. Beleaguered by Twelve
 rebellious Parlements, which are grown to be the organs of an
 angry Nation, it can advance nowhither; can accomplish nothing,
 obtain nothing, not so much as money to subsist on; but must sit
 there, seemingly, to be eaten up of Deficit. The measure of the Iniquity, then, of the Falsehood which has
 been gathering through long centuries, is nearly full? At least,
 that of the misery is! For the hovels of the Twenty-five
 Millions, the misery, permeating upwards and forwards, as its law
 is, has got so far,—to the very Œil-de-Bœuf of Versailles. Man’s
 hand, in this blind pain, is set against man: not only the low
 against the higher, but the higher against each other; Provincial
 Noblesse is bitter against Court Noblesse; Robe against Sword;
 Rochet against Pen. But against the King’s Government who is not
 bitter? Not even Besenval, in these days. To it all men and
 bodies of men are become as enemies; it is the centre whereon
 infinite contentions unite and clash. What new universal
 vertiginous movement is this; of Institution, social
 Arrangements, individual Minds, which once worked cooperative;
 now rolling and grinding in distracted collision? Inevitable: it
 is the breaking-up of a World-Solecism, worn out at last, down
 even to bankruptcy of money! And so this poor Versailles Court,
 as the chief or central Solecism, finds all the other Solecisms
 arrayed against it. Most natural! For your human Solecism, be it
 Person or Combination of Persons, is ever, by law of Nature,
 uneasy; if verging towards bankruptcy, it is even miserable:—and
 when would the meanest Solecism consent to blame or amend
 _itself_, while there remained another to amend? These threatening signs do not terrify Loménie, much less teach
 him. Loménie, though of light nature, is not without courage, of
 a sort. Nay, have we not read of lightest creatures, trained
 Canary-birds, that could fly cheerfully with lighted matches, and
 fire cannon; fire whole powder-magazines? To sit and die of
 deficit is no part of Loménie’s plan. The evil is considerable;
 but can he not remove it, can he not attack it? At lowest, he can
 attack the _symptom_ of it: these rebellious Parlements he can
 attack, and perhaps remove. Much is dim to Loménie, but two
 things are clear: that such Parlementary duel with Royalty is
 growing perilous, nay internecine; above all, that money must be
 had. Take thought, brave Loménie; thou Garde-des-Sceaux
 Lamoignon, who hast ideas! So often defeated, balked cruelly when
 the golden fruit seemed within clutch, rally for one other
 struggle. To tame the Parlement, to fill the King’s coffers:
 these are now life-and-death questions. Parlements have been tamed, more than once. Set to perch “on the
 peaks of rocks in accessible except by litters,” a Parlement
 grows reasonable. O Maupeou, thou bold man, had we left thy work
 where it was!—But apart from exile, or other violent methods, is
 there not one method, whereby all things are tamed, even lions?
 The method of hunger! What if the Parlement’s supplies were cut
 off; namely its Lawsuits! Minor Courts, for the trying of innumerable minor causes, might
 be instituted: these we could call _Grand Bailliages_. Whereon
 the Parlement, shortened of its prey, would look with yellow
 despair; but the Public, fond of cheap justice, with favour and
 hope. Then for Finance, for registering of Edicts, why not, from
 our own Œil-de-Bœuf Dignitaries, our Princes, Dukes, Marshals,
 make a thing we could call _Plenary Court_; and there, so to
 speak, do our registering ourselves? St. Louis had his Plenary
 Court, of Great Barons;[82] most useful to him: our Great Barons
 are still here (at least the Name of them is still here); our
 necessity is greater than his. Such is the Loménie-Lamoignon device; welcome to the King’s
 Council, as a light-beam in great darkness. The device seems
 feasible, it is eminently needful: be it once well executed,
 great deliverance is wrought. Silent, then, and steady; now or
 never!—the World shall see one other Historical Scene; and so
 singular a man as Loménie de Brienne still the Stage-manager
 there. Behold, accordingly, a Home-Secretary Bréteuil “beautifying
 Paris,” in the peaceablest manner, in this hopeful spring weather
 of 1788; the old hovels and hutches disappearing from our
 Bridges: as if for the State too there were halcyon weather, and
 nothing to do but beautify. Parlement seems to sit acknowledged
 victor. Brienne says nothing of Finance; or even says, and
 prints, that it is all well. How is this; such halcyon quiet;
 though the Successive Loan did not fill? In a victorious
 Parlement, Counsellor Goeslard de Monsabert even denounces that
 “levying of the Second Twentieth on strict valuation;” and gets
 decree that the valuation shall not be strict,—not on the
 privileged classes. Nevertheless Brienne endures it, launches no
 Lettre-de-Cachet against it. How is this? Smiling is such vernal weather; but treacherous, sudden! For one
 thing, we hear it whispered, “the Intendants of Provinces have
 all got order to be at their posts on a certain day.” Still more
 singular, what incessant Printing is this that goes on at the
 King’s Château, under lock and key? Sentries occupy all gates and
 windows; the Printers come not out; they sleep in their
 workrooms; their very food is handed in to them![83] A victorious
 Parlement smells new danger. D’Espréménil has ordered horses to
 Versailles; prowls round that guarded Printing-Office; prying,
 snuffing, if so be the sagacity and ingenuity of man may
 penetrate it. To a shower of gold most things are penetrable. D’Espréménil
 descends on the lap of a Printer’s Danae, in the shape of “five
 hundred louis d’or:” the Danae’s Husband smuggles a ball of clay
 to her; which she delivers to the golden Counsellor of Parlement.
 Kneaded within it, their stick printed proof-sheets;—by Heaven!
 the royal Edict of that same self-registering _Plenary Court;_ of
 those _Grand Bailliages_ that shall cut short our Lawsuits! It is
 to be promulgated over all France on one and the same day. This, then, is what the Intendants were bid wait for at their
 posts: this is what the Court sat hatching, as its accursed
 cockatrice-egg; and would not stir, though provoked, till the
 brood were out! Hie with it, D’Espréménil, home to Paris; convoke
 instantaneous Sessions; let the Parlement, and the Earth, and the
 Heavens know it.
 Chapter 1.3.VIII.
 Loménie’s Death-throes. On the morrow, which is the 3rd of May, 1788, an astonished
 Parlement sits convoked; listens speechless to the speech of
 D’Espréménil, unfolding the infinite misdeed. Deed of treachery;
 of unhallowed darkness, such as Despotism loves! Denounce it, O
 Parlement of Paris; awaken France and the Universe; roll what
 thunder-barrels of forensic eloquence thou hast: with thee too it
 is verily Now or never! The Parlement is not wanting, at such juncture. In the hour of
 his extreme jeopardy, the lion first incites himself by roaring,
 by lashing his sides. So here the Parlement of Paris. On the
 motion of D’Espréménil, a most patriotic Oath, of the One-and-all
 sort, is sworn, with united throat;—an excellent new-idea, which,
 in these coming years, shall not remain unimitated. Next comes
 indomitable Declaration, almost of the rights of man, at least of
 the rights of Parlement; Invocation to the friends of French
 Freedom, in this and in subsequent time. All which, or the
 essence of all which, is brought to paper; in a tone wherein
 something of plaintiveness blends with, and tempers, heroic
 valour. And thus, having sounded the storm-bell,—which Paris
 hears, which all France will hear; and hurled such defiance in
 the teeth of Loménie and Despotism, the Parlement retires as from
 a tolerable first day’s work. But how Loménie felt to see his cockatrice-egg (so essential to
 the salvation of France) broken in this premature manner, let
 readers fancy! Indignant he clutches at his thunderbolts (_de
 Cachet_, of the Seal); and launches two of them: a bolt for
 D’Espréménil; a bolt for that busy Goeslard, whose service in the
 Second Twentieth and “strict valuation” is not forgotten. Such
 bolts clutched promptly overnight, and launched with the early
 new morning, shall strike agitated Paris if not into
 requiescence, yet into wholesome astonishment. Ministerial thunderbolts may be launched; but if they do not
 _hit?_ D’Espréménil and Goeslard, warned, both of them, as is
 thought, by the singing of some friendly bird, elude the Loménie
 Tipstaves; escape disguised through skywindows, over roofs, to
 their own Palais de Justice: the thunderbolts have _missed_.
 Paris (for the buzz flies abroad) is struck into astonishment
 _not_ wholesome. The two martyrs of Liberty doff their disguises;
 don their long gowns; behold, in the space of an hour, by aid of
 ushers and swift runners, the Parlement, with its Counsellors,
 Presidents, even Peers, sits anew assembled. The assembled
 Parlement declares that these its two martyrs cannot be given up,
 to any sublunary authority; moreover that the “session is
 permanent,” admitting of no adjournment, till pursuit of them has
 been relinquished. And so, with forensic eloquence, denunciation and protest, with
 couriers going and returning, the Parlement, in this state of
 continual explosion that shall cease neither night nor day, waits
 the issue. Awakened Paris once more inundates those outer courts;
 boils, in floods wilder than ever, through all avenues. Dissonant
 hubbub there is; jargon as of Babel, in the hour when they were
 first smitten (as here) with mutual unintelligibilty, and the
 people had not yet dispersed! Paris City goes through its diurnal epochs, of working and
 slumbering; and now, for the second time, most European and
 African mortals are asleep. But here, in this Whirlpool of Words,
 sleep falls not; the Night spreads her coverlid of Darkness over
 it in vain. Within is the sound of mere martyr invincibility;
 tempered with the due tone of plaintiveness. Without is the
 infinite expectant hum,—growing drowsier a little. So has it
 lasted for six-and-thirty hours. But hark, through the dead of midnight, what tramp is this? Tramp
 as of armed men, foot and horse; Gardes Françaises, Gardes
 Suisses: marching hither; in silent regularity; in the flare of
 torchlight! There are Sappers, too, with axes and crowbars:
 apparently, if the doors open not, they will be forced!—It is
 Captain D’Agoust, missioned from Versailles. D’Agoust, a man of
 known firmness;—who once forced Prince Condé himself, by mere
 incessant looking at him, to give satisfaction and fight;[84] he
 now, with axes and torches is advancing on the very sanctuary of
 Justice. Sacrilegious; yet what help? The man is a soldier; looks
 merely at his orders; impassive, moves forward like an inanimate
 engine. The doors open on summons, there need no axes; door after door.
 And now the innermost door opens; discloses the long-gowned
 Senators of France: a hundred and sixty-seven by tale, seventeen
 of them Peers; sitting there, majestic, “in permanent session.”
 Were not the men military, and of cast-iron, this sight, this
 silence reechoing the clank of his own boots, might stagger him!
 For the hundred and sixty-seven receive him in perfect silence;
 which some liken to that of the Roman Senate overfallen by
 Brennus; some to that of a nest of coiners surprised by officers
 of the Police.[85] _Messieurs_, said D’Agoust, _De par le Roi!_
 Express order has charged D’Agoust with the sad duty of arresting
 two individuals: M. Duval d’Espréménil and M. Goeslard de
 Monsabert. Which respectable individuals, as he has not the
 honour of knowing them, are hereby invited, in the King’s name,
 to surrender themselves.—Profound silence! Buzz, which grows a
 murmur: ‘We are all D’Espréménils!’ ventures a voice; which other
 voices repeat. The President inquires, Whether he will employ
 violence? Captain D’Agoust, honoured with his Majesty’s
 commission, has to execute his Majesty’s order; would so gladly
 do it without violence, will in any case do it; grants an august
 Senate space to deliberate which method _they_ prefer. And
 thereupon D’Agoust, with grave military courtesy, has withdrawn
 for the moment. What boots it, august Senators? All avenues are closed with fixed
 bayonets. Your Courier gallops to Versailles, through the dewy
 Night; but also gallops back again, with tidings that the order
 is authentic, that it is irrevocable. The outer courts simmer
 with idle population; but D’Agoust’s grenadier-ranks stand there
 as immovable floodgates: there will be no revolting to deliver
 you. ‘Messieurs!’ thus spoke D’Espréménil, ‘when the victorious
 Gauls entered Rome, which they had carried by assault, the Roman
 Senators, clothed in their purple, sat there, in their curule
 chairs, with a proud and tranquil countenance, awaiting slavery
 or death. Such too is the lofty spectacle, which you, in this
 hour, offer to the universe (_à l’univers_), after having
 generously’—with much more of the like, as can still be read.[86] In vain, O D’Espréménil! Here is this cast-iron Captain D’Agoust,
 with his cast-iron military air, come back. Despotism,
 constraint, destruction sit waving in his plumes. D’Espréménil
 must fall silent; heroically give himself up, lest worst befall.
 Him Goeslard heroically imitates. With spoken and speechless
 emotion, they fling themselves into the arms of their
 Parlementary brethren, for a last embrace: and so amid plaudits
 and plaints, from a hundred and sixty-five throats; amid wavings,
 sobbings, a whole forest-sigh of Parlementary pathos,—they are
 led through winding passages, to the rear-gate; where, in the
 gray of the morning, two Coaches with _Exempts_ stand waiting.
 There must the victims mount; bayonets menacing behind.
 D’Espréménil’s stern question to the populace, “Whether they have
 courage?” is answered by silence. They mount, and roll; and
 neither the rising of the May sun (it is the 6th morning), nor
 its setting shall lighten their heart: but they fare forward
 continually; D’Espréménil towards the utmost Isles of Sainte
 Marguerite, or Hieres (supposed by some, if that is any comfort,
 to be Calypso’s Island); Goeslard towards the land-fortress of
 Pierre-en-Cize, extant then, near the City of Lyons. Captain D’Agoust may now therefore look forward to Majorship, to
 Commandantship of the Tuilleries;[87]—and withal vanish from
 History; where nevertheless he has been fated to do a notable
 thing. For not only are D’Espréménil and Goeslard safe whirling
 southward, but the Parlement itself has straightway to march out:
 to that also his inexorable order reaches. Gathering up their
 long skirts, they file out, the whole Hundred and Sixty-five of
 them, through two rows of unsympathetic grenadiers: a spectacle
 to gods and men. The people revolt not; they only wonder and
 grumble: also, we remark, these unsympathetic grenadiers are
 _Gardes Françaises_,—who, one day, will sympathise! In a word,
 the Palais de Justice is swept clear, the doors of it are locked;
 and D’Agoust returns to Versailles with the key in his
 pocket,—having, as was said, merited preferment. As for this Parlement of Paris, now turned out to the street, we
 will without reluctance leave it there. The Beds of Justice it
 had to undergo, in the coming fortnight, at Versailles, in
 registering, or rather refusing to register, those new-hatched
 Edicts; and how it assembled in taverns and tap-rooms there, for
 the purpose of Protesting,[88] or hovered disconsolate, with
 outspread skirts, not knowing where to assemble; and was reduced
 to lodge Protest “with a Notary;” and in the end, to sit still
 (in a state of forced “vacation”), and do nothing; all this,
 natural now, as the burying of the dead after battle, shall not
 concern us. The Parlement of Paris has as good as performed its
 part; doing and misdoing, so far, but hardly further, could it
 stir the world. Loménie has removed the evil then? Not at all: not so much as the
 symptom of the evil; scarcely the _twelfth_ part of the symptom,
 and exasperated the other eleven! The Intendants of Provinces,
 the Military Commandants are at their posts, on the appointed 8th
 of May: but in no Parlement, if not in the single one of Douai,
 can these new Edicts get registered. Not peaceable signing with
 ink; but browbeating, bloodshedding, appeal to primary club-law!
 Against these Bailliages, against this Plenary Court, exasperated
 Themis everywhere shows face of battle; the Provincial Noblesse
 are of her party, and whoever hates Loménie and the evil time;
 with her attorneys and Tipstaves, she enlists and operates down
 even to the populace. At Rennes in Brittany, where the historical
 Bertrand de Moleville is Intendant, it has passed from fatal
 continual duelling, between the military and gentry, to
 street-fighting; to stone-volleys and musket-shot: and still the
 Edicts remained unregistered. The afflicted Bretons send
 remonstrance to Loménie, by a Deputation of Twelve; whom,
 however, Loménie, having heard them, shuts up in the Bastille. A
 second larger deputation he meets, by his scouts, on the road,
 and persuades or frightens back. But now a third largest
 Deputation is indignantly sent by _many_ roads: refused audience
 on arriving, it meets to take council; invites Lafayette and all
 Patriot Bretons in Paris to assist; agitates itself; becomes the
 _Breton Club_, first germ of—the _Jacobins’ Society._[89]');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' So many as eight Parlements get exiled:[90] others might need
 that remedy, but it is one not always easy of appliance. At
 Grenoble, for instance, where a Mounier, a Barnave have not been
 idle, the Parlement had due order (by _Lettres-de-Cachet_) to
 depart, and exile itself: but on the morrow, instead of coaches
 getting yoked, the alarm-bell bursts forth, ominous; and peals
 and booms all day: crowds of mountaineers rush down, with axes,
 even with firelocks,—whom (most ominous of all!) the soldiery
 shows no eagerness to deal with. “Axe over head,” the poor
 General has to sign capitulation; to engage that the
 _Lettres-de-Cachet_ shall remain unexecuted, and a beloved
 Parlement stay where it is. Besancon, Dijon, Rouen, Bourdeaux,
 are not what they should be! At Pau in Bearn, where the old
 Commandant had failed, the new one (a Grammont, native to them)
 is met by a Procession of townsmen with the Cradle of Henri
 Quatre, the Palladium of their Town; is conjured as he venerates
 this old Tortoise-shell, in which the great Henri was rocked, not
 to trample on Bearnese liberty; is informed, withal, that his
 Majesty’s cannon are all safe—in the keeping of his Majesty’s
 faithful Burghers of Pau, and do now lie pointed on the walls
 there; ready for action![91] At this rate, your Grand Bailliages are like to have a stormy
 infancy. As for the Plenary Court, it has literally expired in
 the birth. The very Courtiers looked shy at it; old Marshal
 Broglie declined the honour of sitting therein. Assaulted by a
 universal storm of mingled ridicule and execration,[92] this poor
 Plenary Court met once, and never any second time. Distracted
 country! Contention hisses up, with forked hydra-tongues,
 wheresoever poor Loménie sets his foot. “Let a Commandant, a
 Commissioner of the King,” says Weber, “enter one of these
 Parlements to have an Edict registered, the whole Tribunal will
 disappear, and leave the Commandant alone with the Clerk and
 First President. The Edict registered and the Commandant gone,
 the whole Tribunal hastens back, to declare such registration
 null. The highways are covered with _Grand Deputations_ of
 Parlements, proceeding to Versailles, to have their registers
 expunged by the King’s hand; or returning home, to cover a new
 page with a new resolution still more audacious.”[93] Such is the France of this year 1788. Not now a Golden or Paper
 Age of Hope; with its horse-racings, balloon-flyings, and finer
 sensibilities of the heart: ah, gone is that; its golden
 effulgence paled, bedarkened in _this_ singular manner,—brewing
 towards preternatural weather! For, as in that wreck-storm of
 _Paul et Virginie_ and Saint-Pierre,—“One huge motionless cloud”
 (say, of Sorrow and Indignation) “girdles our whole horizon;
 streams up, hairy, copper-edged, over a sky of the colour of
 lead.” Motionless itself; but “small clouds” (as exiled
 Parlements and suchlike), “parting from it, fly over the zenith,
 with the velocity of birds:”—till at last, with one loud howl,
 the whole Four Winds be dashed together, and all the world
 exclaim, There is the tornado! _Tout le monde s’écria, Voilà
 l’ouragan!_ For the rest, in such circumstances, the Successive Loan, very
 naturally, remains unfilled; neither, indeed, can that impost of
 the Second Twentieth, at least not on “strict valuation,” be
 levied to good purpose: “Lenders,” says Weber, in his hysterical
 vehement manner, “are afraid of ruin; tax-gatherers of hanging.”
 The very Clergy turn away their face: convoked in Extraordinary
 Assembly, they afford no gratuitous gift (_don gratuit_),—if it
 be not that of advice; here too instead of cash is clamour for
 States-General.[94] O Loménie-Brienne, with thy poor flimsy mind all bewildered, and
 now “three actual cauteries” on thy worn-out body; who art like
 to die of inflamation, provocation, milk-diet, _dartres vives_
 and _maladie_—(best untranslated);[95] and presidest over a
 France with innumerable _actual cauteries_, which also is dying
 of inflammation and the rest! Was it wise to quit the bosky
 verdures of Brienne, and thy new ashlar Château there, and what
 it held, for _this?_ Soft were those shades and lawns; sweet the
 hymns of Poetasters, the blandishments of high-rouged Graces:[96]
 and always this and the other Philosophe Morellet (nothing
 deeming himself or thee a questionable Sham-Priest) could be so
 happy in making happy:—and also (hadst thou known it), in the
 Military School hard by there sat, studying mathematics, a
 dusky-complexioned taciturn Boy, under the name of: NAPOLEON
 BONAPARTE!—With fifty years of effort, and one final dead-lift
 struggle, thou hast made an exchange! Thou hast got thy robe of
 office,—as Hercules had his Nessus’-shirt. On the 13th of July of this 1788, there fell, on the very edge of
 harvest, the most frightful hailstorm; scattering into wild waste
 the Fruits of the Year; which had otherwise suffered grievously
 by drought. For sixty leagues round Paris especially, the ruin
 was almost total.[97] To so many other evils, then, there is to
 be added, that of dearth, perhaps of famine. Some days before this hailstorm, on the 5th of July; and still
 more decisively some days after it, on the 8th of August,—Loménie
 announces that the States-General are actually to meet in the
 following month of May. Till after which period, this of the
 Plenary Court, and the rest, shall remain _postponed_. Further,
 as in Loménie there is no plan of forming or holding these most
 desirable States-General, “thinkers are invited” to furnish him
 with one,—through the medium of discussion by the public press! What could a poor Minister do? There are still ten months of
 respite reserved: a sinking pilot will fling out all things, his
 very biscuit-bags, lead, log, compass and quadrant, before
 flinging out _himself_. It is on this principle, of sinking, and
 the incipient delirium of despair, that we explain likewise the
 almost miraculous “invitation to thinkers.” Invitation to Chaos
 to be so kind as build, out of its tumultuous drift-wood, an Ark
 of Escape for him! In these cases, not invitation but command has
 usually proved serviceable.—The Queen stood, that evening,
 pensive, in a window, with her face turned towards the Garden.
 The _Chef de Gobelet_ had followed her with an obsequious cup of
 coffee; and then retired till it were sipped. Her Majesty
 beckoned Dame Campan to approach: ‘_Grand Dieu!_’ murmured she,
 with the cup in her hand, ‘what a piece of news will be made
 public today! The King grants States-General.’ Then raising her
 eyes to Heaven (if Campan were not mistaken), she added: ‘’Tis a
 first beat of the drum, of ill-omen for France. This Noblesse
 will ruin us.’[98] During all that hatching of the Plenary Court, while Lamoignon
 looked so mysterious, Besenval had kept asking him one question:
 Whether they had cash? To which as Lamoignon always answered (on
 the faith of Loménie) that the cash was safe, judicious Besenval
 rejoined that then all was safe. Nevertheless, the melancholy
 fact is, that the royal coffers are almost getting literally void
 of coin. Indeed, apart from all other things this “invitation to
 thinkers,” and the great change now at hand are enough to “arrest
 the circulation of capital,” and forward only that of pamphlets.
 A few thousand gold louis are now all of money or money’s worth
 that remains in the King’s Treasury. With another movement as of
 desperation, Loménie invites Necker to come and be Controller of
 Finances! Necker has other work in view than controlling Finances
 for Loménie: with a dry refusal he stands taciturn; awaiting his
 time. What shall a desperate Prime Minister do? He has grasped at the
 strongbox of the King’s Theatre: some Lottery had been set on
 foot for those sufferers by the hailstorm; in his extreme
 necessity, Loménie lays hands even on this.[99] To make provision
 for the passing day, on any terms, will soon be impossible.—On
 the 16th of August, poor Weber heard, at Paris and Versailles,
 hawkers, “with a hoarse stifled tone of voice (_voix étouffée,
 sourde_)” drawling and snuffling, through the streets, an _Edict
 concerning Payments_ (such was the soft title Rivarol had
 contrived for it): all payments at the Royal Treasury shall be
 made henceforth, three-fifths in Cash, and the remaining
 two-fifths—in Paper bearing interest! Poor Weber almost swooned
 at the sound of these cracked voices, with their bodeful
 raven-note; and will never forget the effect it had on him.[100] But the effect on Paris, on the world generally? From the dens of
 Stock-brokerage, from the heights of Political Economy, of
 Neckerism and Philosophism; from all articulate and inarticulate
 throats, rise hootings and howlings, such as ear had not yet
 heard. Sedition itself may be imminent! Monseigneur d’Artois,
 moved by Duchess Polignac, feels called to wait upon her Majesty;
 and explain frankly what crisis matters stand in. “The Queen
 wept;” Brienne himself wept;—for it is now visible and palpable
 that he must go. Remains only that the Court, to whom his manners and garrulities
 were always agreeable, shall make his fall soft. The grasping old
 man has already got his Archbishopship of Toulouse exchanged for
 the richer one of Sens: and now, in this hour of pity, he shall
 have the Coadjutorship for his nephew (hardly yet of due age); a
 Dameship of the Palace for his niece; a Regiment for her husband;
 for himself a red Cardinal’s-hat, a _Coupe de Bois_ (cutting from
 the royal forests), and on the whole “from five to six hundred
 thousand livres of revenue:”[101] finally, his Brother, the Comte
 de Brienne, shall still continue War-minister. Buckled-round with
 such bolsters and huge featherbeds of Promotion, let him now fall
 as soft as he can! And so Loménie departs: rich if Court-titles and Money-bonds can
 enrich him; but if these cannot, perhaps the poorest of all
 extant men. “Hissed at by the people of Versailles,” he drives
 forth to Jardi; southward to Brienne,—for recovery of health.
 Then to Nice, to Italy; but shall return; shall glide to and fro,
 tremulous, faint-twinkling, fallen on awful times: till the
 Guillotine—snuff out his weak existence? Alas, worse: for it is
 _blown_ out, or choked out, foully, pitiably, on the way to the
 Guillotine! In his Palace of Sens, rude Jacobin Bailiffs made him
 drink with them from his own wine-cellars, feast with them from
 his own larder; and on the morrow morning, the miserable old man
 lies dead. This is the end of Prime Minister, Cardinal Archbishop
 Loménie de Brienne. Flimsier mortal was seldom fated to do as
 weighty a mischief; to have a life as despicable-envied, an exit
 as frightful. _Fired_, as the phrase is, with ambition: blown,
 like a kindled rag, the sport of winds, not this way, not that
 way, but of all ways, straight towards _such_ a
 powder-mine,—which he kindled! Let us pity the hapless Loménie;
 and forgive him; and, as soon as possible, forget him.
 Chapter 1.3.IX.
 Burial with Bonfire. Besenval, during these extraordinary operations, of Payment
 two-fifths in Paper, and change of Prime Minister, had been out
 on a tour through his District of Command; and indeed, for the
 last months, peacefully drinking the waters of Contrexeville.
 Returning now, in the end of August, towards Moulins, and
 “knowing nothing,” he arrives one evening at Langres; finds the
 whole Town in a state of uproar (_grande rumeur_). Doubtless some
 sedition; a thing too common in these days! He alights
 nevertheless; inquires of a “man tolerably dressed,” what the
 matter is?—‘How?’ answers the man, ‘you have not heard the news?
 The Archbishop is thrown out, and M. Necker is recalled; and all
 is going to go well!’[102] Such _rumeur_ and vociferous acclaim has risen round M. Necker,
 ever from “that day when he issued from the Queen’s Apartments,”
 a nominated Minister. It was on the 24th of August: “the
 galleries of the Château, the courts, the streets of Versailles;
 in few hours, the Capital; and, as the news flew, all France,
 resounded with the cry of _Vive le Roi! Vive M. Necker!_[103] In
 Paris indeed it unfortunately got the length of turbulence.”
 Petards, rockets go off, in the Place Dauphine, more than enough.
 A “wicker Figure (_Mannequin d’osier_),” in Archbishop’s stole,
 made emblematically, three-fifths of it satin, two-fifths of it
 paper, is promenaded, not in silence, to the popular
 judgment-bar; is doomed; shriven by a mock Abbé de Vermond; then
 solemnly consumed by fire, at the foot of Henri’s Statue on the
 Pont Neuf;—with such petarding and huzzaing that Chevalier Dubois
 and his City-watch see good finally to make a charge (more or
 less ineffectual); and there wanted not burning of sentry-boxes,
 forcing of guard-houses, and also “dead bodies thrown into the
 Seine over-night,” to avoid new effervescence.[104] Parlements therefore shall return from exile: Plenary Court,
 Payment two-fifths in Paper have vanished; gone off in smoke, at
 the foot of Henri’s Statue. States-General (with a Political
 Millennium) are now certain; nay, it shall be announced, in our
 fond haste, for January next: and all, as the Langres man said,
 is “going to go.” To the prophetic glance of Besenval, one other thing is too
 apparent: that Friend Lamoignon cannot keep his Keepership.
 Neither he nor War-minister Comte de Brienne! Already old Foulon,
 with an eye to be war-minister himself, is making underground
 movements. This is that same Foulon named _âme damnée du
 Parlement;_ a man grown gray in treachery, in griping,
 projecting, intriguing and iniquity: who once when it was
 objected, to some finance-scheme of his, ‘What will the people
 do?’—made answer, in the fire of discussion, ‘The people may eat
 grass:’ hasty words, which fly abroad irrevocable,—and will send
 back tidings! Foulon, to the relief of the world, fails on this occasion; and
 will always fail. Nevertheless it steads not M. de Lamoignon. It
 steads not the doomed man that he have interviews with the King;
 and be “seen to return _radieux_,” emitting _rays_. Lamoignon is
 the hated of Parlements: Comte de Brienne is Brother to the
 Cardinal Archbishop. The 24th of August has been; and the 14th
 September is not yet, when they two, as their great Principal had
 done, descend,—made to fall _soft_, like him. And now, as if the last burden had been rolled from its heart,
 and assurance were at length perfect, Paris bursts forth anew
 into extreme jubilee. The Basoche rejoices aloud, that the foe of
 Parlements is fallen; Nobility, Gentry, Commonalty have rejoiced;
 and rejoice. Nay now, with new emphasis, Rascality itself,
 starting suddenly from its dim depths, will arise and do it,—for
 down even thither the new Political Evangel, in some rude version
 or other, has penetrated. It is Monday, the 14th of September
 1788: Rascality assembles anew, in great force, in the Place
 Dauphine; lets off petards, fires blunderbusses, to an incredible
 extent, without interval, for eighteen hours. There is again a
 wicker Figure, “_Mannequin_ of osier:” the centre of endless
 howlings. Also Necker’s Portrait snatched, or purchased, from
 some Printshop, is borne processionally, aloft on a perch, with
 huzzas;—an example to be remembered. But chiefly on the Pont Neuf, where the Great Henri, in bronze,
 rides sublime; there do the crowds gather. All passengers must
 stop, till they have bowed to the People’s King, and said
 audibly: _Vive Henri Quatre; au diable Lamoignon!_ No carriage
 but must stop; not even that of his Highness d’Orléans. Your
 coach-doors are opened: Monsieur will please to put forth his
 head and bow; or even, if refractory, to alight altogether, and
 kneel: from Madame a wave of her plumes, a smile of her fair
 face, there where she sits, shall suffice;—and surely a coin or
 two (to buy _fusées_) were not unreasonable from the Upper
 Classes, friends of Liberty? In this manner it proceeds for days;
 in such rude horse-play,—not without kicks. The City-watch can do
 nothing; hardly save its own skin: for the last twelve-month, as
 we have sometimes seen, it has been a kind of pastime to _hunt_
 the Watch. Besenval indeed is at hand with soldiers; but they
 have orders to avoid firing, and are not prompt to stir. On Monday morning the explosion of petards began: and now it is
 near midnight of Wednesday; and the “wicker _Mannequin_” is to be
 buried,—apparently in the Antique fashion. Long rows of torches,
 following it, move towards the Hôtel Lamoignon; but “a servant of
 mine” (Besenval’s) has run to give warning, and there are
 soldiers come. Gloomy Lamoignon is not to die by conflagration,
 or this night; not yet for a year, and then by gunshot (suicidal
 or accidental is unknown).[105] Foiled Rascality burns its
 “Mannikin of osier,” under his windows; “tears up the
 sentry-box,” and rolls off: to try Brienne; to try Dubois Captain
 of the Watch. Now, however, all is bestirring itself; Gardes
 Françaises, Invalides, Horse-patrol: the Torch Procession is met
 with sharp shot, with the thrusting of bayonets, the slashing of
 sabres. Even Dubois makes a charge, with that Cavalry of his, and
 the cruelest charge of all: “there are a great many killed and
 wounded.” Not without clangour, complaint; subsequent criminal
 trials, and official persons dying of heartbreak![106] So,
 however, with steel-besom, Rascality is brushed back into its dim
 depths, and the streets are swept clear. Not for a century and half had Rascality ventured to step forth
 in this fashion; not for so long, showed its huge rude lineaments
 in the light of day. A Wonder and new Thing: as yet gamboling
 merely, in awkward Brobdingnag sport, not without quaintness;
 hardly in anger: yet in its huge half-vacant laugh lurks a shade
 of grimness,—which could unfold itself! However, the thinkers invited by Loménie are now far on with
 their pamphlets: States-General, on one plan or another, will
 infallibly meet; if not in January, as was once hoped, yet at
 latest in May. Old Duke de Richelieu, moribund in these autumn
 days, opens his eyes once more, murmuring, ‘What would Louis
 Fourteenth’ (whom he remembers) ‘have said!’—then closes them
 again, forever, before the evil time.
 BOOK 1.IV.
 STATES-GENERAL
 Chapter 1.4.I.
 The Notables Again. The universal prayer, therefore, is to be fulfilled! Always in
 days of national perplexity, when wrong abounded and help was
 not, this remedy of States-General was called for; by a
 Malesherbes, nay by a Fénelon;[107] even Parlements calling for
 it were “escorted with blessings.” And now behold it is
 vouchsafed us; States-General shall verily be! To say, let States-General be, was easy; to say in what manner
 they shall be, is not so easy. Since the year of 1614, there have
 no States-General met in France, all trace of them has vanished
 from the living habits of men. Their structure, powers, methods
 of procedure, which were never in any measure fixed, have now
 become wholly a vague possibility. Clay which the potter may
 shape, this way or that:—say rather, the twenty-five millions of
 potters; for so many have now, more or less, a vote in it! How to
 shape the States-General? There is a problem. Each
 Body-corporate, each privileged, each organised Class has secret
 hopes of its own in that matter; and also secret misgivings of
 its own,—for, behold, this monstrous twenty-million Class,
 hitherto the dumb sheep which these others had to agree about the
 manner of shearing, is now also arising with hopes! It has ceased
 or is ceasing to be dumb; it speaks through Pamphlets, or at
 least brays and growls behind them, in unison,—increasing
 wonderfully their volume of sound. As for the Parlement of Paris, it has at once declared for the
 “old form of 1614.” Which form had this advantage, that the
 _Tiers Etat_, Third Estate, or Commons, figured there as a show
 mainly: whereby the Noblesse and Clergy had but to avoid quarrel
 between themselves, and decide unobstructed what _they_ thought
 best. Such was the clearly declared opinion of the Paris
 Parlement. But, being met by a storm of mere hooting and howling
 from all men, such opinion was blown straightway to the winds;
 and the popularity of the Parlement along with it,—never to
 return. The Parlements part, we said above, was as good as
 played. Concerning which, however, there is this further to be
 noted: the proximity of dates. It was on the 22nd of September
 that the Parlement returned from “vacation” or “exile in its
 estates;” to be reinstalled amid boundless jubilee from all
 Paris. Precisely next day it was, that this same Parlement came
 to its “clearly declared opinion:” and then on the morrow after
 that, you behold it “covered with outrages”; its outer court, one
 vast sibilation, and the glory departed from it for
 evermore.[108] A popularity of twenty-four hours was, in those
 times, no uncommon allowance. On the other hand, how superfluous was that invitation of
 Loménie’s: the invitation to thinkers! Thinkers and unthinkers,
 by the million, are spontaneously at their post, doing what is in
 them. Clubs labour: _Societe Publicole;_ Breton Club; Enraged
 Club, _Club des Enrages_. Likewise Dinner-parties in the Palais
 Royal; your Mirabeaus, Talleyrands dining there, in company with
 Chamforts, Morellets, with Duponts and hot Parlementeers, not
 without object! For a certain _Necker_ean Lion’s-provider, whom
 one could name, assembles them there;[109]—or even their own
 private determination to have dinner does it. And then as to
 Pamphlets—in figurative language; “it is a sheer snowing of
 pamphlets; like to snow up the Government thoroughfares!” Now is
 the time for Friends of Freedom; sane, and even insane. Count, or self-styled Count, d’Aintrigues, “the young
 Languedocian gentleman,” with perhaps Chamfort the Cynic to help
 him, rises into furor almost Pythic; highest, where many are
 high.[110] Foolish young Languedocian gentleman; who himself so
 soon, “emigrating among the foremost,” must fly indignant over
 the marches, with the _Contrat Social_ in his pocket,—towards
 outer darkness, thankless intriguings, _ignis-fatuus_ hoverings,
 and death by the stiletto! Abbé Sieyes has left Chartres
 Cathedral, and canonry and book-shelves there; has let his
 tonsure grow, and come to Paris with a secular head, of the most
 irrefragable sort, to ask three questions, and answer them: _What
 is the Third Estate? All.—What has it hitherto been in our form
 of government? Nothing.—What does it want? To become Something._ D’Orléans,—for be sure he, on his way to Chaos, is in the thick
 of this,—promulgates his _Deliberations;_[111] fathered by him,
 written by Laclos of the _Liaisons Dangereuses._ The result of
 which comes out simply: “The Third Estate is the Nation.” On the
 other hand, Monseigneur d’Artois, with other Princes of the
 Blood, publishes, in solemn _Memorial_ to the King, that if such
 things be listened to, Privilege, Nobility, Monarchy, Church,
 State and Strongbox are in danger.[112] In danger truly: and yet
 if you do not listen, are they out of danger? It is the voice of
 all France, this sound that rises. Immeasurable, manifold; as the
 sound of outbreaking waters: wise were he who knew what to do in
 it,—if not to fly to the mountains, and hide himself? How an ideal, all-seeing Versailles Government, sitting there on
 such principles, in such an environment, would have determined to
 demean itself at this new juncture, may even yet be a question.
 Such a Government would have felt too well that its long task was
 now drawing to a close; that, under the guise of these
 States-General, at length inevitable, a new omnipotent Unknown of
 Democracy was coming into being; in presence of which no
 Versailles Government either could or should, except in a
 provisory character, continue extant. To enact which provisory
 character, so unspeakably important, might its whole faculties
 but have sufficed; and so a peaceable, gradual, well-conducted
 Abdication and _Domine-dimittas_ have been the issue! This for our ideal, all-seeing Versailles Government. But for the
 actual irrational Versailles Government? Alas, that is a
 Government existing there only for its own behoof: without right,
 except possession; and now also without might. It foresees
 nothing, sees nothing; has not so much as a purpose, but has only
 purposes,—and the instinct whereby all that exists will struggle
 to keep existing. Wholly a vortex; in which vain counsels,
 hallucinations, falsehoods, intrigues, and imbecilities whirl;
 like withered rubbish in the meeting of winds! The Œil-de-Bœuf
 has its irrational hopes, if also its fears. Since hitherto all
 States-General have done as good as nothing, why should these do
 more? The Commons, indeed, look dangerous; but on the whole is
 not revolt, unknown now for five generations, an impossibility?
 The Three Estates can, by management, be set against each other;
 the Third will, as heretofore, join with the King; will, out of
 mere spite and self-interest, be eager to tax and vex the other
 two. The other two are thus delivered bound into our hands, that
 we may fleece them likewise. Whereupon, money being got, and the
 Three Estates all in quarrel, dismiss them, and let the future go
 as it can! As good Archbishop Loménie was wont to say: ‘There are
 so many accidents; and it needs but one to save us.’—How many to
 destroy us? Poor Necker in the midst of such an anarchy does what is possible
 for him. He looks into it with obstinately hopeful face; lauds
 the known rectitude of the kingly mind; listens indulgent-like to
 the known perverseness of the queenly and courtly;—emits if any
 proclamation or regulation, one favouring the _Tiers Etat;_ but
 settling nothing; hovering afar off rather, and advising all
 things to settle themselves. The grand questions, for the
 present, have got reduced to two: the Double Representation, and
 the Vote by Head. Shall the Commons have a “double
 representation,” that is to say, have as many members as the
 Noblesse and Clergy united? Shall the States-General, when once
 assembled, vote and deliberate, in one body, or in three separate
 bodies; “vote by head, or vote by class,”—_ordre_ as they call
 it? These are the moot-points now filling all France with jargon,
 logic and eleutheromania. To terminate which, Necker bethinks
 him, Might not a second Convocation of the Notables be fittest?
 Such second Convocation is resolved on. On the 6th of November of this year 1788, these Notables
 accordingly have reassembled; after an interval of some eighteen
 months. They are Calonne’s old Notables, the same Hundred and
 Forty-four,—to show one’s impartiality; likewise to save time.
 They sit there once again, in their Seven Bureaus, in the hard
 winter weather: it is the hardest winter seen since 1709;
 thermometer below zero of Fahrenheit, Seine River frozen
 over.[113] Cold, scarcity and eleutheromaniac clamour: a changed
 world since these Notables were “organed out,” in May gone a
 year! They shall see now whether, under their Seven Princes of
 the Blood, in their Seven Bureaus, they can settle the
 moot-points. To the surprise of Patriotism, these Notables, once so patriotic,
 seem to incline the wrong way; towards the anti-patriotic side.
 They stagger at the Double Representation, at the Vote by Head:
 there is not affirmative decision; there is mere debating, and
 that not with the best aspects. For, indeed, were not these
 Notables themselves mostly of the Privileged Classes? They
 clamoured once; now they have their misgivings; make their
 dolorous representations. Let them vanish, ineffectual; and
 return no more! They vanish after a month’s session, on this 12th
 of December, year 1788: the _last_ terrestrial Notables, not to
 reappear any other time, in the History of the World. And so, the clamour still continuing, and the Pamphlets; and
 nothing but patriotic Addresses, louder and louder, pouting in on
 us from all corners of France,—Necker himself some fortnight
 after, before the year is yet done, has to present his
 _Report_,[114] recommending at his own risk that same Double
 Representation; nay almost enjoining it, so loud is the jargon
 and eleutheromania. What dubitating, what circumambulating! These
 whole six noisy months (for it began with Brienne in July,) has
 not _Report_ followed _Report_, and one Proclamation flown in the
 teeth of the other?[115] However, that first moot-point, as we see, is now settled. As for
 the second, that of voting by Head or by Order, it unfortunately
 is still left hanging. It hangs there, we may say, between the
 Privileged Orders and the Unprivileged; as a ready-made
 battle-prize, and necessity of war, from the very first: which
 battle-prize whosoever seizes it—may thenceforth bear as
 battle-flag, with the best omens! But so, at least, by Royal Edict of the 24th of January,[116]
 does it finally, to impatient expectant France, become not only
 indubitable that National Deputies _are_ to meet, but possible
 (so far and hardly farther has the royal Regulation gone) to
 begin electing them.
 Chapter 1.4.II.
 The Election. Up, then, and be doing! The royal signal-word flies through
 France, as through vast forests the rushing of a mighty wind. At
 Parish Churches, in Townhalls, and every House of Convocation; by
 Bailliages, by Seneschalsies, in whatsoever form men convene;
 there, with confusion enough, are Primary Assemblies forming. To
 elect your Electors; such is the form prescribed: then to draw up
 your “Writ of Plaints and Grievances (_Cahier de plaintes et
 doléances_),” of which latter there is no lack. With such virtue works this Royal January Edict; as it rolls
 rapidly, in its leathern mails, along these frostbound highways,
 towards all the four winds. Like some _fiat_, or magic
 spell-word;—which such things do resemble! For always, as it
 sounds out “at the market-cross,” accompanied with trumpet-blast;
 presided by Bailli, Seneschal, or other minor Functionary, with
 beef-eaters; or, in country churches is droned forth after
 sermon, “_au prône des messes paroissales;_” and is registered,
 posted and let fly over all the world,—you behold how this
 multitudinous French People, so long simmering and buzzing in
 eager expectancy, begins heaping and shaping itself into organic
 groups. Which organic groups, again, hold smaller organic
 grouplets: the inarticulate buzzing becomes articulate speaking
 and acting. By Primary Assembly, and then by Secondary; by
 “successive elections,” and infinite elaboration and scrutiny,
 according to prescribed process—shall the genuine “Plaints and
 Grievances” be at length got to paper; shall the fit National
 Representative be at length laid hold of.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' How the whole People shakes itself, as if it had one life; and,
 in thousand-voiced rumour, announces that it is awake, suddenly
 out of long death-sleep, and will thenceforth sleep no more! The
 long looked-for has come at last; wondrous news, of Victory,
 Deliverance, Enfranchisement, sounds magical through every heart.
 To the proud strong man it has come; whose strong hands shall no
 more be gyved; to whom boundless unconquered continents lie
 disclosed. The weary day-drudge has heard of it; the beggar with
 his crusts moistened in tears. What! To us also has hope reached;
 down even to us? Hunger and hardship are not to be eternal? The
 bread we extorted from the rugged glebe, and, with the toil of
 our sinews, reaped and ground, and kneaded into loaves, was not
 wholly for another, then; but we also shall eat of it, and be
 filled? Glorious news (answer the prudent elders), but all-too
 unlikely!—Thus, at any rate, may the lower people, who pay no
 money-taxes and have no right to vote,[117] assiduously crowd
 round those that do; and most Halls of Assembly, within doors and
 without, seem animated enough. Paris, alone of Towns, is to have Representatives; the number of
 them twenty. Paris is divided into Sixty Districts; each of which
 (assembled in some church, or the like) is choosing two Electors.
 Official deputations pass from District to District, for all is
 inexperience as yet, and there is endless consulting. The streets
 swarm strangely with busy crowds, pacific yet restless and
 loquacious; at intervals, is seen the gleam of military muskets;
 especially about the Palais, where Parlement, once more on duty,
 sits querulous, almost tremulous. Busy is the French world! In those great days, what poorest
 speculative craftsman but will leave his workshop; if not to
 vote, yet to assist in voting? On all highways is a rustling and
 bustling. Over the wide surface of France, ever and anon, through
 the spring months, as the Sower casts his corn abroad upon the
 furrows, sounds of congregating and dispersing; of crowds in
 deliberation, acclamation, voting by ballot and by voice,—rise
 discrepant towards the ear of Heaven. To which political
 phenomena add this economical one, that Trade is stagnant, and
 also Bread getting dear; for before the rigorous winter there
 was, as we said, a rigorous summer, with drought, and on the 13th
 of July with destructive hail. What a fearful day! all cried
 while that tempest fell. Alas, the next anniversary of it will be
 a worse.[118] Under such aspects is France electing National
 Representatives. The incidents and specialties of these Elections belong not to
 Universal, but to Local or Parish History: for which reason let
 not the new troubles of Grenoble or Besancon; the bloodshed on
 the streets of Rennes, and consequent march thither of the Breton
 “Young Men” with Manifesto by their “Mothers, Sisters and
 Sweethearts;”[119] nor suchlike, detain us here. It is the same
 sad history everywhere; with superficial variations. A reinstated
 Parlement (as at Besancon), which stands astonished at this
 Behemoth of a States-General it had itself evoked, starts
 forward, with more or less audacity, to fix a thorn in its nose;
 and, alas, is instantaneously struck down, and hurled quite
 out,—for the new popular force can use not only arguments but
 brickbats! Or else, and perhaps combined with this, it is an
 order of Noblesse (as in Brittany), which will beforehand tie up
 the Third Estate, that it harm not the old privileges. In which
 act of tying up, never so skilfully set about, there is likewise
 no possibility of prospering; but the Behemoth-Briareus snaps
 your cords like green rushes. Tie up? Alas, Messieurs! And then,
 as for your chivalry rapiers, valour and wager-of-battle, think
 one moment, how can that answer? The plebeian heart too has red
 life in it, which changes not to paleness at glance even of you;
 and “the six hundred Breton gentlemen assembled in arms, for
 seventy-two hours, in the Cordeliers’ Cloister, at Rennes,”—have
 to come out again, _wiser_ than they entered. For the Nantes
 Youth, the Angers Youth, all Brittany was astir; “mothers,
 sisters and sweethearts” shrieking after them, _March!_ The
 Breton Noblesse must even let the mad world have its way.[120] In other Provinces, the Noblesse, with equal goodwill, finds it
 better to stick to Protests, to well-redacted “_Cahiers_ of
 grievances,” and satirical writings and speeches. Such is
 partially their course in Provence; whither indeed Gabriel Honoré
 Riquetti Comte de Mirabeau has rushed down from Paris, to speak a
 word in season. In Provence, the Privileged, backed by their Aix
 Parlement, discover that such novelties, enjoined though they be
 by Royal Edict, tend to National detriment; and what is still
 more indisputable, “to impair the dignity of the Noblesse.”
 Whereupon Mirabeau protesting aloud, this same Noblesse, amid
 huge tumult within doors and without, flatly determines to expel
 him from their Assembly. No other method, not even that of
 successive duels, would answer with him, the obstreperous
 fierce-glaring man. Expelled he accordingly is. “In all countries, in all times,” exclaims he departing, “the
 Aristocrats have implacably pursued every friend of the People;
 and with tenfold implacability, if such a one were himself born
 of the Aristocracy. It was thus that the last of the Gracchi
 perished, by the hands of the Patricians. But he, being struck
 with the mortal stab, flung dust towards heaven, and called on
 the Avenging Deities; and from this dust there was born
 Marius,—Marius not so illustrious for exterminating the Cimbri,
 as for overturning in Rome the tyranny of the Nobles.”[121]
 Casting up _which_ new curious handful of dust (through the
 Printing-press), to breed what it can and may, Mirabeau stalks
 forth into the Third Estate. That he now, to ingratiate himself with this Third Estate,
 “opened a cloth-shop in Marseilles,” and for moments became a
 furnishing tailor, or even the fable that he did so, is to us
 always among the pleasant memorabilities of this era. Stranger
 Clothier never wielded the ell-wand, and rent webs for men, or
 fractional parts of men. The _Fils Adoptif_ is indignant at such
 disparaging fable,[122]—which nevertheless was widely believed in
 those days.[123] But indeed, if Achilles, in the heroic ages,
 killed mutton, why should not Mirabeau, in the unheroic ones,
 measure broadcloth? More authentic are his triumph-progresses through that disturbed
 district, with mob jubilee, flaming torches, “windows hired for
 two louis,” and voluntary guard of a hundred men. He is Deputy
 Elect, both of Aix and of Marseilles; but will prefer Aix. He has
 opened his far-sounding voice, the depths of his far-sounding
 soul; he can quell (such virtue is in a spoken word) the
 pride-tumults of the rich, the hunger-tumults of the poor; and
 wild multitudes move under him, as under the moon do billows of
 the sea: he has become a world compeller, and ruler over men. One other incident and specialty we note; with how different an
 interest! It is of the Parlement of Paris; which starts forward,
 like the others (only with less audacity, seeing better how it
 lay), to nose-ring that Behemoth of a States-General. Worthy
 Doctor Guillotin, respectable practitioner in Paris, has drawn up
 his little “Plan of a _Cahier of doléances_;”—as had he not,
 having the wish and gift, the clearest liberty to do? He is
 getting the people to sign it; whereupon the surly Parlement
 summons him to give an account of himself. He goes; but with all
 Paris at his heels; which floods the outer courts, and copiously
 signs the _Cahier_ even there, while the Doctor is giving account
 of himself within! The Parlement cannot too soon dismiss
 Guillotin, with compliments; to be borne home shoulder-high.[124]
 This respectable Guillotin we hope to behold once more, and
 perhaps only once; the Parlement not even once, but let it be
 engulphed unseen by us. Meanwhile such things, cheering as they are, tend little to cheer
 the national creditor, or indeed the creditor of any kind. In the
 midst of universal portentous doubt, what certainty can seem so
 certain as money in the purse, and the wisdom of keeping it
 there? Trading Speculation, Commerce of all kinds, has as far as
 possible come to a dead pause; and the hand of the industrious
 lies idle in his bosom. Frightful enough, when now the rigour of
 seasons has also done its part, and to scarcity of work is added
 scarcity of food! In the opening spring, there come rumours of
 forestalment, there come King’s Edicts, Petitions of bakers
 against millers; and at length, in the month of April—troops of
 ragged Lackalls, and fierce cries of starvation! These are the
 thrice-famed _Brigands:_ an actual existing quotity of persons:
 who, long reflected and reverberated through so many millions of
 heads, as in concave multiplying mirrors, become a whole Brigand
 World; and, like a kind of Supernatural Machinery wondrously move
 the Epos of the Revolution. The Brigands are here: the Brigands
 are there; the Brigands are coming! Not otherwise sounded the
 clang of Phoebus Apollo’s silver bow, scattering pestilence and
 pale terror; for this clang too was of the imagination;
 preternatural; and it too walked in formless immeasurability,
 _having made itself like to the Night_ (νυκτὶ ἐοικώς.)! But remark at least, for the first time, the singular empire of
 Suspicion, in those lands, in those days. If poor famishing men
 shall, prior to death, gather in groups and crowds, as the poor
 fieldfares and plovers do in bitter weather, were it but that
 they may chirp mournfully together, and misery look in the eyes
 of misery; if famishing men (what famishing fieldfares cannot do)
 should discover, once congregated, that they need not die while
 food is in the land, since they are many, and with empty wallets
 have right hands: in all this, what need were there of
 Preternatural Machinery? To most people none; but not to French
 people, in a time of Revolution. These Brigands (as Turgot’s also
 were, fourteen years ago) have all been set on; enlisted, though
 without tuck of drum,—by Aristocrats, by Democrats, by D’Orléans,
 D’Artois, and enemies of the public weal. Nay Historians, to this
 day, will prove it by one argument: these Brigands pretending to
 have no victual, nevertheless contrive to drink, nay, have been
 seen drunk.[125] An unexampled fact! But on the whole, may we not
 predict that a people, with such a width of Credulity and of
 Incredulity (the proper union of which makes Suspicion, and
 indeed unreason generally), will see Shapes enough of Immortals
 fighting in its battle-ranks, and never want for Epical
 Machinery? Be this as it may, the Brigands are clearly got to Paris, in
 considerable multitudes:[126] with sallow faces, lank hair (the
 true enthusiast complexion), with sooty rags; and also with large
 clubs, which they smite angrily against the pavement! These
 mingle in the Election tumult; would fain sign Guillotin’s
 _Cahier_, or any _Cahier_ or Petition whatsoever, could they but
 write. Their enthusiast complexion, the smiting of their sticks
 bodes little good to any one; least of all to rich
 master-manufacturers of the Suburb Saint-Antoine, with whose
 workmen they consort.
 Chapter 1.4.III.
 Grown Electric. But now also National Deputies from all ends of France are in
 Paris, with their commissions, what they call pouvoirs, or
 powers, in their pockets; inquiring, consulting; looking out for
 lodgings at Versailles. The States-General shall open there, if
 not on the First, then surely on the Fourth of May, in grand
 procession and gala. The _Salle des Menus_ is all
 new-carpentered, bedizened for them; their very costume has been
 fixed; a grand controversy which there was, as to “slouch-hats or
 slouched-hats,” for the Commons Deputies, has got as good as
 adjusted. Ever new strangers arrive; loungers, miscellaneous
 persons, officers on furlough,—as the worthy Captain Dampmartin,
 whom we hope to be acquainted with: these also, from all regions,
 have repaired hither, to see what is toward. Our Paris
 Committees, of the Sixty Districts, are busier than ever; it is
 now too clear, the Paris Elections will be late. On Monday, the 27th of April, Astronomer Bailly notices that the
 Sieur Réveillon is not at his post. The Sieur Réveillon,
 “extensive Paper Manufacturer of the Rue St. Antoine;” he,
 commonly so punctual, is absent from the Electoral Committee;—and
 even will never reappear there. In those “immense Magazines of
 velvet paper” has aught befallen? Alas, yes! Alas, it is no
 Montgolfier rising there today; but Drudgery, Rascality and the
 Suburb that is rising! Was the Sieur Réveillon, himself once a
 journeyman, heard to say that “a journeyman might live handsomely
 on fifteen _sous_ a-day?” Some sevenpence halfpenny: ’tis a
 slender sum! Or was he only thought, and believed, to be heard
 saying it? By this long chafing and friction it would appear the
 National temper has got _electric_. Down in those dark dens, in those dark heads and hungry hearts,
 who knows in what strange figure the new Political Evangel may
 have shaped itself; what miraculous “Communion of Drudges” may be
 getting formed! Enough: grim individuals, soon waxing to grim
 multitudes, and other multitudes crowding to see, beset that
 Paper-Warehouse; demonstrate, in loud ungrammatical language
 (addressed to the passions too), the insufficiency of sevenpence
 halfpenny a-day. The City-watch cannot dissipate them; broils
 arise and bellowings; Réveillon, at his wits’ end, entreats the
 Populace, entreats the authorities. Besenval, now in active
 command, Commandant of Paris, does, towards evening, to
 Réveillon’s earnest prayer, send some thirty Gardes Françaises.
 These clear the street, happily without firing; and take post
 there for the night in hope that it may be all over.[127] Not so: on the morrow it is far worse. Saint-Antoine has arisen
 anew, grimmer than ever;—reinforced by the unknown Tatterdemalion
 Figures, with their enthusiast complexion and large sticks. The
 City, through all streets, is flowing thitherward to see: “two
 cartloads of paving-stones, that happened to pass that way” have
 been seized as a visible godsend. Another detachment of Gardes
 Françaises must be sent; Besenval and the Colonel taking earnest
 counsel. Then still another; they hardly, with bayonets and
 menace of bullets, penetrate to the spot. What a sight! A street
 choked up, with lumber, tumult and the endless press of men. A
 Paper-Warehouse eviscerated by axe and fire: mad din of Revolt;
 musket-volleys responded to by yells, by miscellaneous missiles;
 by tiles raining from roof and window,—tiles, execrations and
 slain men! The Gardes Françaises like it not, but have to persevere. All day
 it continues, slackening and rallying; the sun is sinking, and
 Saint-Antoine has not yielded. The City flies hither and thither:
 alas, the sound of that musket-volleying booms into the far
 dining-rooms of the Chaussée d’Antin; alters the tone of the
 dinner-gossip there. Captain Dampmartin leaves his wine; goes out
 with a friend or two, to see the fighting. Unwashed men growl on
 him, with murmurs of ‘_À bas les Aristocrates_ (Down with the
 Aristocrats);’ and insult the cross of St. Louis? They elbow him,
 and hustle him; but do not pick his pocket;—as indeed at
 Réveillon’s too there was not the slightest stealing.[128] At fall of night, as the thing will not end, Besenval takes his
 resolution: orders out the _Gardes Suisses_ with two pieces of
 artillery. The Swiss Guards shall proceed thither; summon that
 rabble to depart, in the King’s name. If disobeyed, they shall
 load their artillery with grape-shot, visibly to the general eye;
 shall again summon; if again disobeyed, fire,—and keep firing
 “till the last man” be in this manner blasted off, and the street
 clear. With which spirited resolution, as might have been hoped,
 the business is got ended. At sight of the lit matches, of the
 foreign red-coated Switzers, Saint-Antoine dissipates; hastily,
 in the shades of dusk. There is an encumbered street; there are
 “from four to five hundred” dead men. Unfortunate Réveillon has
 found shelter in the Bastille; does therefrom, safe behind stone
 bulwarks, issue, plaint, protestation, explanation, for the next
 month. Bold Besenval has thanks from all the respectable Parisian
 classes; but finds no special notice taken of him at
 Versailles,—a thing the man of true worth is used to.[129] But how it originated, this fierce electric sputter and
 explosion? From D’Orléans! cries the Court-party: he, with his
 gold, enlisted these Brigands,—surely in some surprising manner,
 without sound of drum: he raked them in hither, from all corners;
 to ferment and take fire; evil is his good. From the Court! cries
 enlightened Patriotism: it is the cursed gold and wiles of
 Aristocrats that enlisted them; set them upon ruining an innocent
 Sieur Réveillon; to frighten the faint, and disgust men with the
 career of Freedom. Besenval, with reluctance, concludes that it came from “the
 English, our natural enemies.” Or, alas, might not one rather
 attribute it to Diana in the shape of Hunger? To some twin
 _Dioscuri_, OPPRESSION and REVENGE; so often seen in the battles
 of men? Poor Lackalls, all betoiled, besoiled, encrusted into dim
 defacement; into whom nevertheless the breath of the Almighty has
 breathed a living soul! To them it is clear only that
 eleutheromaniac Philosophism has yet baked no bread; that
 Patrioti Committee-men will level down to their own level, and no
 lower. Brigands, or whatever they might be, it was bitter earnest
 with them. They bury their dead with the title of _Défenseurs de
 la Patrie_, Martyrs of the good Cause. Or shall we say: Insurrection has now served its Apprenticeship;
 and this was its proof-stroke, and no inconclusive one? Its next
 will be a master-stroke; announcing indisputable Mastership to a
 whole astonished world. Let that rock-fortress, Tyranny’s
 stronghold, which they name _Bastille_, or _Building_, as if
 there were no other building,—look to its guns! But, in such wise, with primary and secondary Assemblies, and
 _Cahiers_ of Grievances; with motions, congregations of all
 kinds; with much thunder of froth-eloquence, and at last with
 thunder of platoon-musquetry,—does agitated France accomplish its
 Elections. With confused winnowing and sifting, in this rather
 tumultuous manner, it has now (all except some remnants of Paris)
 sifted out the true wheat-grains of National Deputies, Twelve
 Hundred and Fourteen in number; and will forthwith open its
 States-General.
 Chapter 1.4.IV.
 The Procession. On the first Saturday of May, it is gala at Versailles; and
 Monday, fourth of the month, is to be a still greater day. The
 Deputies have mostly got thither, and sought out lodgings; and
 are now successively, in long well-ushered files, kissing the
 hand of Majesty in the Château. Supreme Usher de Brézé does not
 give the highest satisfaction: we cannot but observe that in
 ushering Noblesse or Clergy into the anointed Presence, he
 liberally opens _both_ his folding-doors; and on the other hand,
 for members of the Third Estate opens only one! However, there is
 room to enter; Majesty has smiles for all. The good Louis welcomes his Honourable Members, with smiles of
 hope. He has prepared for them the Hall of _Menus_, the largest
 near him; and often surveyed the workmen as they went on. A
 spacious Hall: with raised platform for Throne, Court and
 Blood-royal; space for six hundred Commons Deputies in front; for
 half as many Clergy on this hand, and half as many Noblesse on
 that. It has lofty galleries; wherefrom dames of honour,
 splendent in _gaze d’or;_ foreign Diplomacies, and other
 gilt-edged white-frilled individuals to the number of two
 thousand,—may sit and look. Broad passages flow through it; and,
 outside the inner wall, all round it. There are committee-rooms,
 guard-rooms, robing-rooms: really a noble Hall; where upholstery,
 aided by the subject fine-arts, has done its best; and crimson
 tasseled cloths, and emblematic _fleurs-de-lys_ are not wanting. The Hall is ready: the very costume, as we said, has been
 settled; and the Commons are not to wear that hated slouch-hat
 (_chapeau clabaud_), but one not quite so slouched (_chapeau
 rabattu_). As for their manner of _working_, when all dressed:
 for their “voting by head or by order” and the rest,—this, which
 it were perhaps still time to settle, and in few hours will be no
 longer time, remains unsettled; hangs dubious in the breast of
 Twelve Hundred men. But now finally the Sun, on Monday the 4th of May, has
 risen;—unconcerned, as if it were no special day. And yet, as his
 first rays could strike music from the Memnon’s Statue on the
 Nile, what tones were these, so thrilling, tremulous of
 preparation and foreboding, which he awoke in every bosom at
 Versailles! Huge Paris, in all conceivable and inconceivable
 vehicles, is pouring itself forth; from each Town and Village
 come subsidiary rills; Versailles is a very sea of men. But above
 all, from the Church of St. Louis to the Church of Notre-Dame:
 one vast suspended-billow of Life,—with _spray_ scattered even to
 the chimney-pots! For on chimney-tops too, as over the roofs, and
 up thitherwards on every lamp-iron, sign-post, breakneck coign of
 vantage, sits patriotic Courage; and every window bursts with
 patriotic Beauty: for the Deputies are gathering at St. Louis
 Church; to march in procession to Notre-Dame, and hear sermon. Yes, friends, ye may sit and look: boldly or in thought, all
 France, and all Europe, may sit and look; for it is a day like
 few others. Oh, one might weep like Xerxes:—So many serried rows
 sit perched there; like winged creatures, alighted out of Heaven:
 all these, and so many more that follow them, shall have wholly
 fled aloft again, vanishing into the blue Deep; and the memory of
 this day still be fresh. It is the baptism-day of Democracy; sick
 Time has given it birth, the numbered months being run. The
 extreme-unction day of Feudalism! A superannuated System of
 Society, decrepit with toils (for has it not done much; produced
 you, and what ye have and know!)—and with thefts and brawls,
 named glorious-victories; and with profligacies, sensualities,
 and on the whole with dotage and senility,—is now to die: and so,
 with death-throes and birth-throes, a new one is to be born. What
 a work, O Earth and Heavens, what a work! Battles and bloodshed,
 September Massacres, Bridges of Lodi, retreats of Moscow,
 Waterloos, Peterloos, Tenpound Franchises, Tarbarrels and
 Guillotines;—and from this present date, if one might prophesy,
 some two centuries of it still to fight! Two centuries; hardly
 less; before Democracy go through its due, most baleful, stages
 of _Quack_ocracy; and a pestilential World be burnt up, and have
 begun to grow green and young again. Rejoice nevertheless, ye Versailles multitudes; to you, from whom
 all this is hid, and glorious end of it is visible. This day,
 sentence of death is pronounced on Shams; judgment of
 resuscitation, were it but far off, is pronounced on Realities.
 This day it is declared aloud, as with a Doom-trumpet, that a
 _Lie is unbelievable_. Believe that, stand by that, if more there
 be not; and let what thing or things soever will follow it
 follow. “Ye can no other; God be your help!” So spake a greater
 than any of you; opening _his_ Chapter of World-History. Behold, however! The doors of St. Louis Church flung wide; and
 the Procession of Processions advancing towards Notre-Dame!
 Shouts rend the air; one shout, at which Grecian birds might drop
 dead. It is indeed a stately, solemn sight. The Elected of
 France, and then the Court of France; they are marshalled and
 march there, all in prescribed place and costume. Our Commons “in
 plain black mantle and white cravat;” Noblesse, in gold-worked,
 bright-dyed cloaks of velvet, resplendent, rustling with laces,
 waving with plumes; the Clergy in rochet, alb, or other best
 _pontificalibus:_ lastly comes the King himself, and King’s
 Household, also in their brightest blaze of pomp,—their brightest
 and final one. Some Fourteen Hundred Men blown together from all
 winds, on the deepest errand. Yes, in that silent marching mass there lies Futurity enough. No
 symbolic Ark, like the old Hebrews, do these men bear: yet with
 them too is a Covenant; they too preside at a new Era in the
 History of Men. The whole Future is there, and Destiny
 dim-brooding over it; in the hearts and unshaped thoughts of
 these men, it lies illegible, inevitable. Singular to think:
 _they_ have it in them; yet not they, not mortal, only the Eye
 above can read it,—as it shall unfold itself, in fire and
 thunder, of siege, and field-artillery; in the rustling of
 battle-banners, the tramp of hosts, in the glow of burning
 cities, the shriek of strangled nations! Such things lie hidden,
 safe-wrapt in this Fourth day of May;—say rather, had lain in
 some other unknown day, of which this latter is the public fruit
 and outcome. As indeed what wonders lie in every Day,—had we the
 sight, as happily we have not, to decipher it: for is not every
 meanest Day “the conflux of two Eternities!” Meanwhile, suppose we too, good Reader, should, as now without
 miracle Muse Clio enables us—take _our_ station also on some
 coign of vantage; and glance momentarily over this Procession,
 and this Life-sea; with far other eyes than the rest do, namely
 with prophetic? We can mount, and stand there, without fear of
 falling. As for the Life-sea, or onlooking unnumbered Multitude, it is
 unfortunately all-too dim. Yet as we gaze fixedly, do not
 nameless Figures not a few, which shall not always be nameless,
 disclose themselves; visible or presumable there! Young Baroness
 de Staël—she evidently looks from a window; among older
 honourable women.[130] Her father is Minister, and one of the
 gala personages; to his own eyes the chief one. Young spiritual
 Amazon, thy rest is not there; nor thy loved Father’s: “as
 Malebranche saw all things in God, so M. Necker sees all things
 in Necker,”—a theorem that will not hold. But where is the brown-locked, light-behaved, fire-hearted
 Demoiselle Théroigne? Brown eloquent Beauty; who, with thy winged
 words and glances, shalt thrill rough bosoms, whole steel
 battalions, and persuade an Austrian Kaiser,—pike and helm lie
 provided for thee in due season; and, alas, also strait-waistcoat
 and long lodging in the Salpêtrière! Better hadst thou staid in
 native Luxemburg, and been the mother of some brave man’s
 children: but it was not thy task, it was not thy lot. Of the rougher sex how, without tongue, or hundred tongues, of
 iron, enumerate the notabilities! Has not Marquis Valadi hastily
 quitted his quaker broadbrim; his Pythagorean Greek in Wapping,
 and the city of Glasgow?[131] De Morande from his _Courrier de
 l’Europe;_ Linguet from his _Annales_, they looked eager through
 the London fog, and became Ex-Editors,—that they might feed the
 guillotine, and have their due. Does Louvet (of _Faublas_) stand
 a-tiptoe? And Brissot, hight De Warville, friend of the Blacks?
 He, with Marquis Condorcet, and Clavière the Genevese “have
 created the _Moniteur_ Newspaper,” or are about creating it. Able
 Editors must give account of such a day. Or seest thou with any distinctness, low down probably, not in
 places of honour, a Stanislas Maillard, riding-tipstaff
 (_huissier à cheval_) of the Châtelet; one of the shiftiest of
 men? A Captain Hulin of Geneva, Captain Elie of the Queen’s
 Regiment; both with an air of half-pay? Jourdan, with
 tile-coloured whiskers, not yet with tile-beard; an unjust dealer
 in mules? He shall be, in a few months, Jourdan the Headsman, and
 have other work. Surely also, in some place not of honour, stands or sprawls up
 querulous, that he too, though short, may see,—one squalidest
 bleared mortal, redolent of soot and horse-drugs: Jean Paul Marat
 of Neuchâtel! O Marat, Renovator of Human Science, Lecturer on
 Optics; O thou remarkablest Horseleech, once in D’Artois’
 Stables,—as thy bleared soul looks forth, through thy bleared,
 dull-acrid, wo-stricken face, what sees it in all this? Any
 faintest light of hope; like dayspring after Nova-Zembla night?
 Or is it but _blue_ sulphur-light, and spectres; woe, suspicion,
 revenge without end? Of Draper Lecointre, how he shut his cloth-shop hard by, and
 stepped forth, one need hardly speak. Nor of Santerre, the
 sonorous Brewer from the Faubourg St. Antoine. Two other Figures,
 and only two, we signalise there. The huge, brawny, Figure;
 through whose black brows, and rude flattened face (_figure
 ecrasée_), there looks a waste energy as of Hercules not yet
 furibund,—he is an esurient, unprovided Advocate; Danton by name:
 him mark. Then that other, his slight-built comrade and
 craft-brother; he with the long curling locks; with the face of
 dingy blackguardism, wondrously irradiated with genius, as if a
 naphtha-lamp burnt within it: that Figure is Camille Desmoulins.
 A fellow of infinite shrewdness, wit, nay humour; one of the
 sprightliest clearest souls in all these millions. Thou poor
 Camille, say of thee what they may, it were but falsehood to
 pretend one did not almost love thee, thou headlong
 lightly-sparkling man! But the brawny, not yet furibund Figure,
 we say, is Jacques Danton; a name that shall be “tolerably known
 in the Revolution.” He is President of the electoral Cordeliers
 District at Paris, or about to be it; and shall open his lungs of
 brass. We dwell no longer on the mixed shouting Multitude: for now,
 behold, the Commons Deputies are at hand! Which of these Six Hundred individuals, in plain white cravat,
 that have come up to regenerate France, might one guess would
 become their _king?_ For a king or leader they, as all bodies of
 men, must have: be their work what it may, there is one man there
 who, by character, faculty, position, is fittest of all to do it;
 that man, as future not yet elected king, walks there among the
 rest. He with the thick black locks, will it be? With the _hure_,
 as himself calls it, or black _boar’s-head_, fit to be “shaken”
 as a senatorial portent? Through whose shaggy beetle-brows, and
 rough-hewn, seamed, carbuncled face, there look natural ugliness,
 small-pox, incontinence, bankruptcy,—and burning fire of genius;
 like comet-fire glaring fuliginous through murkiest confusions?
 It is _Gabriel Honoré Riquetti de Mirabeau_, the world-compeller;
 man-ruling Deputy of Aix! According to the Baroness de Staël, he
 steps proudly along, though looked at askance here, and shakes
 his black _chevelure_, or lion’s-mane; as if prophetic of great
 deeds.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Yes, Reader, that is the Type-Frenchman of this epoch; as
 Voltaire was of the last. He is French in his aspirations,
 acquisitions, in his virtues, in his vices; perhaps more French
 than any other man;—and intrinsically such a mass of manhood too.
 Mark him well. The National Assembly were all different without
 that one; nay, he might say with the old Despot: ‘The National
 Assembly? I am that.’ Of a southern climate, of wild southern blood: for the Riquettis,
 or Arighettis, had to fly from Florence and the Guelfs, long
 centuries ago, and settled in Provence; where from generation to
 generation they have ever approved themselves a peculiar kindred:
 irascible, indomitable, sharp-cutting, true, like the steel they
 wore; of an intensity and activity that sometimes verged towards
 madness, yet did not reach it. One ancient Riquetti, in mad
 fulfilment of a mad vow, chains two Mountains together; and the
 chain, with its “iron star of five rays,” is still to be seen.
 May not a modern Riquetti unchain so much, and set it
 drifting,—which also shall be seen? Destiny has work for that swart burly-headed Mirabeau; Destiny
 has watched over him, prepared him from afar. Did not his
 Grandfather, stout _Col-d’Argent_ (Silver-Stock, so they named
 him), shattered and slashed by seven-and-twenty wounds in one
 fell day lie sunk together on the Bridge at Casano; while Prince
 Eugene’s cavalry galloped and regalloped over him,—only the
 flying sergeant had thrown a camp-kettle over that loved head;
 and Vendôme, dropping his spyglass, moaned out, “Mirabeau is
 _dead_, then!” Nevertheless he was not dead: he awoke to breathe,
 and miraculous surgery;—for Gabriel was yet to be. With his
 silver _stock_ he kept his scarred head erect, through long
 years; and wedded; and produced tough Marquis Victor, the _Friend
 of Men_. Whereby at last in the appointed year 1749, this
 long-expected rough-hewn Gabriel Honoré did likewise see the
 light: roughest lion’s-whelp ever littered of that rough breed.
 How the old lion (for our old Marquis too was lion-like, most
 unconquerable, kingly-genial, most perverse) gazed wonderingly on
 his offspring; and determined to train him as no lion had yet
 been! It is in vain, O Marquis! This cub, though thou slay him
 and flay him, will not learn to draw in dogcart of Political
 Economy, and be a _Friend of Men;_ he will not be Thou, must and
 will be Himself, another than Thou. Divorce lawsuits, “whole
 family save one in prison, and three-score _Lettres-de-Cachet_”
 for thy own sole use, do but astonish the world. Our Luckless Gabriel, sinned against and sinning, has been in the
 Isle of Rhe, and heard the Atlantic from his tower; in the Castle
 of If, and heard the Mediterranean at Marseilles. He has been in
 the Fortress of Joux; and forty-two months, with hardly clothing
 to his back, in the Dungeon of Vincennes;—all by
 _Lettre-de-Cachet_, from his lion father. He has been in
 Pontarlier Jails (self-constituted prisoner); was noticed fording
 estuaries of the sea (at low water), in flight from the face of
 men. He has pleaded before Aix Parlements (to get back his wife);
 the public gathering on roofs, to see since they could not hear:
 ‘the clatter-teeth (_claque-dents_)!’ snarles singular old
 Mirabeau; discerning in such admired forensic eloquence nothing
 but two clattering jaw-bones, and a head vacant, sonorous, of the
 drum species. But as for Gabriel Honoré, in these strange wayfarings, what has
 he not seen and tried! From drill-sergeants, to prime-ministers,
 to foreign and domestic booksellers, all manner of men he has
 seen. All manner of men he has gained; for at bottom it is a
 social, loving heart, that wild unconquerable one:—more
 especially all manner of women. From the Archer’s Daughter at
 Saintes to that fair young Sophie Madame Monnier, whom he could
 not but “steal,” and be beheaded for—in effigy! For indeed hardly
 since the Arabian Prophet lay dead to Ali’s admiration, was there
 seen such a Love-hero, with the strength of thirty men. In War,
 again, he has helped to conquer Corsica; fought duels, irregular
 brawls; horsewhipped calumnious barons. In Literature, he has
 written on _Despotism_, on _Lettres-de-Cachet;_ Erotics
 Sapphic-Werterean, Obscenities, Profanities; Books on the
 _Prussian Monarchy_, on _Cagliostro_, on _Calonne_, on _the Water
 Companies of Paris:_—each book comparable, we will say, to a
 bituminous alarum-fire; huge, smoky, sudden! The firepan, the
 kindling, the bitumen were his own; but the lumber, of rags, old
 wood and nameless combustible rubbish (for all is fuel to him),
 was gathered from huckster, and ass-panniers, of every
 description under heaven. Whereby, indeed, hucksters enough have
 been heard to exclaim: Out upon it, the fire is _mine!_ Nay, consider it more generally, seldom had man such a talent for
 borrowing. The idea, the faculty of another man he can make his;
 the man himself he can make his. ‘All reflex and echo (_tout de
 reflet et de réverbère_)!’ snarls old Mirabeau, who can see, but
 will not. Crabbed old Friend of Men! it is his sociality, his
 aggregative nature; and will now be the quality of all for him.
 In that forty-years “struggle against despotism,” he has gained
 the glorious faculty of _self-help_, and yet not lost the
 glorious natural gift of _fellowship_, of being helped. Rare
 union! This man can live self-sufficing—yet lives also in the
 life of other men; can make men love him, work with him: a born
 king of men! But consider further how, as the old Marquis still snarls, he has
 ‘made away with (_humé_, swallowed) all _Formulas;_’—a fact
 which, if we meditate it, will in these days mean much. This is
 no man of system, then; he is only a man of instincts and
 insights. A man nevertheless who will glare fiercely on any
 object; and see through it, and conquer it: for he has intellect,
 he has will, force beyond other men. A man not with
 _logic-spectacles;_ but with an _eye!_ Unhappily without
 Decalogue, moral Code or Theorem of any fixed sort; yet not
 without a strong living Soul in him, and Sincerity there: a
 Reality, not an Artificiality, not a Sham! And so he, having
 struggled “forty years against despotism,” and “made away with
 all formulas,” shall now become the spokesman of a Nation bent to
 do the same. For is it not precisely the struggle of France also
 to cast off despotism; to make away with _her_ old
 formulas,—having found them naught, worn out, far from the
 reality? She will make away with _such_ formulas;—and even go
 _bare_, if need be, till she have found new ones. Towards such work, in such manner, marches he, this singular
 Riquetti Mirabeau. In fiery rough figure, with black Samson-locks
 under the slouch-hat, he steps along there. A fiery fuliginous
 mass, which could not be choked and smothered, but would fill all
 France with smoke. And now it has got _air;_ it will burn its
 whole substance, its whole smoke-atmosphere too, and fill all
 France with flame. Strange lot! Forty years of that smouldering,
 with foul fire-damp and vapour enough, then victory over
 that;—and like a burning mountain he blazes heaven-high; and, for
 twenty-three resplendent months, pours out, in flame and molten
 fire-torrents, all that is in him, the Pharos and Wonder-sign of
 an amazed Europe;—and then lies hollow, cold forever! Pass on,
 thou questionable Gabriel Honoré, the greatest of them all: in
 the whole National Deputies, in the whole Nation, there is none
 like and none second to thee. But now if Mirabeau is the greatest, who of these Six Hundred may
 be the meanest? Shall we say, that anxious, slight,
 ineffectual-looking man, under thirty, in spectacles; his eyes
 (were the glasses off) troubled, careful; with upturned face,
 snuffing dimly the uncertain future-time; complexion of a
 multiplex atrabiliar colour, the final shade of which may be the
 pale sea-green.[132] That greenish-coloured (_verdâtre_)
 individual is an Advocate of Arras; his name is _Maximilien
 Robespierre_. The son of an Advocate; his father founded
 mason-lodges under Charles Edward, the English Prince or
 Pretender. Maximilien the first-born was thriftily educated; he
 had brisk Camille Desmoulins for schoolmate in the College of
 Louis le Grand, at Paris. But he begged our famed
 Necklace-Cardinal, Rohan, the patron, to let him depart thence,
 and resign in favour of a younger brother. The strict-minded Max
 departed; home to paternal Arras; and even had a Law-case there
 and pleaded, not unsuccessfully, “in favour of the first Franklin
 thunder-rod.” With a strict painful mind, an understanding small
 but clear and ready, he grew in favour with official persons, who
 could foresee in him an excellent man of business, happily quite
 free from genius. The Bishop, therefore, taking counsel, appoints
 him Judge of his diocese; and he faithfully does justice to the
 people: till behold, one day, a culprit comes whose crime merits
 hanging; and the strict-minded Max must abdicate, for his
 conscience will not permit the dooming of any son of Adam to die.
 A strict-minded, strait-laced man! A man unfit for Revolutions?
 Whose small soul, transparent wholesome-looking as small ale,
 could by no chance ferment into virulent _alegar_,—the mother of
 ever new alegar; till all France were grown acetous virulent? We
 shall see. Between which two extremes of grandest and meanest, so many grand
 and mean roll on, towards their several destinies, in that
 Procession! There is _Cazalès_, the learned young soldier; who
 shall become the eloquent orator of Royalism, and earn the shadow
 of a name. Experienced _Mounier_, experienced _Malouet;_ whose
 Presidential Parlementary experience the stream of things shall
 soon leave stranded. A Pétion has left his gown and briefs at
 Chartres for a stormier sort of pleading; has not forgotten his
 violin, being fond of music. His hair is grizzled, though he is
 still young: convictions, beliefs, placid-unalterable are in that
 man; not hindmost of them, belief in himself. A
 Protestant-clerical _Rabaut-St.-Etienne_, a slender young
 eloquent and vehement _Barnave_, will help to regenerate France.
 There are so many of them young. Till thirty the Spartans did not
 suffer a man to marry: but how many men here under thirty; coming
 to produce not one sufficient citizen, but a nation and a world
 of such! The old to heal up rents; the young to remove
 rubbish:—which latter, is it not, indeed, the task here? Dim, formless from this distance, yet authentically there, thou
 noticest the Deputies from Nantes? To us mere clothes-screens,
 with slouch-hat and cloak, but bearing in their pocket a _Cahier_
 of _doléances_ with this singular clause, and more such in it:
 “That the master wigmakers of Nantes be not troubled with new
 gild-brethren, the actually existing number of ninety-two being
 more than sufficient!”[133] The Rennes people have elected Farmer
 _Gérard_, “a man of natural sense and rectitude, without any
 learning.” He walks there, with solid step; unique, “in his
 rustic farmer-clothes;” which he will wear always; careless of
 short-cloaks and costumes. The name Gérard, or “_Père Gérard_,
 Father Gérard,” as they please to call him, will fly far; borne
 about in endless banter; in Royalist satires, in Republican
 didactic Almanacks.[134] As for the man Gerard, being asked once,
 what he did, after trial of it, candidly think of this
 Parlementary work,—‘I think,’ answered he, ‘that there are a good
 many scoundrels among us.’ so walks Father Gérard; solid in his
 thick shoes, whithersoever bound. And worthy _Doctor Guillotin_, whom we hoped to behold one other
 time? If not here, the Doctor should be here, and we see him with
 the eye of prophecy: for indeed the Parisian Deputies are all a
 little late. Singular Guillotin, respectable practitioner: doomed
 by a satiric destiny to the strangest immortal glory that ever
 kept obscure mortal from his resting-place, the bosom of
 oblivion! Guillotin can improve the ventilation of the Hall; in
 all cases of medical police and _hygiène_ be a present aid: but,
 greater far, he can produce his “Report on the Penal Code;” and
 reveal therein a cunningly devised Beheading Machine, which shall
 become famous and world-famous. This is the product of
 Guillotin’s endeavours, gained not without meditation and
 reading; which product popular gratitude or levity christens by a
 feminine derivative name, as if it were his daughter: _La
 Guillotine!_ ‘With my machine, Messieurs, I whisk off your head
 (_vous fais sauter la tête_) in a twinkling, and you have no
 pain;’—whereat they all laugh.[135] Unfortunate Doctor! For
 two-and-twenty years he, unguillotined, shall hear nothing but
 guillotine, see nothing but guillotine; then dying, shall through
 long centuries wander, as it were, a disconsolate ghost, on the
 wrong side of Styx and Lethe; his name like to outlive Cæsar’s. See _Bailly_, likewise of Paris, time-honoured Historian of
 Astronomy Ancient and Modern. Poor Bailly, how thy serenely
 beautiful Philosophising, with its soft moonshiny clearness and
 thinness, ends in foul thick confusion—of Presidency, Mayorship,
 diplomatic Officiality, rabid Triviality, and the throat of
 everlasting Darkness! Far was it to descend from the heavenly
 Galaxy to the _Drapeau Rouge:_ beside that fatal dung-heap, on
 that last hell-day, thou must “tremble,” though only with cold,
 “_de froid_.” Speculation is not practice: to be weak is not so
 miserable; but to be weaker than our task. Wo the day when they
 mounted thee, a peaceable pedestrian, on that wild Hippogriff of
 a Democracy; which, spurning the firm earth, nay lashing at the
 very _stars_, no yet known Astolpho could have ridden! In the Commons Deputies there are Merchants, Artists, Men of
 Letters; three hundred and seventy-four Lawyers;[136] and at
 least one Clergyman: the _Abbé Sieyes_. Him also Paris sends,
 among its twenty. Behold him, the light thin man; cold, but
 elastic, wiry; instinct with the pride of Logic; passionless, or
 with but one passion, that of self-conceit. If indeed that can be
 called a passion, which, in its independent concentrated
 greatness, seems to have soared into transcendentalism; and to
 sit there with a kind of godlike indifference, and look down on
 passion! He is the man, and wisdom shall die with him. This is
 the Sieyes who shall be System-builder, Constitution-builder
 General; and build Constitutions (as many as wanted)
 skyhigh,—which shall all unfortunately fall before he get the
 scaffolding away. ‘_La Politique_,’ said he to Dumont, ‘Polity is
 a science I think I have completed (_achevée_).’[137] What
 things, O Sieyes, with thy clear assiduous eyes, art thou to see!
 But were it not curious to know how Sieyes, now in these days
 (for he is said to be still alive)[138] looks out on all that
 Constitution masonry, through the rheumy soberness of extreme
 age? Might we hope, still with the old irrefragable
 transcendentalism? The victorious cause pleased the gods, the
 vanquished one pleased Sieyes (_victa Catoni_). Thus, however, amid skyrending vivats, and blessings from every
 heart, has the Procession of the Commons Deputies rolled by. Next follow the Noblesse, and next the Clergy; concerning both of
 whom it might be asked, What they specially have come for?
 Specially, little as they dream of it, to answer this question,
 put in a voice of thunder: What are you doing in God’s fair Earth
 and Task-garden; where whosoever is not working is begging or
 stealing? Wo, wo to themselves and to all, if they can only
 answer: Collecting tithes, Preserving game!—Remark, meanwhile,
 how _D’Orléans_ affects to step before his own Order, and mingle
 with the Commons. For him are _vivats:_ few for the rest, though
 all wave in plumed “hats of a feudal cut,” and have sword on
 thigh; though among them is _D’Antraigues_, the young
 Languedocian gentleman,—and indeed many a Peer more or less
 noteworthy. There are _Liancourt_, and _La Rochefoucault;_ the liberal
 Anglomaniac Dukes. There is a filially pious _Lally;_ a couple of
 liberal _Lameths_. Above all, there is a _Lafayette;_ whose name
 shall be Cromwell-Grandison, and fill the world. Many a “formula”
 has this Lafayette too made away with; yet not _all_ formulas. He
 sticks by the Washington-formula; and by that he will stick;—and
 hang by it, as by sure bower-anchor hangs and swings the tight
 war-ship, which, after all changes of wildest weather and water,
 is found still hanging. Happy for him; be it glorious or not!
 Alone of all Frenchmen he has a theory of the world, and right
 mind to conform thereto; he can become a hero and perfect
 character, were it but the hero of one idea. Note further our old
 Parlementary friend, _Crispin-Catiline d’Espréménil_. He is
 returned from the Mediterranean Islands, a redhot royalist,
 repentant to the finger-ends;—unsettled-looking; whose light,
 dusky-glowing at best, now flickers foul in the socket; whom the
 National Assembly will by and by, to save time, “regard as in a
 state of distraction.” Note lastly that globular _Younger_
 Mirabeau; indignant that his elder Brother is among the Commons:
 it is _Viscomte_ Mirabeau; named oftener Mirabeau _Tonneau_
 (Barrel Mirabeau), on account of his rotundity, and the
 quantities of strong liquor he contains. There then walks our French Noblesse. All in the old pomp of
 chivalry: and yet, alas, how changed from the old position;
 drifted far down from their native latitude, like Arctic icebergs
 got into the Equatorial sea, and fast thawing there! Once these
 Chivalry _Duces_ (Dukes, as they are still named) did actually
 _lead_ the world,—were it only towards battle-spoil, where lay
 the world’s best wages then: moreover, being the ablest Leaders
 going, they had their lion’s share, those _Duces;_ which none
 could grudge them. But now, when so many Looms, improved
 Ploughshares, Steam-Engines and Bills of Exchange have been
 invented; and, for battle-brawling itself, men hire
 Drill-Sergeants at eighteen-pence a-day,—what mean these
 goldmantled Chivalry Figures, walking there “in black-velvet
 cloaks,” in high-plumed “hats of a feudal cut”? Reeds shaken in
 the wind! The Clergy have got up; with _Cahiers_ for abolishing
 pluralities, enforcing residence of bishops, better payment of
 tithes.[139] The Dignitaries, we can observe, walk stately, apart
 from the numerous Undignified,—who indeed are properly little
 other than Commons disguised in Curate-frocks. Here, however,
 though by strange ways, shall the Precept be fulfilled, and they
 that are greatest (much to their astonishment) become least. For
 one example, out of many, mark that plausible _Grégoire:_ one day
 Curé Grégoire shall be a Bishop, when the now stately are
 wandering distracted, as Bishops _in partibus_. With other
 thought, mark also the _Abbé Maury:_ his broad bold face; mouth
 accurately primmed; full eyes, that ray out intelligence,
 falsehood,—the sort of sophistry which is astonished you should
 find it sophistical. Skilfulest vamper-up of old rotten leather,
 to make it look like new; always a rising man; he used to tell
 Mercier, ‘You will see; I shall be in the Academy before
 you.’[140] Likely indeed, thou skilfullest Maury; nay thou shalt
 have a Cardinal’s Hat, and plush and glory; but alas, also, in
 the longrun—mere oblivion, like the rest of us; and six feet of
 earth! What boots it, vamping rotten leather on these terms?
 Glorious in comparison is the livelihood thy good old Father
 earns, by making shoes,—one may hope, in a sufficient manner.
 Maury does not want for audacity. He shall wear pistols, by and
 by; and at death-cries of ‘_La Lanterne_, The Lamp-iron;’ answer
 coolly, ‘Friends, will you see better there?’ But yonder, halting lamely along, thou noticest next _Bishop
 Talleyrand-Perigord_, his Reverence of Autun. A sardonic grimness
 lies in that irreverent Reverence of Autun. He will do and suffer
 strange things; and will _become_ surely one of the strangest
 things ever seen, or like to be seen. A man living in falsehood,
 and on falsehood; yet not what you can call a false man: there is
 the specialty! It will be an enigma for future ages, one may
 hope: hitherto such a product of Nature and Art was possible only
 for this age of ours,—Age of Paper, and of the Burning of Paper.
 Consider Bishop Talleyrand and Marquis Lafayette as the topmost
 of their two kinds; and say once more, looking at what they did
 and what they were, _O Tempus ferax rerum!_ On the whole, however, has not this unfortunate Clergy also
 drifted in the Time-stream, far from its native latitude? An
 anomalous mass of men; of whom the whole world has already a dim
 understanding that it can understand nothing. They were once a
 Priesthood, interpreters of Wisdom, revealers of the Holy that is
 in Man: a true _Clerus_ (or Inheritance of God on Earth): but
 now?—They pass silently, with such _Cahiers_ as they have been
 able to redact; and none cries, God bless them. King Louis with his Court brings up the rear: he cheerful, in
 this day of hope, is saluted with plaudits; still more Necker his
 Minister. Not so the Queen; on whom hope shines not steadily any
 more. Ill-fated Queen! Her hair is already gray with many cares
 and crosses; her first-born son is dying in these weeks: black
 falsehood has ineffaceably soiled her name; ineffaceably while
 this generation lasts. Instead of _Vive la Reine_, voices insult
 her with _Vive d’Orléans_. Of her queenly beauty little remains
 except its stateliness; not now gracious, but haughty, rigid,
 silently enduring. With a most mixed feeling, wherein joy has no
 part, she resigns herself to a day she hoped never to have seen.
 Poor Marie Antoinette; with thy quick noble instincts; vehement
 glancings, vision all-too fitful narrow for the work thou hast to
 do! O there are tears in store for thee; bitterest wailings, soft
 womanly meltings, though thou hast the heart of an imperial
 Theresa’s Daughter. Thou doomed one, shut thy eyes on the
 future!— And so, in stately Procession, have passed the Elected of France.
 Some towards honour and quick fire-consummation; most towards
 dishonour; not a few towards massacre, confusion, emigration,
 desperation: all towards Eternity!—So many heterogeneities cast
 together into the fermenting-vat; there, with incalculable
 action, counteraction, elective affinities, explosive
 developments, to work out healing for a sick moribund System of
 Society! Probably the strangest Body of Men, if we consider well,
 that ever met together on our Planet on such an errand. So
 thousandfold complex a Society, ready to burst-up from its
 infinite depths; and these men, its rulers and healers, without
 life-rule for themselves,—other life-rule than a Gospel according
 to Jean Jacques! To the wisest of them, what we must call the
 wisest, man is properly an Accident under the sky. Man is without
 Duty round him; except it be “to make the Constitution.” He is
 without Heaven above him, or Hell beneath him; he has no God in
 the world. What further or better belief can be said to exist in these
 Twelve Hundred? Belief in high-plumed hats of a feudal cut; in
 heraldic scutcheons; in the divine right of Kings, in the divine
 right of Game-destroyers. Belief, or what is still worse, canting
 half-belief; or worst of all, mere Macchiavellic
 pretence-of-belief,—in consecrated dough-wafers, and the godhood
 of a poor old Italian Man! Nevertheless in that immeasurable
 Confusion and Corruption, which struggles there so blindly to
 become less confused and corrupt, there is, as we said, this one
 salient point of a New Life discernible: the deep fixed
 Determination to have done with Shams. A determination, which,
 consciously or unconsciously, is _fixed;_ which waxes ever more
 fixed, into very madness and fixed-idea; which in such embodiment
 as lies provided there, shall now unfold itself rapidly:
 monstrous, stupendous, unspeakable; new for long thousands of
 years!—How has the Heaven’s _light_, oftentimes in this Earth, to
 clothe itself in thunder and electric murkiness; and descend as
 molten _lightning_, blasting, if purifying! Nay is it not rather
 the very murkiness, and atmospheric suffocation, that _brings_
 the lightning and the light? The new Evangel, as the old had
 been, was it to be born in the Destruction of a World? But how the Deputies assisted at High Mass, and heard sermon, and
 applauded the preacher, church as it was, when he preached
 politics; how, next day, with sustained pomp, they are, for the
 first time, installed in their _Salles des Menus_ (Hall no longer
 of _Amusements_), and become a States-General,—readers can fancy
 for themselves. The King from his _estrade_, gorgeous as Solomon
 in all his glory, runs his eye over that majestic Hall;
 many-plumed, many-glancing; bright-tinted as rainbow, in the
 galleries and near side spaces, where Beauty sits raining bright
 influence. Satisfaction, as of one that after long voyaging had
 got to port, plays over his broad simple face: the innocent King!
 He rises and speaks, with sonorous tone, a conceivable speech.
 With which, still more with the succeeding one-hour and two-hour
 speeches of Garde-des-Sceaux and M. Necker, full of nothing but
 patriotism, hope, faith, and deficiency of the revenue,—no reader
 of these pages shall be tried. We remark only that, as his Majesty, on finishing the speech, put
 on his plumed hat, and the Noblesse according to custom imitated
 him, our Tiers-Etat Deputies did mostly, not without a shade of
 fierceness, in like manner clap-on, and even crush on their
 slouched hats; and stand there awaiting the issue.[141] Thick
 buzz among them, between majority and minority of _Couvrezvous,
 Décrouvrez-vous_ (Hats off, Hats on)! To which his Majesty puts
 end, by taking _off_ his own royal hat again. The session terminates without further accident or omen than
 this; with which, significantly enough, France has opened her
 States-General.
 BOOK 1.V.
 THE THIRD ESTATE
 Chapter 1.5.I.
 Inertia. That exasperated France, in this same National Assembly of hers,
 has got something, nay something great, momentous, indispensable,
 cannot be doubted; yet still the question were: Specially _what?_
 A question hard to solve, even for calm onlookers at this
 distance; wholly insoluble to actors in the middle of it. The
 States-General, created and conflated by the passionate effort of
 the whole nation, is there as a thing high and lifted up. Hope,
 jubilating, cries aloud that it will prove a miraculous Brazen
 Serpent in the Wilderness; whereon whosoever looks, with faith
 and obedience, shall be healed of all woes and serpent-bites. We may answer, it will at least prove a symbolic Banner; round
 which the exasperating complaining Twenty-Five Millions,
 otherwise isolated and without power, may rally, and work—what it
 is in them to work. If battle must be the work, as one cannot
 help expecting, then shall it be a battle-banner (say, an Italian
 Gonfalon, in its old Republican _Carroccio_); and shall tower up,
 car-borne, shining in the wind: and with iron tongue peal forth
 many a signal. A thing of prime necessity; which whether in the
 van or in the centre, whether leading or led and driven, must do
 the fighting multitude incalculable services. For a season, while
 it floats in the very front, nay as it were stands solitary
 there, waiting whether force will gather round it, this same
 National _Carroccio_, and the signal-peals it rings, are a main
 object with us. The omen of the “slouch-hats clapt on” shows the Commons Deputies
 to have made up their minds on one thing: that neither Noblesse
 nor Clergy shall have precedence of them; hardly even Majesty
 itself. To such length has the _Contrat Social_, and force of
 public opinion, carried us. For what is Majesty but the Delegate
 of the Nation; delegated, and bargained with (even rather
 tightly),—in some very singular posture of affairs, which Jean
 Jacques has not fixed the date of? Coming therefore into their Hall, on the morrow, an inorganic
 mass of Six Hundred individuals, these Commons Deputies perceive,
 without terror, that they have it all to themselves. Their Hall
 is also the Grand or general Hall for all the Three Orders. But
 the Noblesse and Clergy, it would seem, have retired to their two
 separate Apartments, or Halls; and are there “verifying their
 powers,” not in a conjoint but in a separate capacity. They are
 to constitute two separate, perhaps separately-voting Orders,
 then? It is as if both Noblesse and Clergy had silently taken for
 granted that they already were such! Two Orders against one; and
 so the Third Order to be left in a perpetual minority? Much may remain unfixed; but the negative of that is a thing
 fixed: in the Slouch-hatted heads, in the French Nation’s head.
 Double representation, and all else hitherto gained, were
 otherwise futile, null. Doubtless, the “powers must be
 verified;”—doubtless, the Commission, the electoral Documents of
 your Deputy must be inspected by his brother Deputies, and found
 valid: it is the preliminary of all. Neither is this question, of
 doing it separately or doing it conjointly, a vital one: but if
 it lead to such? It must be resisted; wise was that maxim, Resist
 the beginnings! Nay were resistance unadvisable, even dangerous,
 yet surely pause is very natural: pause, with Twenty-five
 Millions behind you, may become resistance enough.—The inorganic
 mass of Commons Deputies will restrict itself to a “system of
 inertia,” and for the present remain inorganic. Such method, recommendable alike to sagacity and to timidity, do
 the Commons Deputies adopt; and, not without adroitness, and with
 ever more tenacity, they persist in it, day after day, week after
 week. For six weeks their history is of the kind named barren;
 which indeed, as Philosophy knows, is often the fruitfulest of
 all. These were their still creation-days; wherein they sat
 incubating! In fact, what they did was to do nothing, in a
 judicious manner. Daily the inorganic body reassembles; regrets
 that they cannot get organisation, “verification of powers in
 common, and begin regenerating France. Headlong motions may be
 made, but let such be repressed; inertia alone is at once
 unpunishable and unconquerable. Cunning must be met by cunning; proud pretension by inertia, by a
 low tone of patriotic sorrow; low, but incurable, unalterable.
 Wise as serpents; harmless as doves: what a spectacle for France!
 Six Hundred inorganic individuals, essential for its regeneration
 and salvation, sit there, on their elliptic benches, longing
 passionately towards life; in painful durance; like souls waiting
 to be born. Speeches are spoken; eloquent; audible within doors
 and without. Mind agitates itself against mind; the Nation looks
 on with ever deeper interest. Thus do the Commons Deputies sit
 incubating. There are private conclaves, supper-parties, consultations;
 Breton Club, Club of Viroflay; germs of many Clubs. Wholly an
 element of confused noise, dimness, angry heat;—wherein, however,
 the Eros-egg, kept at the fit temperature, may hover safe,
 unbroken till it be hatched. In your Mouniers, Malouets,
 Lechapeliers in science sufficient for that; fervour in your
 Barnaves, Rabauts. At times shall come an inspiration from royal
 Mirabeau: he is nowise yet recognised as royal; nay he was
 “groaned at,” when his name was first mentioned: but he is
 struggling towards recognition.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' In the course of the week, the Commons having called their Eldest
 to the chair, and furnished him with young stronger-lunged
 assistants,—can speak articulately; and, in audible lamentable
 words, declare, as we said, that they are an inorganic body,
 longing to become organic. Letters arrive; but an inorganic body
 cannot open letters; they lie on the table unopened. The Eldest
 may at most procure for himself some kind of List or Muster-roll,
 to take the votes by, and wait what will betide. Noblesse and
 Clergy are all elsewhere: however, an eager public crowds all
 galleries and vacancies; which is some comfort. With effort, it
 is determined, not that a Deputation shall be sent,—for how can
 an inorganic body send deputations?—but that certain individual
 Commons Members shall, in an accidental way, stroll into the
 Clergy Chamber, and then into the Noblesse one; and mention
 there, as a thing they have happened to observe, that the Commons
 seem to be sitting waiting for them, in order to verify their
 powers. That is the wiser method! The Clergy, among whom are such a multitude of Undignified, of
 mere Commons in Curates’ frocks, depute instant respectful answer
 that they are, and will now more than ever be, in deepest study
 as to that very matter. Contrariwise the Noblesse, in cavalier
 attitude, reply, after four days, that they, for their part, are
 all verified and constituted; which, they had trusted, the
 Commons also were; such _separate_ verification being clearly the
 proper constitutional wisdom-of-ancestors method;—as they the
 Noblesse will have much pleasure in demonstrating by a Commission
 of their number, if the Commons will meet them, Commission
 against Commission! Directly in the rear of which comes a
 deputation of Clergy, reiterating, in their insidious
 conciliatory way, the same proposal. Here, then, is a complexity:
 what will wise Commons say to this? Warily, inertly, the wise Commons, considering that they are, if
 not a French Third Estate, at least an Aggregate of individuals
 pretending to some title of that kind, determine, after talking
 on it five days, to name such a Commission,—though, as it were,
 with proviso not to be convinced: a sixth day is taken up in
 naming it; a seventh and an eighth day in getting the forms of
 meeting, place, hour and the like, settled: so that it is not
 till the evening of the 23rd of May that Noblesse Commission
 first meets Commons Commission, Clergy acting as Conciliators;
 and begins the impossible task of convincing it. One other
 meeting, on the 25th, will suffice: the Commons are
 inconvincible, the Noblesse and Clergy irrefragably convincing;
 the Commissions retire; each Order persisting in its first
 pretensions.[142] Thus have three weeks passed. For three weeks, the Third-Estate
 Carroccio, with far-seen Gonfalon, has stood stockstill, flouting
 the wind; waiting what force would gather round it. Fancy can conceive the feeling of the Court; and how counsel met
 counsel, the loud-sounding inanity whirled in that distracted
 vortex, where wisdom could not dwell. Your cunningly devised
 Taxing-Machine has been got together; set up with incredible
 labour; and stands there, its three pieces in contact; its two
 fly-wheels of Noblesse and Clergy, its huge working-wheel of
 Tiers-Etat. The two fly-wheels whirl in the softest manner; but,
 prodigious to look upon, the huge working-wheel hangs motionless,
 refuses to stir! The cunningest engineers are at fault. How
 _will_ it work, when it does begin? Fearfully, my Friends; and to
 many purposes; but to gather taxes, or grind court-meal, one may
 apprehend, never. Could we but have continued gathering taxes _by
 hand!_ Messeigneurs d’Artois, Conti, Condé (named Court
 Triumvirate), they of the anti-democratic _Mémoire au Roi_, has
 not their foreboding proved true? They may wave reproachfully
 their high heads; they may beat their poor brains; but the
 cunningest engineers can do nothing. Necker himself, were he even
 listened to, begins to look blue. The only thing one sees
 advisable is to bring up soldiers. New regiments, two, and a
 battalion of a third, have already reached Paris; others shall
 get in march. Good were it, in all circumstances, to have troops
 within reach; good that the command were in sure hands. Let
 Broglie be appointed; old Marshal Duke de Broglie; veteran
 disciplinarian, of a firm drill-sergeant morality, such as may be
 depended on. For, alas, neither are the Clergy, or the very Noblesse what they
 should be; and might be, when so menaced from without: entire,
 undivided within. The Noblesse, indeed, have their Catiline or
 Crispin D’Espréménil, dusky-glowing, all in renegade heat; their
 boisterous Barrel-Mirabeau; but also they have their Lafayettes,
 Liancourts, Lameths; above all, their D’Orléans, now cut forever
 from his Court-moorings, and musing drowsily of high and highest
 sea-prizes (for is not he too a son of Henri Quatre, and partial
 potential Heir-Apparent?)—on his voyage towards Chaos. From the
 Clergy again, so numerous are the Curés, actual deserters have
 run over: two small parties; in the second party Curé Gregoire.
 Nay there is talk of a whole Hundred and Forty-nine of them about
 to desert in mass, and only restrained by an Archbishop of Paris.
 It seems a losing game. But judge if France, if Paris sat idle, all this while! Addresses
 from far and near flow in: for our Commons have now grown organic
 enough to open letters. Or indeed to cavil at them! Thus poor
 Marquis de Brézé, Supreme Usher, Master of Ceremonies, or
 whatever his title was, writing about this time on some
 ceremonial matter, sees no harm in winding up with a “Monsieur,
 yours with sincere attachment.”—‘To whom does it address itself,
 this sincere attachment?’ inquires Mirabeau. ‘To the Dean of the
 Tiers-Etat.’—‘There is no man in France entitled to write that,’
 rejoins he; whereat the Galleries and the World will not be kept
 from applauding.[143] Poor De Brézé! These Commons have a still
 older grudge at him; nor has he yet done with them. In another way, Mirabeau has had to protest against the quick
 suppression of his Newspaper, _Journal of the
 States-General;_—and to continue it under a new name. In which
 act of valour, the Paris Electors, still busy redacting their
 _Cahier_, could not but support him, by Address to his Majesty:
 they claim utmost “provisory freedom of the press;” they have
 spoken even about demolishing the Bastille, and erecting a Bronze
 Patriot King on the site!—These are the rich Burghers: but now
 consider how it went, for example, with such loose miscellany,
 now all grown eleutheromaniac, of Loungers, Prowlers, social
 Nondescripts (and the distilled Rascality of our Planet), as
 whirls forever in the Palais Royal;—or what low infinite groan,
 first changing into a growl, comes from Saint-Antoine, and the
 Twenty-five Millions in danger of starvation! There is the indisputablest scarcity of corn;—be it
 Aristocrat-plot, D’Orléans-plot, of this year; or drought and
 hail of last year: in city and province, the poor man looks
 desolately towards a nameless lot. And this States-General, that
 could make us an age of gold, is forced to stand motionless;
 cannot get its powers verified! All industry necessarily
 languishes, if it be not that of making motions. In the Palais Royal there has been erected, apparently by
 subscription, a kind of Wooden Tent (_en planches de
 bois_);[144]—most convenient; where select Patriotism can now
 redact resolutions, deliver harangues, with comfort, let the
 weather but as it will. Lively is that Satan-at-Home! On his
 table, on his chair, in every _café_, stands a patriotic orator;
 a crowd round him within; a crowd listening from without,
 open-mouthed, through open door and window; with “thunders of
 applause for every sentiment of more than common hardiness.” In
 Monsieur Dessein’s Pamphlet-shop, close by, you cannot without
 strong elbowing get to the counter: every hour produces its
 pamphlet, or litter of pamphlets; “there were thirteen today,
 sixteen yesterday, nine-two last week.”[145] Think of Tyranny and
 Scarcity; Fervid-eloquence, Rumour, Pamphleteering; _Societé
 Publicole_, Breton Club, Enraged Club;—and whether every
 tap-room, coffee-room, social reunion, accidental street-group,
 over wide France, was not an Enraged Club! To all which the Commons Deputies can only listen with a sublime
 inertia of sorrow; reduced to busy themselves “with their
 internal police.” Surer position no Deputies ever occupied; if
 they keep it with skill. Let not the temperature rise too high;
 break not the Eros-egg till it be hatched, till it break itself!
 An eager public crowds all Galleries and vacancies! “cannot be
 restrained from applauding.” The two Privileged Orders, the
 Noblesse all verified and constituted, may look on with what face
 they will; not without a secret tremor of heart. The Clergy,
 always acting the part of conciliators, make a clutch at the
 Galleries, and the popularity there; and miss it. Deputation of
 them arrives, with dolorous message about the “dearth of grains,”
 and the necessity there is of casting aside vain formalities, and
 deliberating on this. An insidious proposal; which, however, the
 Commons (moved thereto by seagreen Robespierre) dexterously
 accept as a sort of hint, or even pledge, that the Clergy will
 forthwith come over to them, constitute the States-General, and
 so cheapen grains![146]—Finally, on the 27th day of May,
 Mirabeau, judging the time now nearly come, proposes that “the
 inertia cease;” that, leaving the Noblesse to their own stiff
 ways, the Clergy be summoned, “in the name of the God of Peace,”
 to join the Commons, and begin.[147] To which summons if they
 turn a deaf ear,—we shall see! Are not one Hundred and Forty-nine
 of them ready to desert? O Triumvirate of Princes, new Garde-des-Sceaux Barentin, thou
 Home-Secretary Bréteuil, Duchess Polignac, and Queen eager to
 listen,—what is now to be done? This Third Estate will get in
 motion, with the force of all France in it; Clergy-machinery with
 Noblesse-machinery, which were to serve as beautiful
 counter-balances and drags, will be shamefully dragged after
 it,—and take fire along with it. What is to be done? The
 Œil-de-Bœuf waxes more confused than ever. Whisper and
 counter-whisper; a very tempest of whispers! Leading men from all
 the Three Orders are nightly spirited thither; conjurors many of
 them; but can they conjure this? Necker himself were now welcome,
 could he interfere to purpose. Let Necker interfere, then; and in the King’s name! Happily that
 incendiary “God-of-Peace” message is not yet _answered_. The
 Three Orders shall again have conferences; under this Patriot
 Minister of theirs, somewhat may be healed, clouted up;—we
 meanwhile getting forward Swiss Regiments, and a “hundred pieces
 of field-artillery.” This is what the Œil-de-Bœuf, for its part,
 resolves on. But as for Necker—Alas, poor Necker, thy obstinate Third Estate
 has one first-last word, _verification in common_, as the pledge
 of voting and deliberating in common! Half-way proposals, from
 such a tried friend, they answer with a stare. The tardy
 conferences speedily break up; the Third Estate, now ready and
 resolute, the whole world backing it, returns to its Hall of the
 Three Orders; and Necker to the Œil-de-Bœuf, with the character
 of a disconjured conjuror there—fit only for dismissal.[148] And so the Commons Deputies are at last on their own strength
 getting under way? Instead of Chairman, or Dean, they have now
 got a President: Astronomer Bailly. Under way, with a vengeance!
 With endless vociferous and temperate eloquence, borne on
 Newspaper wings to all lands, they have now, on this 17th day of
 June, determined that their name is not _Third Estate_,
 but—_National Assembly!_ They, then, are the Nation? Triumvirate
 of Princes, Queen, refractory Noblesse and Clergy, what, then,
 are _you?_ A most deep question;—scarcely answerable in living
 political dialects. All regardless of which, our new National Assembly proceeds to
 appoint a “committee of subsistences;” dear to France, though it
 can find little or no grain. Next, as if our National Assembly
 stood quite firm on its legs,—to appoint “four other standing
 committees;” then to settle the security of the National Debt;
 then that of the Annual Taxation: all within eight-and-forty
 hours. At such rate of velocity it is going: the conjurors of the
 Œil-de-Bœuf may well ask themselves, Whither?
 Chapter 1.5.II.
 Mercury de Brézé. Now surely were the time for a “god from the machine;” there is a
 _nodus_ worthy of one. The only question is, Which god? Shall it
 be Mars de Broglie, with his hundred pieces of cannon?—Not yet,
 answers prudence; so soft, irresolute is King Louis. Let it be
 Messenger _Mercury_, our Supreme Usher de Brézé. On the morrow, which is the 20th of June, these Hundred and
 Forty-nine false Curates, no longer restrainable by his Grace of
 Paris, will desert in a body: let De Brézé intervene, and
 produce—closed doors! Not only shall there be Royal Session, in
 that Salle des Menus; but no meeting, nor working (except by
 carpenters), till then. Your Third Estate, self-styled “National
 Assembly,” shall suddenly see itself extruded from its Hall, by
 carpenters, in this dexterous way; and reduced to do nothing, not
 even to meet, or articulately lament,—till Majesty, with _Séance
 Royale_ and new miracles, be ready! In this manner shall De
 Brézé, as Mercury _ex machinâ_, intervene; and, if the
 Œil-de-Bœuf mistake not, work deliverance from the _nodus_. Of poor De Brézé we can remark that he has yet prospered in none
 of his dealings with these Commons. Five weeks ago, when they
 kissed the hand of Majesty, the mode he took got nothing but
 censure; and then his “sincere attachment,” how was it scornfully
 whiffed aside! Before supper, this night, he writes to President
 Bailly, a new Letter, to be delivered shortly after dawn
 tomorrow, in the King’s name. Which Letter, however, Bailly in
 the pride of office, will merely crush together into his pocket,
 like a bill he does not mean to pay. Accordingly on Saturday morning the 20th of June, shrill-sounding
 heralds proclaim through the streets of Versailles, that there is
 to be a _Séance Royale_ next Monday; and no meeting of the
 States-General till then. And yet, we observe, President Bailly
 in sound of this, and with De Brézé’s Letter in his pocket, is
 proceeding, with National Assembly at his heels, to the
 accustomed Salles des Menus; as if De Brézé and heralds were mere
 wind. It is shut, this Salle; occupied by Gardes Françaises.
 ‘Where is your Captain?’ The Captain shows his royal order:
 workmen, he is grieved to say, are all busy setting up the
 platform for his Majesty’s _Séance;_ most unfortunately, no
 admission; admission, at furthest, for President and Secretaries
 to bring away papers, which the joiners might destroy!—President
 Bailly enters with Secretaries; and returns bearing papers: alas,
 within doors, instead of patriotic eloquence, there is now no
 noise but hammering, sawing, and operative screeching and
 rumbling! A profanation without parallel. The Deputies stand grouped on the Paris Road, on this umbrageous
 _Avenue de Versailles;_ complaining aloud of the indignity done
 them. Courtiers, it is supposed, look from their windows, and
 giggle. The morning is none of the comfortablest: raw; it is even
 drizzling a little.[149] But all travellers pause; patriot
 gallery-men, miscellaneous spectators increase the groups. Wild
 counsels alternate. Some desperate Deputies propose to go and
 hold session on the great outer Staircase at Marly, under the
 King’s windows; for his Majesty, it seems, has driven over
 thither. Others talk of making the Château Forecourt, what they
 call _Place d’Armes_, a Runnymede and new _Champ de Mai_ of free
 Frenchmen: nay of awakening, to sounds of indignant Patriotism,
 the echoes of the Œil-de-boeuf itself.—Notice is given that
 President Bailly, aided by judicious Guillotin and others, has
 found place in the Tennis-Court of the Rue St. François. Thither,
 in long-drawn files, hoarse-jingling, like cranes on wing, the
 Commons Deputies angrily wend. Strange sight was this in the Rue St. François, Vieux Versailles!
 A naked Tennis-Court, as the pictures of that time still give it:
 four walls; naked, except aloft some poor wooden penthouse, or
 roofed spectators’-gallery, hanging round them:—on the floor not
 now an idle teeheeing, a snapping of balls and rackets; but the
 bellowing din of an indignant National Representation,
 scandalously exiled hither! However, a cloud of witnesses looks
 down on them, from wooden penthouse, from wall-top, from
 adjoining roof and chimney; rolls towards them from all quarters,
 with passionate spoken blessings. Some table can be procured to
 write on; some chair, if not to sit on, then to stand on. The
 Secretaries undo their tapes; Bailly has constituted the
 Assembly. Experienced Mounier, not wholly new to such things, in
 Parlementary revolts, which he has seen or heard of, thinks that
 it were well, in these lamentable threatening circumstances, to
 unite themselves by an Oath.—Universal acclamation, as from
 smouldering bosoms getting vent! The Oath is redacted; pronounced
 aloud by President Bailly,—and indeed in such a sonorous tone,
 that the cloud of witnesses, even outdoors, hear it, and bellow
 response to it. Six hundred right-hands rise with President
 Bailly’s, to take God above to witness that they will not
 separate for man below, but will meet in all places, under all
 circumstances, wheresoever two or three can get together, till
 they have made the Constitution. Made the Constitution, Friends!
 That is a long task. Six hundred hands, meanwhile, will sign as
 they have sworn: six hundred save one; one Loyalist Abdiel, still
 visible by this sole light-point, and nameable, poor “M. Martin
 d’Auch, from Castelnaudary, in Languedoc.” Him they permit to
 sign or signify refusal; they even save him from the cloud of
 witnesses, by declaring “his head deranged.” At four o’clock, the
 signatures are all appended; new meeting is fixed for Monday
 morning, earlier than the hour of the Royal Session; that our
 Hundred and Forty-nine Clerical deserters be not balked: we shall
 meet “at the Recollets Church or elsewhere,” in hope that our
 Hundred and Forty-nine will join us;—and now it is time to go to
 dinner. This, then, is the Session of the Tennis-Court, famed _Séance du
 Jeu de Paume;_ the fame of which has gone forth to all lands.
 This is Mercurius de Brézé’s appearance as _Deus ex machinâ;_
 this is the fruit it brings! The giggle of Courtiers in the
 Versailles Avenue has already died into gaunt silence. Did the
 distracted Court, with Gardes-des-Sceaux Barentin, Triumvirate
 and Company, imagine that they could scatter six hundred National
 Deputies, big with a National Constitution, like as much barndoor
 poultry, big with next to nothing,—by the white or black rod of a
 Supreme Usher? Barndoor poultry fly cackling: but National
 Deputies turn round, lion-faced; and, with uplifted right-hand,
 swear an Oath that makes the four corners of France tremble. President Bailly has covered himself with honour; which shall
 become rewards. The National Assembly is now doubly and trebly
 the Nation’s Assembly; not militant, martyred only, but
 triumphant; insulted, and which could not _be_ insulted. Paris
 disembogues itself once more, to witness, “with grim looks,” the
 _Séance Royale:_[150] which, by a new felicity, is postponed till
 Tuesday. The Hundred and Forty-nine, and even with Bishops among
 them, all in processional mass, have had free leisure to march
 off, and solemnly join the Commons sitting waiting in their
 Church. The Commons welcomed them with shouts, with embracings,
 nay with tears;[151] for it is growing a life-and-death matter
 now. As for the _Séance_ itself, the Carpenters seem to have
 accomplished their platform; but all else remains unaccomplished.
 Futile, we may say fatal, was the whole matter. King Louis
 enters, through seas of people, all grim-silent, angry with many
 things,—for it is a bitter rain too. Enters, to a Third Estate,
 likewise grim-silent; which has been wetted waiting under mean
 porches, at back-doors, while Court and Privileged were entering
 by the front. King and Garde-des-Sceaux (there is no Necker
 visible) make known, not without longwindedness, the
 determinations of the royal breast. The Three Orders _shall_ vote
 separately. On the other hand, France may look for considerable
 constitutional blessings; as specified in these Five-and-thirty
 Articles,[152] which Garde-des-Sceaux is waxing hoarse with
 reading. Which Five-and-Thirty Articles, adds his Majesty again
 rising, if the Three Orders most unfortunately cannot agree
 together to effect them, I myself will effect: ‘_seul je ferai le
 bien de mes peuples_,’—which being interpreted may signify, You,
 contentious Deputies of the States-General, have probably not
 long to be here! But, in fine, all shall now withdraw for this
 day; and meet again, each Order in its separate place, tomorrow
 morning, for despatch of business. _This_ is the determination of
 the royal breast: pithy and clear. And herewith King, retinue,
 Noblesse, majority of Clergy file out, as if the whole matter
 were satisfactorily completed. These file out; through grim-silent seas of people. Only the
 Commons Deputies file not out; but stand there in gloomy silence,
 uncertain what they shall do. One man of them is certain; one man
 of them discerns and dares! It is now that King Mirabeau starts
 to the Tribune, and lifts up his lion-voice. Verily a word in
 season; for, in such scenes, the moment is the mother of ages!
 Had not Gabriel Honoré been there,—one can well fancy, how the
 Commons Deputies, affrighted at the perils which now yawned dim
 all round them, and waxing ever paler in each other’s paleness,
 might very naturally, one after one, have _glided off;_ and the
 whole course of European History have been different! But he is there. List to the _brool_ of that royal forest-voice;
 sorrowful, low; fast swelling to a roar! Eyes kindle at the
 glance of his eye:—National Deputies were missioned by a Nation;
 they have sworn an Oath; they—but lo! while the lion’s voice
 roars loudest, what Apparition is this? Apparition of Mercurius
 de Brézé, muttering somewhat!—‘Speak out,’ cry
 several.—‘Messieurs,’ shrills De Brézé, repeating himself, ‘You
 have heard the King’s orders!’—Mirabeau glares on him with
 fire-flashing face; shakes the black lion’s mane: ‘Yes, Monsieur,
 we have heard what the King was advised to say: and you who
 cannot be the interpreter of his orders to the States-General;
 you, who have neither place nor right of speech here; _you_ are
 not the man to remind us of it. Go, Monsieur, tell these who sent
 you that we are here by the will of the People, and that nothing
 shall send us hence but the force of bayonets!’[153] And poor De
 Brézé shivers forth from the National Assembly;—and also (if it
 be not in one faintest glimmer, months later) finally from the
 page of History!— Hapless De Brézé; doomed to survive long ages, in men’s memory,
 in this faint way, with tremulent white rod! He was true to
 Etiquette, which was his Faith here below; a martyr to respect of
 persons. Short woollen cloaks could not kiss Majesty’s hand as
 long velvet ones did. Nay lately, when the poor little Dauphin
 lay dead, and some ceremonial Visitation came, was he not
 punctual to announce it even to the Dauphin’s _dead body:_
 ‘Monseigneur, a Deputation of the States-General!’[154] _Sunt
 lachrymæ rerum._ But what does the Œil-de-Bœuf, now when De Brézé shivers back
 thither? _Despatch_ that same force of bayonets? Not so: the seas
 of people still hang multitudinous, intent on what is passing;
 nay rush and roll, loud-billowing, into the Courts of the Château
 itself; for a report has risen that Necker is to be dismissed.
 Worst of all, the Gardes Françaises seem indisposed to act: “two
 Companies of them _do not fire_ when ordered!”[155] Necker, for
 not being at the _Séance_, shall be shouted for, carried home in
 triumph; and must not be dismissed. His Grace of Paris, on the
 other hand, has to fly with broken coach-panels, and owe his life
 to furious driving. The _Gardes-du-Corps_ (Body-Guards), which
 you were drawing out, had better be drawn in again.[156] There is
 no sending of bayonets to be thought of. Instead of soldiers, the Œil-de-Bœuf sends—carpenters, to take
 down the platform. Ineffectual shift! In few instants, the very
 carpenters cease wrenching and knocking at their platform; stand
 on it, hammer in hand, and listen open-mouthed.[157] The Third
 Estate is decreeing that it is, was, and will be, nothing but a
 National Assembly; and now, moreover, an inviolable one, all
 members of it inviolable: “infamous, traitorous, towards the
 Nation, and guilty of capital crime, is any person,
 body-corporate, tribunal, court or commission that now or
 henceforth, during the present session or after it, shall dare to
 pursue, interrogate, arrest, or cause to be arrested, detain or
 cause to be detained, any,” &c. &c. “_on whose part soever_ the
 same be commanded.”[158] Which done, one can wind up with this
 comfortable reflection from Abbé Sieyes: ‘Messieurs, you are
 today what you were yesterday.’ Courtiers may shriek; but it is, and remains, even so. Their
 well-charged explosion has exploded _through the touch-hole;_
 covering themselves with scorches, confusion, and unseemly soot!
 Poor Triumvirate, poor Queen; and above all, poor Queen’s
 Husband, who means well, had he any fixed meaning! Folly is that
 wisdom which is wise only behindhand. Few months ago these
 Thirty-five Concessions had filled France with a rejoicing, which
 might have lasted for several years. Now it is unavailing, the
 very mention of it slighted; Majesty’s express orders set at
 nought. All France is in a roar; a sea of persons, estimated at “ten
 thousand,” whirls “all this day in the Palais Royal.”[159] The
 remaining Clergy, and likewise some Forty-eight Noblesse,
 D’Orléans among them, have now forthwith gone over to the
 victorious Commons; by whom, as is natural, they are received
 “with acclamation.” The Third Estate triumphs; Versailles Town shouting round it; ten
 thousand whirling all day in the Palais Royal; and all France
 standing a-tiptoe, not unlike whirling! Let the Œil-de-Bœuf look
 to it. As for King Louis, he will swallow his injuries; will
 temporise, keep silence; will at all costs have present peace. It
 was Tuesday the 23d of June, when he spoke that peremptory royal
 mandate; and the week is not done till he has written to the
 remaining obstinate Noblesse, that they also must oblige him, and
 give in. D’Espréménil rages his last; Barrel Mirabeau “breaks his
 sword,” making a vow,—which he might as well have kept. The
 “Triple Family” is now therefore complete; the third erring
 brother, the Noblesse, having joined it;—erring but pardonable;
 soothed, so far as possible, by sweet eloquence from President
 Bailly. So triumphs the Third Estate; and States-General are become
 National Assembly; and all France may sing _Te Deum_. By wise
 inertia, and wise cessation of inertia, great victory has been
 gained. It is the last night of June: all night you meet nothing
 on the streets of Versailles but “men running with torches” with
 shouts of jubilation. From the 2nd of May when they kissed the
 hand of Majesty, to this 30th of June when men run with torches,
 we count seven weeks complete. For seven weeks the National
 Carroccio has stood far-seen, ringing many a signal; and, so much
 having now gathered round it, may hope to stand.
 Chapter 1.5.III.
 Broglie the War-God. The Court feels indignant that it is conquered; but what then?
 Another time it will do better. Mercury descended in vain; now
 has the time come for Mars.—The gods of the Œil-de-Bœuf have
 withdrawn into the darkness of their cloudy Ida; and sit there,
 shaping and forging what may be needful, be it “billets of a new
 National Bank,” munitions of war, or things forever inscrutable
 to men. Accordingly, what means this “apparatus of troops”? The National
 Assembly can get no furtherance for its Committee of
 Subsistences; can hear only that, at Paris, the Bakers’ shops are
 besieged; that, in the Provinces, people are living on
 “meal-husks and boiled grass.” But on all highways there hover
 dust-clouds, with the march of regiments, with the trailing of
 cannon: foreign Pandours, of fierce aspect; Salis-Samade,
 Esterhazy, Royal-Allemand; so many of them foreign, to the number
 of thirty thousand,—which fear can magnify to fifty: all wending
 towards Paris and Versailles! Already, on the heights of
 Montmartre, is a digging and delving; too like a scarping and
 trenching. The effluence of Paris is arrested Versailles-ward by
 a barrier of cannon at Sèvres Bridge. From the Queen’s Mews,
 cannon stand pointed on the National Assembly Hall itself. The
 National Assembly has its very slumbers broken by the tramp of
 soldiery, swarming and defiling, endless, or seemingly endless,
 all round those spaces, at dead of night, “without drum-music,
 without audible word of command.”[160] What means it? Shall eight, or even shall twelve Deputies, our Mirabeaus,
 Barnaves at the head of them, be whirled suddenly to the Castle
 of Ham; the rest ignominiously dispersed to the winds? No
 National Assembly can make the Constitution with cannon levelled
 on it from the Queen’s Mews! What means this reticence of the
 Œil-de-Bœuf, broken only by nods and shrugs? In the mystery of
 that cloudy Ida, what is it that they forge and shape?—Such
 questions must distracted Patriotism keep asking, and receive no
 answer but an echo. Enough of themselves! But now, above all, while the hungry
 food-year, which runs from August to August, is getting older;
 becoming more and more a famine-year? With “meal-husks and boiled
 grass,” Brigands may actually collect; and, in crowds, at farm
 and mansion, howl angrily, _Food! Food!_ It is in vain to send
 soldiers against them: at sight of soldiers they disperse, they
 vanish as under ground; then directly reassemble elsewhere for
 new tumult and plunder. Frightful enough to look upon; but what
 to _hear_ of, reverberated through Twenty-five Millions of
 suspicious minds! Brigands and Broglie, open Conflagration,
 preternatural Rumour are driving mad most hearts in France. What
 will the issue of these things be?');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' At Marseilles, many weeks ago, the Townsmen have taken arms; for
 “suppressing of Brigands,” and other purposes: the military
 commandant may make of it what he will. Elsewhere, everywhere,
 could not the like be done? Dubious, on the distracted Patriot
 imagination, wavers, as a last deliverance, some foreshadow of a
 _National Guard_. But conceive, above all, the Wooden Tent in the
 Palais Royal! A universal hubbub there, as of dissolving worlds:
 their loudest bellows the mad, mad-making voice of Rumour; their
 sharpest gazes Suspicion into the pale dim World-Whirlpool;
 discerning shapes and phantasms; imminent bloodthirsty Regiments
 camped on the Champ-de-Mars; dispersed National Assembly; redhot
 cannon-balls (to burn Paris);—the mad War-god and Bellona’s
 sounding thongs. To the calmest man it is becoming too plain that
 battle is inevitable. Inevitable, silently nod Messeigneurs and Broglie: Inevitable and
 brief! Your National Assembly, stopped short in its
 Constitutional labours, may fatigue the royal ear with addresses
 and remonstrances: those cannon of ours stand duly levelled;
 those troops are here. The King’s Declaration, with its
 Thirty-five too generous Articles, was spoken, was not listened
 to; but remains yet unrevoked: he himself shall effect it, _seul
 il fera!_ As for Broglie, he has his headquarters at Versailles, all as in
 a seat of war: clerks writing; significant staff-officers,
 inclined to taciturnity; plumed aides-de-camp, scouts, orderlies
 flying or hovering. He himself looks forth, important,
 impenetrable; listens to Besenval Commandant of Paris, and his
 warning and earnest counsels (for he has come out repeatedly on
 purpose), with a silent smile.[161] The Parisians resist?
 scornfully cry Messeigneurs. As a meal-mob may! They have sat
 quiet, these five generations, submitting to all. Their Mercier
 declared, in these very years, that a Parisian revolt was
 henceforth “impossible.”[162] Stand by the royal Declaration, of
 the Twenty-third of June. The Nobles of France, valorous,
 chivalrous as of old, will rally round us with one heart;—and as
 for this which you call Third Estate, and which we call
 _canaille_ of unwashed Sansculottes, of Patelins, Scribblers,
 factious Spouters,—brave Broglie, “with a whiff of grapeshot
 (_salve de canons_),” if need be, will give quick account of it.
 Thus reason they: on their cloudy Ida; hidden from men,—men also
 hidden from them. Good is grapeshot, Messeigneurs, on one condition: that the
 shooter also were made of metal! But unfortunately he is made of
 flesh; under his buffs and bandoleers your hired shooter has
 instincts, feelings, even a kind of thought. It is his kindred,
 bone of his bone, this same _canaille_ that shall be whiffed; he
 has brothers in it, a father and mother,—living on meal-husks and
 boiled grass. His very doxy, not yet “dead i’ the spital,” drives
 him into military heterodoxy; declares that if he shed Patriot
 blood, he shall be accursed among men. The soldier, who has seen
 his pay stolen by rapacious Foulons, his blood wasted by
 Soubises, Pompadours, and the gates of promotion shut inexorably
 on him if he were not born noble,—is himself not without griefs
 against you. Your cause is not the soldier’s cause; but, as would
 seem, your own only, and no other god’s nor man’s. For example, the world may have heard how, at Bethune lately,
 when there rose some “riot about grains,” of which sort there are
 so many, and the soldiers stood drawn out, and the word “Fire!
 was given,—not a trigger stirred; only the butts of all muskets
 rattled angrily against the ground; and the soldiers stood
 glooming, with a mixed expression of countenance;—till clutched
 “each under the arm of a patriot householder,” they were all
 hurried off, in this manner, to be treated and caressed, and have
 their pay increased by subscription![163] Neither have the Gardes Françaises, the best regiment of the
 line, shown any promptitude for street-firing lately. They
 returned grumbling from Réveillon’s; and have not burnt a single
 cartridge since; nay, as we saw, not even when bid. A dangerous
 humour dwells in these Gardes. Notable men too, in their way!
 Valadi the Pythagorean was, at one time, an officer of theirs.
 Nay, in the ranks, under the three-cornered felt and cockade,
 what hard heads may there not be, and reflections going
 on,—unknown to the public! One head of the hardest we do now
 discern there: on the shoulders of a certain Sergeant Hoche.
 Lazare Hoche, that is the name of him; he used to be about the
 Versailles Royal Stables, nephew of a poor herbwoman; a handy
 lad; exceedingly addicted to reading. He is now Sergeant Hoche,
 and can rise no farther: he lays out his pay in rushlights, and
 cheap editions of books.[164] On the whole, the best seems to be: Consign these Gardes
 Françaises to their Barracks. So Besenval thinks, and orders.
 Consigned to their barracks, the Gardes Françaises do but form a
 “Secret Association,” an Engagement not to act against the
 National Assembly. Debauched by Valadi the Pythagorean; debauched
 by money and women! cry Besenval and innumerable others.
 Debauched by what you will, or in need of no debauching, behold
 them, long files of them, their consignment broken, arrive,
 headed by their Sergeants, on the 26th day of June, at the Palais
 Royal! Welcomed with vivats, with presents, and a pledge of
 patriot liquor; embracing and embraced; declaring in words that
 the cause of France is their cause! Next day and the following
 days the like. What is singular too, except this patriot humour,
 and breaking of their consignment, they behave otherwise with
 “the most rigorous accuracy.”[165] They are growing questionable, these Gardes! Eleven ring-leaders
 of them are put in the Abbaye Prison. It boots not in the least.
 The imprisoned Eleven have only, “by the hand of an individual,”
 to drop, towards nightfall, a line in the Café de Foy; where
 Patriotism harangues loudest on its table. “Two hundred young
 persons, soon waxing to four thousand,” with fit crowbars, roll
 towards the Abbaye; smite asunder the needful doors; and bear out
 their Eleven, with other military victims:—to supper in the
 Palais Royal Garden; to board, and lodging “in campbeds, in the
 _Théâtre des Variétés;_” other national _Prytaneum_ as yet not
 being in readiness. Most deliberate! Nay so punctual were these
 young persons, that finding one military victim to have been
 imprisoned for real civil crime, they returned him to his cell,
 with protest. Why new military force was not called out? New military force was
 called out. New military force did arrive, full gallop, with
 drawn sabre: but the people gently “laid hold of their bridles;”
 the dragoons sheathed their swords; lifted their caps by way of
 salute, and sat like mere statues of dragoons,—except indeed that
 a drop of liquor being brought them, they “drank to the King and
 Nation with the greatest cordiality.”[166] And now, ask in return, why Messeigneurs and Broglie the great
 god of war, on seeing these things, did not pause, and take some
 other course, any other course? Unhappily, as we said, they could
 see nothing. Pride, which goes before a fall; wrath, if not
 reasonable, yet pardonable, most natural, had hardened their
 hearts and heated their heads; so, with imbecility and violence
 (ill-matched pair), they rush to seek their hour. All Regiments
 are not Gardes Françaises, or debauched by Valadi the
 Pythagorean: let fresh undebauched Regiments come up; let
 Royal-Allemand, Salais-Samade, Swiss Château-Vieux come up,—which
 can fight, but can hardly speak except in German gutturals; let
 soldiers march, and highways thunder with artillery-waggons:
 Majesty has a new Royal Session to hold,—and miracles to work
 there! The whiff of grapeshot can, if needful, become a blast and
 tempest. In which circumstances, before the redhot balls begin raining,
 may not the Hundred-and-twenty Paris Electors, though their
 _Cahier_ is long since finished, see good to meet again daily, as
 an “Electoral Club”? They meet first “in a Tavern;”—where “the
 largest wedding-party” cheerfully give place to them.[167] But
 latterly they meet in the _Hôtel-de-Ville_, in the Townhall
 itself. Flesselles, Provost of Merchants, with his Four Echevins
 (_Scabins_, Assessors), could not prevent it; such was the force
 of public opinion. He, with his Echevins, and the Six-and-Twenty
 Town-Councillors, all appointed from Above, may well sit silent
 there, in their long gowns; and consider, with awed eye, what
 prelude this is of convulsion coming from Below, and how
 themselves shall fare in that!
 Chapter 1.5.IV.
 To Arms! So hangs it, dubious, fateful, in the sultry days of July. It is
 the passionate printed _advice_ of M. Marat, to abstain, of all
 things, from violence.[168] Nevertheless the hungry poor are
 already burning Town Barriers, where Tribute on eatables is
 levied; getting clamorous for food. The twelfth July morning is Sunday; the streets are all placarded
 with an enormous-sized _De par le Roi_, “inviting peaceable
 citizens to remain within doors,” to feel no alarm, to gather in
 no crowd. Why so? What mean these “placards of enormous size”?
 Above all, what means this clatter of military; dragoons,
 hussars, rattling in from all points of the compass towards the
 Place Louis Quinze; with a staid gravity of face, though saluted
 with mere nicknames, hootings and even missiles?[169] Besenval is
 with them. Swiss Guards of his are already in the Champs Elysées,
 with four pieces of artillery. Have the destroyers descended on us, then? From the Bridge of
 Sèvres to utmost Vincennes, from Saint-Denis to the
 Champ-de-Mars, we are begirt! Alarm, of the vague unknown, is in
 every heart. The Palais Royal has become a place of awestruck
 interjections, silent shakings of the head: one can fancy with
 what dolorous sound the noon-tide cannon (which the Sun fires at
 the crossing of his meridian) went off there; bodeful, like an
 inarticulate voice of doom.[170] Are these troops verily come out
 “against Brigands”? Where are the Brigands? What mystery is in
 the wind?—Hark! a human voice reporting articulately the
 Job’s-news: _Necker, People’s Minister, Saviour of France, is
 dismissed_. Impossible; incredible! Treasonous to the public
 peace! Such a voice ought to be choked in the
 water-works;[171]—had not the news-bringer quickly fled.
 Nevertheless, friends, make of it what you will, the news is
 true. Necker is gone. Necker hies northward incessantly, in
 obedient secrecy, since yesternight. We have a new Ministry:
 Broglie the War-god; Aristocrat Bréteuil; Foulon who said the
 people might eat grass! Rumour, therefore, shall arise; in the Palais Royal, and in broad
 France. Paleness sits on every face; confused tremor and
 fremescence; waxing into thunder-peals, of Fury stirred on by
 Fear. But see Camille Desmoulins, from the Café de Foy, rushing out,
 sibylline in face; his hair streaming, in each hand a pistol! He
 springs to a table: the Police satellites are eyeing him; alive
 they shall not take him, not they alive him alive. This time he
 speaks without stammering:—Friends, shall we die like hunted
 hares? Like sheep hounded into their pinfold; bleating for mercy,
 where is no mercy, but only a whetted knife? The hour is come;
 the supreme hour of Frenchman and Man; when Oppressors are to try
 conclusions with Oppressed; and the word is, swift Death, or
 Deliverance forever. Let such hour be _well_-come! Us, meseems,
 one cry only befits: To Arms! Let universal Paris, universal
 France, as with the throat of the whirlwind, sound only: To
 arms!—‘To arms!’ yell responsive the innumerable voices: like one
 great voice, as of a Demon yelling from the air: for all faces
 wax fire-eyed, all hearts burn up into madness. In such, or
 fitter words,[172] does Camille evoke the Elemental Powers, in
 this great moment.—Friends, continues Camille, some rallying
 sign! Cockades; green ones;—the colour of hope!—As with the
 flight of locusts, these green tree leaves; green ribands from
 the neighbouring shops; all green things are snatched, and made
 cockades of. Camille descends from his table, “stifled with
 embraces, wetted with tears;” has a bit of green riband handed
 him; sticks it in his hat. And now to Curtius’ Image-shop there;
 to the Boulevards; to the four winds; and rest not till France be
 on fire! France, so long shaken and wind-parched, is probably at the right
 inflammable point.—As for poor Curtius, who, one grieves to
 think, might be but imperfectly paid,—he cannot make two words
 about his Images. The Wax-bust of Necker, the Wax-bust of
 D’Orléans, helpers of France: these, covered with crape, as in
 funeral procession, or after the manner of suppliants appealing
 to Heaven, to Earth, and Tartarus itself, a mixed multitude bears
 off. For a sign! As indeed man, with his singular imaginative
 faculties, can do little or nothing without signs: thus Turks
 look to their Prophet’s banner; also Osier _Mannikins_ have been
 burnt, and Necker’s Portrait has erewhile figured, aloft on its
 perch. In this manner march they, a mixed, continually increasing
 multitude; armed with axes, staves and miscellanea; grim,
 many-sounding, through the streets. Be all Theatres shut; let all
 dancing, on planked floor, or on the natural greensward, cease!
 Instead of a Christian Sabbath, and feast of _guinguette_
 tabernacles, it shall be a Sorcerer’s Sabbath; and Paris, gone
 rabid, dance,—with the Fiend for piper! However, Besenval, with horse and foot, is in the Place Louis
 Quinze. Mortals promenading homewards, in the fall of the day,
 saunter by, from Chaillot or Passy, from flirtation and a little
 thin wine; with sadder step than usual. Will the Bust-Procession
 pass that way! Behold it; behold also Prince Lambesc dash forth
 on it, with his Royal-Allemands! Shots fall, and sabre-strokes;
 Busts are hewn asunder; and, alas, also heads of men. A sabred
 Procession has nothing for it but to _explode_, along what
 streets, alleys, Tuileries Avenues it finds; and disappear. One
 unarmed man lies hewed down; a Garde Française by his uniform:
 bear him (or bear even the report of him) dead and gory to his
 Barracks;—where he has comrades still alive! But why not now, victorious Lambesc, charge through that
 Tuileries Garden itself, where the fugitives are vanishing? Not
 show the Sunday promenaders too, how steel glitters, besprent
 with blood; that it be told of, and men’s ears tingle?—Tingle,
 alas, they did; but the wrong way. Victorious Lambesc, in this
 his second or Tuileries charge, succeeds but in overturning (call
 it not slashing, for he struck with the flat of his sword) one
 man, a poor old schoolmaster, most pacifically tottering there;
 and is driven out, by barricade of chairs, by flights of “bottles
 and glasses,” by execrations in bass voice and treble. Most
 delicate is the mob-queller’s vocation; wherein Too-much may be
 as bad as Not-enough. For each of these bass voices, and more
 each treble voice, borne to all points of the City, rings now
 nothing but distracted indignation; will ring all another. The
 cry, _To arms!_ roars tenfold; steeples with their metal
 storm-voice boom out, as the sun sinks; armorer’s shops are
 broken open, plundered; the streets are a living foam-sea, chafed
 by all the winds. Such issue came of Lambesc’s charge on the Tuileries Garden: no
 striking of salutary terror into Chaillot promenaders; a striking
 into broad wakefulness of Frenzy and the three Furies,—which
 otherwise were not asleep! For they lie always, those
 subterranean Eumenides (fabulous and yet so true), in the dullest
 existence of man;—and can dance, brandishing their dusky torches,
 shaking their serpent-hair. Lambesc with Royal-Allemand may ride
 to his barracks, with curses for his marching-music; then ride
 back again, like one troubled in mind: vengeful Gardes
 Françaises, _sacre_ing, with knit brows, start out on him, from
 their barracks in the Chaussé d’Antin; pour a volley into him
 (killing and wounding); which he must not answer, but ride
 on.[173] Counsel dwells not under the plumed hat. If the Eumenides awaken,
 and Broglie has given no orders, what can a Besenval do? When the
 Gardes Françaises, with Palais-Royal volunteers, roll down,
 greedy of more vengeance, to the Place Louis Quinze itself, they
 find neither Besenval, Lambesc, Royal-Allemand, nor any soldier
 now there. Gone is military order. On the far Eastern Boulevard,
 of Saint-Antoine, the Chasseurs Normandie arrive, dusty, thirsty,
 after a hard day’s ride; but can find no billet-master, see no
 course in this City of confusions; cannot get to Besenval, cannot
 so much as discover where he is: Normandie must even bivouac
 there, in its dust and thirst,—unless some patriot will treat it
 to a cup of liquor, with advices. Raging multitudes surround the Hôtel-de-Ville, crying: Arms!
 Orders! The Six-and-twenty Town-Councillors, with their long
 gowns, have ducked under (into the raging chaos);—shall never
 emerge more. Besenval is painfully wriggling himself out, to the
 Champ-de-Mars; he must sit there “in the cruelest uncertainty:”
 courier after courier may dash off for Versailles; but will bring
 back no answer, can hardly bring himself back. For the roads are
 all blocked with batteries and pickets, with floods of carriages
 arrested for examination: such was Broglie’s one sole order; the
 Œil-de-Bœuf, hearing in the distance such mad din, which sounded
 almost like invasion, will before all things keep its own head
 whole. A new Ministry, with, as it were, but one foot in the
 stirrup, cannot take leaps. Mad Paris is abandoned altogether to
 itself. What a Paris, when the darkness fell! A European metropolitan
 City hurled suddenly forth from its old combinations and
 arrangements; to crash tumultuously together, seeking new. Use
 and wont will now no longer direct any man; each man, with what
 of originality he has, must begin thinking; or following those
 that think. Seven hundred thousand individuals, on the sudden,
 find all their old paths, old ways of acting and deciding, vanish
 from under their feet. And so there go they, with clangour and
 terror, they know not as yet whether running, swimming or
 flying,—headlong into the New Era. With clangour and terror: from
 above, Broglie the war-god impends, preternatural, with his
 redhot cannon-balls; and from below, a preternatural
 Brigand-world menaces with dirk and firebrand: madness rules the
 hour. Happily, in place of the submerged Twenty-six, the Electoral Club
 is gathering; has declared itself a “Provisional Municipality.”
 On the morrow it will get Provost Flesselles, with an Echevin or
 two, to give help in many things. For the present it decrees one
 most essential thing: that forthwith a “Parisian Militia” shall
 be enrolled. Depart, ye heads of Districts, to labour in this
 great work; while we here, in Permanent Committee, sit alert. Let
 fencible men, each party in its own range of streets, keep watch
 and ward, all night. Let Paris court a little fever-sleep;
 confused by such fever-dreams, of “violent motions at the Palais
 Royal;”—or from time to time start awake, and look out,
 palpitating, in its nightcap, at the clash of discordant
 mutually-unintelligible Patrols; on the gleam of distant
 Barriers, going up all-too ruddy towards the vault of Night.[174]
 Chapter 1.5.V.
 Give us Arms. On Monday the huge City has awoke, not to its week-day industry:
 to what a different one! The working man has become a fighting
 man; has one want only: that of arms. The industry of all crafts
 has paused;—except it be the smith’s, fiercely hammering pikes;
 and, in a faint degree, the kitchener’s, cooking off-hand
 victuals; for _bouche va toujours_. Women too are sewing
 cockades;—not now of green, which being D’Artois colour, the
 Hôtel-de-Ville has had to interfere in it; but of _red_ and
 _blue_, our old Paris colours: these, once based on a ground of
 constitutional _white_, are the famed TRICOLOR,—which (if
 Prophecy err not) “will go round the world.” All shops, unless it be the Bakers’ and Vintners’, are shut:
 Paris is in the streets;—rushing, foaming like some Venice
 wine-glass into which you had dropped poison. The tocsin, by
 order, is pealing madly from all steeples. Arms, ye Elector
 Municipals; thou Flesselles with thy Echevins, give us arms!
 Flesselles gives what he can: fallacious, perhaps insidious
 promises of arms from Charleville; order to seek arms here, order
 to seek them there. The new Municipals give what they can; some
 three hundred and sixty indifferent firelocks, the equipment of
 the City-Watch: “a man in wooden shoes, and without coat,
 directly clutches one of them, and mounts guard.” Also as hinted,
 an order to all Smiths to make pikes with their whole soul. Heads of Districts are in fervent consultation; subordinate
 Patriotism roams distracted, ravenous for arms. Hitherto at the
 Hôtel-de-Ville was only such modicum of indifferent firelocks as
 we have seen. At the so-called Arsenal, there lies nothing but
 rust, rubbish and saltpetre,—overlooked too by the guns of the
 Bastille. His Majesty’s Repository, what they call
 _Garde-Meuble_, is forced and ransacked: tapestries enough, and
 gauderies; but of serviceable fighting-gear small stock! Two
 silver-mounted cannons there are; an ancient gift from his
 Majesty of Siam to Louis Fourteenth: gilt sword of the Good
 Henri; antique Chivalry arms and armour. These, and such as
 these, a necessitous Patriotism snatches greedily, for want of
 better. The Siamese cannons go trundling, on an errand they were
 not meant for. Among the indifferent firelocks are seen
 tourney-lances; the princely helm and hauberk glittering amid
 ill-hatted heads,—as in a time when all times and their
 possessions are suddenly sent jumbling! At the _Maison de Saint-Lazare_, Lazar-House once, now a
 Correction-House with Priests, there was no trace of arms; but,
 on the other hand, corn, plainly to a culpable extent. Out with
 it, to market; in this scarcity of grains!—Heavens, will
 “fifty-two carts,” in long row, hardly carry it to the _Halle aux
 Bleds?_ Well, truly, ye reverend Fathers, was your pantry filled;
 fat are your larders; over-generous your wine-bins, ye plotting
 exasperators of the Poor; traitorous forestallers of bread! Vain is protesting, entreaty on bare knees: the House of
 Saint-Lazarus has that in it which comes not out by protesting.
 Behold, how, from every window, it _vomits:_ mere torrents of
 furniture, of bellowing and hurlyburly;—the cellars also leaking
 wine. Till, as was natural, smoke rose,—kindled, some say, by the
 desperate Saint-Lazaristes themselves, desperate of other
 riddance; and the Establishment vanished from this world in
 flame. Remark nevertheless that “a thief” (set on or not by
 Aristocrats), being detected there, is “instantly hanged.” Look also at the Châtelet Prison. The Debtors’ Prison of La Force
 is broken from without; and they that sat in bondage to
 Aristocrats go free: hearing of which the Felons at the Châtelet
 do likewise “dig up their pavements,” and stand on the offensive;
 with the best prospects,—had not Patriotism, passing that way,
 “fired a volley” into the Felon world; and crushed it down again
 under hatches. Patriotism consorts not with thieving and felony:
 surely also Punishment, this day, hitches (if she still hitch)
 after Crime, with frightful shoes-of-swiftness! “Some score or
 two” of wretched persons, found prostrate with drink in the
 cellars of that Saint-Lazare, are indignantly haled to prison;
 the Jailor has no room; whereupon, other place of security not
 suggesting itself, it is written, “_on les pendit_, they hanged
 them.”[175] Brief is the word; not without significance, be it
 true or untrue! In such circumstances, the Aristocrat, the unpatriotic rich man
 is packing-up for departure. But he shall not get departed. A
 wooden-shod force has seized all Barriers, burnt or not: all that
 enters, all that seeks to issue, is stopped there, and dragged to
 the Hôtel-de-Ville: coaches, tumbrils, plate, furniture, “many
 meal-sacks,” in time even “flocks and herds” encumber the Place
 de Grève.[176] And so it roars, and rages, and brays; drums beating, steeples
 pealing; criers rushing with hand-bells: ‘Oyez, oyez. All men to
 their Districts to be enrolled!’ The Districts have met in
 gardens, open squares; are getting marshalled into volunteer
 troops. No redhot ball has yet fallen from Besenval’s Camp; on
 the contrary, Deserters with their arms are continually dropping
 in: nay now, joy of joys, at two in the afternoon, the Gardes
 Françaises, being ordered to Saint-Denis, and flatly declining,
 have come over in a body! It is a fact worth many. Three thousand
 six hundred of the best fighting men, with complete accoutrement;
 with cannoneers even, and cannon! Their officers are left
 standing alone; could not so much as succeed in “spiking the
 guns.” The very Swiss, it may now be hoped, Château-Vieux and the
 others, will have doubts about fighting. Our Parisian Militia,—which some think it were better to name
 National Guard,—is prospering as heart could wish. It promised to
 be forty-eight thousand; but will in few hours double and
 quadruple that number: invincible, if we had only arms! But see, the promised Charleville Boxes, marked _Artillerie!_
 Here, then, are arms enough?—Conceive the blank face of
 Patriotism, when it found them filled with rags, foul linen,
 candle-ends, and bits of wood! Provost of the Merchants, how is
 this? Neither at the Chartreux Convent, whither we were sent with
 signed order, is there or ever was there any weapon of war. Nay
 here, in this Seine Boat, safe under tarpaulings (had not the
 nose of Patriotism been of the finest), are “five thousand-weight
 of gunpowder;” not coming _in_, but surreptitiously going out!
 What meanest thou, Flesselles? ’Tis a ticklish game, that of
 “amusing” us. Cat plays with captive mouse: but mouse with
 enraged cat, with enraged National Tiger? Meanwhile, the faster, O ye black-aproned Smiths, smite; with
 strong arm and willing heart. This man and that, all stroke from
 head to heel, shall thunder alternating, and ply the great
 forge-hammer, till stithy reel and ring again; while ever and
 anon, overhead, booms the alarm-cannon,—for the City has now got
 gunpowder. Pikes are fabricated; fifty thousand of them, in
 six-and-thirty hours: judge whether the Black-aproned have been
 idle. Dig trenches, unpave the streets, ye others, assiduous, man
 and maid; cram the earth in barrel-barricades, at each of them a
 volunteer sentry; pile the whinstones in window-sills and upper
 rooms. Have scalding pitch, at least boiling water ready, ye weak
 old women, to pour it and dash it on Royal-Allemand, with your
 old skinny arms: your shrill curses along with it will not be
 wanting!—Patrols of the newborn National Guard, bearing torches,
 scour the streets, all that night; which otherwise are vacant,
 yet illuminated in every window by order. Strange-looking; like
 some naphtha-lighted City of the Dead, with here and there a
 flight of perturbed Ghosts. O poor mortals, how ye make this Earth bitter for each other;
 this fearful and wonderful Life fearful and horrible; and Satan
 has his place in all hearts! Such agonies and ragings and
 wailings ye have, and have had, in all times:—to be buried all,
 in so deep silence; and the salt sea is not swoln with your
 tears. Great meanwhile is the moment, when tidings of Freedom reach us;
 when the long-enthralled soul, from amid its chains and squalid
 stagnancy, arises, were it still only in blindness and
 bewilderment, and swears by Him that made it, that it will be
 _free!_ Free? Understand that well, it is the deep commandment,
 dimmer or clearer, of our whole being, to be _free_. Freedom is
 the one purport, wisely aimed at, or unwisely, of all man’s
 struggles, toilings and sufferings, in this Earth. Yes, supreme
 is such a moment (if thou have known it): first vision as of a
 flame-girt Sinai, in this our waste Pilgrimage,—which thenceforth
 wants not its pillar of cloud by day, and pillar of fire by
 night! Something it is even,—nay, something considerable, when
 the chains have grown _corrosive_, poisonous, to be free “from
 oppression by our fellow-man.” Forward, ye maddened sons of
 France; be it towards this destiny or towards that! Around you is
 but starvation, falsehood, corruption and the clam of death.
 Where ye are is no abiding. Imagination may, imperfectly, figure how Commandant Besenval, in
 the Champ-de-Mars, has worn out these sorrowful hours
 Insurrection all round; his men melting away! From Versailles, to
 the most pressing messages, comes no answer; or once only some
 vague word of answer which is worse than none. A Council of
 Officers can decide merely that there is no decision: Colonels
 inform him, “weeping,” that they do not think their men will
 fight. Cruel uncertainty is here: war-god Broglie sits yonder,
 inaccessible in his Olympus; does not descend terror-clad, does
 not produce his whiff of grapeshot; sends no orders. Truly, in the Château of Versailles all seems mystery: in the
 Town of Versailles, were we there, all is rumour, alarm and
 indignation. An august National Assembly sits, to appearance,
 menaced with death; endeavouring to defy death. It has resolved
 “that Necker carries with him the regrets of the Nation.” It has
 sent solemn Deputation over to the Château, with entreaty to have
 these troops withdrawn. In vain: his Majesty, with a singular
 composure, invites us to be busy rather with our own duty, making
 the Constitution! Foreign Pandours, and suchlike, go pricking and
 prancing, with a swashbuckler air; with an eye too probably to
 the _Salle des Menus_,—were it not for the “grim-looking
 countenances” that crowd all avenues there.[177] Be firm, ye
 National Senators; the cynosure of a firm, grim-looking people! The august National Senators determine that there shall, at
 least, be Permanent Session till this thing end. Wherein,
 however, consider that worthy Lafranc de Pompignan, our new
 President, whom we have named Bailly’s successor, is an old man,
 wearied with many things. He is the Brother of that Pompignan who
 meditated lamentably on the Book of _Lamentations:_     Saves-voux pourquoi Jérémie
     Se lamentait toute sa vie?
     C’est qu’il prévoyait
     Que Pompignan le traduirait!
 Poor Bishop Pompignan withdraws; having got Lafayette for helper
 or substitute: this latter, as nocturnal Vice-President, with a
 thin house in disconsolate humour, sits sleepless, with lights
 unsnuffed;—waiting what the hours will bring.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' So at Versailles. But at Paris, agitated Besenval, before
 retiring for the night, has stept over to old M. de Sombreuil, of
 the _Hôtel des Invalides_ hard by. M. de Sombreuil has, what is a
 great secret, some eight-and-twenty thousand stand of muskets
 deposited in his cellars there; but no trust in the temper of his
 Invalides. This day, for example, he sent twenty of the fellows
 down to unscrew those muskets; lest Sedition might snatch at
 them; but scarcely, in six hours, had the twenty unscrewed twenty
 gun-locks, or dogsheads (_chiens_) of locks,—each Invalide his
 dogshead! If ordered to fire, they would, he imagines, turn their
 cannon against himself. Unfortunate old military gentlemen, it is your hour, not of
 glory! Old Marquis de Launay too, of the Bastille, has pulled up
 his drawbridges long since, “and retired into his interior;” with
 sentries walking on his battlements, under the midnight sky,
 aloft over the glare of illuminated Paris;—whom a National
 Patrol, passing that way, takes the liberty of firing at; “seven
 shots towards twelve at night,” which do not take effect.[178]
 This was the 13th day of July, 1789; a worse day, many said, than
 the last 13th was, when only hail fell out of Heaven, not madness
 rose out of Tophet, ruining worse than crops! In these same days, as Chronology will teach us, hot old Marquis
 Mirabeau lies stricken down, at Argenteuil,—_not_ within sound of
 these alarm-guns; for _he_ properly is not there, and only the
 body of him now lies, deaf and cold forever. It was on Saturday
 night that he, drawing his last life-breaths, gave up the ghost
 there;—leaving a world, which would never go to his mind, now
 broken out, seemingly, into deliration and the _culbute
 générale_. What is it to him, departing elsewhither, on his long
 journey? The old Château Mirabeau stands silent, far off, on its
 scarped rock, in that “gorge of two windy valleys;” the
 pale-fading spectre now of a Château: this huge World-riot, and
 France, and the World itself, fades also, like a shadow on the
 great still mirror-sea; and all shall be as God wills. Young Mirabeau, sad of heart, for he loved this crabbed brave old
 Father, sad of heart, and occupied with sad cares,—is withdrawn
 from Public History. The great crisis transacts itself without
 him.[179]
 Chapter 1.5.VI.
 Storm and Victory. But, to the living and the struggling, a new, Fourteenth morning
 dawns. Under all roofs of this distracted City, is the nodus of a
 drama, not untragical, crowding towards solution. The bustlings
 and preparings, the tremors and menaces; the tears that fell from
 old eyes! This day, my sons, ye shall quit you like men. By the
 memory of your fathers’ wrongs, by the hope of your children’s
 rights! Tyranny impends in red wrath: help for you is none if not
 in your own right hands. This day ye must do or die. From earliest light, a sleepless Permanent Committee has heard
 the old cry, now waxing almost frantic, mutinous: Arms! Arms!
 Provost Flesselles, or what traitors there are among you, may
 think of those Charleville Boxes. A hundred-and-fifty thousand of
 us; and but the third man furnished with so much as a pike! Arms
 are the one thing needful: with arms we are an unconquerable
 man-defying National Guard; without arms, a rabble to be whiffed
 with grapeshot. Happily the word has arisen, for no secret can be kept,—that
 there lie muskets at the _Hôtel des Invalides_. Thither will we:
 King’s Procureur M. Ethys de Corny, and whatsoever of authority a
 Permanent Committee can lend, shall go with us. Besenval’s Camp
 is there; perhaps he will not fire on us; if he kill us we shall
 but die. Alas, poor Besenval, with his troops melting away in that manner,
 has not the smallest humour to fire! At five o’clock this
 morning, as he lay dreaming, oblivious in the _Ecole Militaire_,
 a “figure” stood suddenly at his bedside: “with face rather
 handsome; eyes inflamed, speech rapid and curt, air audacious:”
 such a figure drew Priam’s curtains! The message and monition of
 the figure was, that resistance would be hopeless; that if blood
 flowed, wo to him who shed it. Thus spoke the figure; and
 vanished. “Withal there was a kind of eloquence that struck one.”
 Besenval admits that he should have arrested him, but did
 not.[180] Who this figure, with inflamed eyes, with speech rapid
 and curt, might be? Besenval knows but mentions not. Camille
 Desmoulins? Pythagorean Marquis Valadi, inflamed with “violent
 motions all night at the Palais Royal?” Fame names him, “Young M.
 Meillar”;[181] Then shuts her lips about him for ever. In any case, behold about nine in the morning, our National
 Volunteers rolling in long wide flood, south-westward to the
 _Hôtel des Invalides;_ in search of the one thing needful. King’s
 procureur M. Ethys de Corny and officials are there; the Curé of
 Saint-Etienne du Mont marches unpacific, at the head of his
 militant Parish; the Clerks of the Bazoche in red coats we see
 marching, now Volunteers of the Bazoche; the Volunteers of the
 Palais Royal:—National Volunteers, numerable by tens of
 thousands; of one heart and mind. The King’s muskets are the
 Nation’s; think, old M. de Sombreuil, how, in this extremity,
 thou wilt refuse them! Old M. de Sombreuil would fain hold
 parley, send Couriers; but it skills not: the walls are scaled,
 no Invalide firing a shot; the gates must be flung open.
 Patriotism rushes in, tumultuous, from grundsel up to ridge-tile,
 through all rooms and passages; rummaging distractedly for arms.
 What cellar, or what cranny can escape it? The arms are found;
 all safe there; lying packed in straw,—apparently with a view to
 being burnt! More ravenous than famishing lions over dead prey,
 the multitude, with clangour and vociferation, pounces on them;
 struggling, dashing, clutching:—to the jamming-up, to the
 pressure, fracture and probable extinction, of the weaker
 Patriot.[182] And so, with such protracted crash of deafening,
 most discordant Orchestra-music, the Scene is changed: and
 eight-and-twenty thousand sufficient firelocks are on the
 shoulders of so many National Guards, lifted thereby out of
 darkness into fiery light. Let Besenval look at the glitter of these muskets, as they flash
 by! Gardes Françaises, it is said, have cannon levelled on him;
 ready to open, if need were, from the other side of the
 River.[183] Motionless sits he; “astonished,” one may flatter
 oneself, “at the proud bearing (_fière contenance_) of the
 Parisians.”—And now, to the Bastille, ye intrepid Parisians!
 There grapeshot still threatens; thither all men’s thoughts and
 steps are now tending. Old de Launay, as we hinted, withdrew “into his interior” soon
 after midnight of Sunday. He remains there ever since, hampered,
 as all military gentlemen now are, in the saddest conflict of
 uncertainties. The Hôtel-de-Ville “invites” him to admit National
 Soldiers, which is a soft name for surrendering. On the other
 hand, His Majesty’s orders were precise. His garrison is but
 eighty-two old Invalides, reinforced by thirty-two young Swiss;
 his walls indeed are nine feet thick, he has cannon and powder;
 but, alas, only one day’s provision of victuals. The city too is
 French, the poor garrison mostly French. Rigorous old de Launay,
 think what thou wilt do! All morning, since nine, there has been a cry everywhere: To the
 Bastille! Repeated “deputations of citizens” have been here,
 passionate for arms; whom de Launay has got dismissed by soft
 speeches through portholes. Towards noon, Elector Thuriot de la
 Rosiere gains admittance; finds de Launay indisposed for
 surrender; nay disposed for blowing up the place rather. Thuriot
 mounts with him to the battlements: heaps of paving-stones, old
 iron and missiles lie piled; cannon all duly levelled; in every
 embrasure a cannon,—only drawn back a little! But outwards
 behold, O Thuriot, how the multitude flows on, welling through
 every street; tocsin furiously pealing, all drums beating the
 _générale:_ the Suburb Saint-Antoine rolling hitherward wholly,
 as one man! Such vision (spectral yet real) thou, O Thuriot, as
 from thy Mount of Vision, beholdest in this moment: prophetic of
 what other Phantasmagories, and loud-gibbering Spectral
 Realities, which, thou yet beholdest not, but shalt! ‘_Que voulez
 vous?_’ said de Launay, turning pale at the sight, with an air of
 reproach, almost of menace. ‘Monsieur,’ said Thuriot, rising into
 the moral-sublime, ‘What mean _you?_ Consider if I could not
 precipitate _both_ of us from this height,’—say only a hundred
 feet, exclusive of the walled ditch! Whereupon de Launay fell
 silent. Thuriot shews himself from some pinnacle, to comfort the
 multitude becoming suspicious, fremescent: then descends; departs
 with protest; with warning addressed also to the Invalides,—on
 whom, however, it produces but a mixed indistinct impression. The
 old heads are none of the clearest; besides, it is said, de
 Launay has been profuse of beverages (_prodigua des buissons_).
 They think, they will not fire,—if not fired on, if they can help
 it; but must, on the whole, be ruled considerably by
 circumstances. Wo to thee, de Launay, in such an hour, if thou canst not, taking
 some one firm decision, _rule_ circumstances! Soft speeches will
 not serve; hard grape-shot is questionable; but hovering between
 the two is _un_questionable. Ever wilder swells the tide of men;
 their infinite hum waxing ever louder, into imprecations, perhaps
 into crackle of stray musketry,—which latter, on walls nine feet
 thick, cannot do execution. The Outer Drawbridge has been lowered
 for Thuriot; new _deputation of citizens_ (it is the third, and
 noisiest of all) penetrates that way into the Outer Court: soft
 speeches producing no clearance of these, de Launay gives fire;
 pulls up his Drawbridge. A slight sputter;—which has _kindled_
 the too combustible chaos; made it a roaring fire-chaos! Bursts
 forth insurrection, at sight of its own blood (for there were
 deaths by that sputter of fire), into endless rolling explosion
 of musketry, distraction, execration;—and overhead, from the
 Fortress, let one great gun, with its grape-shot, go booming, to
 shew what we _could_ do. The Bastille is besieged! On, then, all Frenchmen that have hearts in their bodies! Roar
 with all your throats, of cartilage and metal, ye Sons of
 Liberty; stir spasmodically whatsoever of utmost faculty is in
 you, soul, body or spirit; for it is the hour! Smite, thou Louis
 Tournay, cartwright of the Marais, old-soldier of the Regiment
 Dauphine; smite at that Outer Drawbridge chain, though the fiery
 hail whistles round thee! Never, over nave or felloe, did thy axe
 strike such a stroke. Down with it, man; down with it to Orcus:
 let the whole accursed Edifice sink thither, and Tyranny be
 swallowed up for ever! Mounted, some say on the roof of the
 guard-room, some “on bayonets stuck into joints of the wall,”
 Louis Tournay smites, brave Aubin Bonnemere (also an old soldier)
 seconding him: the chain yields, breaks; the huge Drawbridge
 slams down, thundering (_avec fracas_). Glorious: and yet, alas,
 it is still but the outworks. The Eight grim Towers, with their
 Invalides’ musketry, their paving stones and cannon-mouths, still
 soar aloft intact;—Ditch yawning impassable, stone-faced; the
 inner Drawbridge with its _back_ towards us: the Bastille is
 still to take! To describe this Siege of the Bastille (thought to be one of the
 most important in history) perhaps transcends the talent of
 mortals. Could one but, after infinite reading, get to understand
 so much as the plan of the building! But there is open Esplanade,
 at the end of the Rue Saint-Antoine; there are such Forecourts,
 _Cour Avancé, Cour de l’Orme_, arched Gateway (where Louis
 Tournay now fights); then new drawbridges, dormant-bridges,
 rampart-bastions, and the grim Eight Towers: a labyrinthic Mass,
 high-frowning there, of all ages from twenty years to four
 hundred and twenty;—beleaguered, in this its last hour, as we
 said, by mere Chaos come again! Ordnance of all calibres; throats
 of all capacities; men of all plans, every man his own engineer:
 seldom since the war of Pygmies and Cranes was there seen so
 anomalous a thing. Half-pay Elie is home for a suit of
 regimentals; no one would heed him in coloured clothes: half-pay
 Hulin is haranguing Gardes Françaises in the Place de Grève.
 Frantic Patriots pick up the grape-shots; bear them, still hot
 (or seemingly so), to the Hôtel-de-Ville:—Paris, you perceive, is
 to be burnt! Flesselles is “pale to the very lips” for the roar
 of the multitude grows deep. Paris wholly has got to the acme of
 its frenzy; whirled, all ways, by panic madness. At every
 street-barricade, there whirls simmering, a minor
 whirlpool,—strengthening the barricade, since God knows what is
 coming; and all minor whirlpools play distractedly into that
 grand Fire-Mahlstrom which is lashing round the Bastille. And so it lashes and it roars. Cholat the wine-merchant has
 become an impromptu cannoneer. See Georget, of the Marine
 Service, fresh from Brest, ply the King of Siam’s cannon.
 Singular (if we were not used to the like): Georget lay, last
 night, taking his ease at his inn; the King of Siam’s cannon also
 lay, knowing nothing of _him_, for a hundred years. Yet now, at
 the right instant, they have got together, and discourse eloquent
 music. For, hearing what was toward, Georget sprang from the
 Brest Diligence, and ran. Gardes Françaises also will be here,
 with real artillery: were not the walls so thick!—Upwards from
 the Esplanade, horizontally from all neighbouring roofs and
 windows, flashes one irregular deluge of musketry,—without
 effect. The Invalides lie flat, firing comparatively at their
 ease from behind stone; hardly through portholes, shew the tip of
 a nose. We fall, shot; and make no impression! Let conflagration rage; of whatsoever is combustible! Guard-rooms
 are burnt, Invalides mess-rooms. A distracted “Peruke-maker with
 two fiery torches” is for burning “the saltpetres of the
 Arsenal;”—had not a woman run screaming; had not a Patriot, with
 some tincture of Natural Philosophy, instantly struck the wind
 out of him (butt of musket on pit of stomach), overturned
 barrels, and stayed the devouring element. A young beautiful
 lady, seized escaping in these Outer Courts, and thought falsely
 to be de Launay’s daughter, shall be burnt in de Launay’s sight;
 she lies swooned on a paillasse: but again a Patriot, it is brave
 Aubin Bonnemere the old soldier, dashes in, and rescues her.
 Straw is burnt; three cartloads of it, hauled thither, go up in
 white smoke: almost to the choking of Patriotism itself; so that
 Elie had, with singed brows, to drag back one cart; and Reole the
 “gigantic haberdasher” another. Smoke as of Tophet; confusion as
 of Babel; noise as of the Crack of Doom! Blood flows, the aliment of new madness. The wounded are carried
 into houses of the Rue Cerisaie; the dying leave their last
 mandate not to yield till the accursed Stronghold fall. And yet,
 alas, how fall? The walls are so thick! Deputations, three in
 number, arrive from the Hôtel-de-Ville; Abbé Fouchet (who was of
 one) can say, with what almost superhuman courage of
 benevolence.[184] These wave their Town-flag in the arched
 Gateway; and stand, rolling their drum; but to no purpose. In
 such Crack of Doom, de Launay cannot hear them, dare not believe
 them: they return, with justified rage, the whew of lead still
 singing in their ears. What to do? The Firemen are here,
 squirting with their fire-pumps on the Invalides’ cannon, to wet
 the touchholes; they unfortunately cannot squirt so high; but
 produce only clouds of spray. Individuals of classical knowledge
 propose _catapults_. Santerre, the sonorous Brewer of the Suburb
 Saint-Antoine, advises rather that the place be fired, by a
 “mixture of phosphorous and oil-of-turpentine spouted up through
 forcing pumps:” O Spinola-Santerre, hast thou the mixture
 _ready?_ Every man his own engineer! And still the fire-deluge
 abates not; even women are firing, and Turks; at least one woman
 (with her sweetheart), and one Turk.[185] Gardes Françaises have
 come: real cannon, real cannoneers. Usher Maillard is busy;
 half-pay Elie, half-pay Hulin rage in the midst of thousands. How the great Bastille Clock ticks (inaudible) in its Inner Court
 there, at its ease, hour after hour; as if nothing special, for
 it or the world, were passing! It tolled One when the firing
 began; and is now pointing towards Five, and still the firing
 slakes not.—Far down, in their vaults, the seven Prisoners hear
 muffled din as of earthquakes; their Turnkeys answer vaguely. Wo to thee, de Launay, with thy poor hundred Invalides! Broglie
 is distant, and his ears heavy: Besenval hears, but can send no
 help. One poor troop of Hussars has crept, reconnoitring,
 cautiously along the Quais, as far as the Pont Neuf. ‘We are come
 to join you,’ said the Captain; for the crowd seems shoreless. A
 large-headed dwarfish individual, of smoke-bleared aspect,
 shambles forward, opening his blue lips, for there is sense in
 him; and croaks: ‘Alight then, and give up your arms!’ the
 Hussar-Captain is too happy to be escorted to the Barriers, and
 dismissed on parole. Who the squat individual was? Men answer, it
 is M. Marat, author of the excellent pacific _Avis au Peuple!_
 Great truly, O thou remarkable Dogleech, is this thy day of
 emergence and new birth: and yet this same day come four
 years—!—But let the curtains of the future hang. What shall de Launay do? One thing only de Launay could have
 done: what he said he would do. Fancy him sitting, from the
 first, with lighted taper, within arm’s length of the
 Powder-Magazine; motionless, like old Roman Senator, or bronze
 Lamp-holder; coldly apprising Thuriot, and all men, by a slight
 motion of his eye, what his resolution was:—Harmless he sat
 there, while unharmed; but the King’s Fortress, meanwhile, could,
 might, would, or should, in nowise, be surrendered, save to the
 King’s Messenger: one old man’s life worthless, so it be lost
 with honour; but think, ye brawling _canaille_, how will it be
 when a whole Bastille springs skyward!—In such statuesque,
 taper-holding attitude, one fancies de Launay might have left
 Thuriot, the red Clerks of the Bazoche, Curé of Saint-Stephen and
 all the tagrag-and-bobtail of the world, to work their will. And yet, withal, he could not do it. Hast thou considered how
 each man’s heart is so tremulously responsive to the hearts of
 all men; hast thou noted how omnipotent is the very sound of many
 men? How their shriek of indignation palsies the strong soul;
 their howl of contumely withers with unfelt pangs? The Ritter
 Gluck confessed that the ground-tone of the noblest passage, in
 one of his noblest Operas, was the voice of the Populace he had
 heard at Vienna, crying to their Kaiser: Bread! Bread! Great is
 the combined voice of men; the utterance of their _instincts_,
 which are truer than their _thoughts:_ it is the greatest a man
 encounters, among the sounds and shadows, which make up this
 World of Time. He who can resist that, has his footing some where
 _beyond_ Time. De Launay could not do it. Distracted, he hovers
 between the two; hopes in the middle of despair; surrenders not
 his Fortress; declares that he will blow it up, seizes torches to
 blow it up, and does not blow it. Unhappy old de Launay, it is
 the death-agony of thy Bastille and thee! Jail, Jailoring and
 Jailor, all three, such as they may have been, must finish. For four hours now has the World-Bedlam roared: call it the
 World-Chimaera, blowing fire! The poor Invalides have sunk under
 their battlements, or rise only with reversed muskets: they have
 made a white flag of napkins; go beating the _chamade_, or
 seeming to beat, for one can hear nothing. The very Swiss at the
 Portcullis look weary of firing; disheartened in the fire-deluge:
 a porthole at the drawbridge is opened, as by one that would
 speak. See Huissier Maillard, the shifty man! On his plank,
 swinging over the abyss of that stone-Ditch; plank resting on
 parapet, balanced by weight of Patriots,—he hovers perilous: such
 a Dove towards such an Ark! Deftly, thou shifty Usher: one man
 already fell; and lies smashed, far down there, against the
 masonry! Usher Maillard falls not: deftly, unerring he walks,
 with outspread palm. The Swiss holds a paper through his
 porthole; the shifty Usher snatches it, and returns. Terms of
 surrender: Pardon, immunity to all! Are they accepted?—‘_Foi
 d’officier_, On the word of an officer,’ answers half-pay
 Hulin,—or half-pay Elie, for men do not agree on it, ‘they are!’
 Sinks the drawbridge,—Usher Maillard bolting it when down;
 rushes-in the living deluge: the Bastille is fallen! _Victoire!
 La Bastille est prise!_[186]
 Chapter 1.5.VII.
 Not a Revolt. Why dwell on what follows? Hulin’s _foi d’officier_ should have
 been kept, but could not. The Swiss stand drawn up; disguised in
 white canvas smocks; the Invalides without disguise; their arms
 all piled against the wall. The first rush of victors, in ecstacy
 that the death-peril is passed, “leaps joyfully on their necks;”
 but new victors rush, and ever new, also in ecstacy not wholly of
 joy. As we said, it was a living deluge, plunging headlong; had
 not the Gardes Françaises, in their cool military way, “wheeled
 round with arms levelled,” it would have plunged suicidally, by
 the hundred or the thousand, into the Bastille-ditch. And so it goes plunging through court and corridor; billowing
 uncontrollable, firing from windows—on itself: in hot frenzy of
 triumph, of grief and vengeance for its slain. The poor Invalides
 will fare ill; one Swiss, running off in his white smock, is
 driven back, with a death-thrust. Let all prisoners be marched to
 the Townhall, to be judged!—Alas, already one poor Invalide has
 his right hand slashed off him; his maimed body dragged to the
 Place de Grève, and hanged there. This same right hand, it is
 said, turned back de Launay from the Powder-Magazine, and saved
 Paris. De Launay, “discovered in gray frock with poppy-coloured riband,”
 is for killing himself with the sword of his cane. He shall to
 the Hôtel-de-Ville; Hulin Maillard and others escorting him; Elie
 marching foremost “with the capitulation-paper on his sword’s
 point.” Through roarings and cursings; through hustlings,
 clutchings, and at last through strokes! Your escort is hustled
 aside, felled down; Hulin sinks exhausted on a heap of stones.
 Miserable de Launay! He shall never enter the Hotel de Ville:
 only his “bloody hair-queue, held up in a bloody hand;” that
 shall enter, for a sign. The bleeding trunk lies on the steps
 there; the head is off through the streets; ghastly, aloft on a
 pike. Rigorous de Launay has died; crying out, ‘O friends, kill me
 fast!’ Merciful de Losme must die; though Gratitude embraces him,
 in this fearful hour, and will die for him; it avails not.
 Brothers, your wrath is cruel! Your Place de Grève is become a
 Throat of the Tiger; full of mere fierce bellowings, and thirst
 of blood. One other officer is massacred; one other Invalide is
 hanged on the Lamp-iron: with difficulty, with generous
 perseverance, the Gardes Françaises will save the rest. Provost
 Flesselles stricken long since with the paleness of death, must
 descend from his seat, “to be judged at the Palais Royal:”—alas,
 to be shot dead, by an unknown hand, at the turning of the first
 street!— O evening sun of July, how, at this hour, thy beams fall slant on
 reapers amid peaceful woody fields; on old women spinning in
 cottages; on ships far out in the silent main; on Balls at the
 Orangerie of Versailles, where high-rouged Dames of the Palace
 are even now dancing with double-jacketted Hussar-Officers;—and
 also on this roaring Hell porch of a Hôtel-de-Ville! Babel Tower,
 with the confusion of tongues, were not Bedlam added with the
 conflagration of thoughts, was no type of it. One forest of
 distracted steel bristles, endless, in front of an Electoral
 Committee; points itself, in horrid radii, against this and the
 other accused breast. It was the Titans warring with Olympus; and
 they scarcely crediting it, have _conquered:_ prodigy of
 prodigies; delirious,—as it could not but be. Denunciation,
 vengeance; blaze of triumph on a dark ground of terror: all
 outward, all inward things fallen into one general wreck of
 madness! Electoral Committee? Had it a thousand throats of brass, it would
 not suffice. Abbé Lefevre, in the Vaults down below, is black as
 Vulcan, distributing that “five thousand weight of Powder;” with
 what perils, these eight-and-forty hours! Last night, a Patriot,
 in liquor, insisted on sitting to smoke on the edge of one of the
 Powder-barrels; there smoked he, independent of the world,—till
 the Abbé “purchased his pipe for three francs,” and pitched it
 far. Elie, in the grand Hall, Electoral Committee looking on, sits
 “with drawn sword bent in three places;” with battered helm, for
 he was of the Queen’s Regiment, Cavalry; with torn regimentals,
 face singed and soiled; comparable, some think, to “an antique
 warrior;”—judging the people; forming a list of Bastille Heroes.
 O Friends, stain not with blood the greenest laurels ever gained
 in this world: such is the burden of Elie’s song; could it but be
 listened to. Courage, Elie! Courage, ye Municipal Electors! A
 declining sun; the need of victuals, and of telling news, will
 bring assuagement, dispersion: all earthly things must end. Along the streets of Paris circulate Seven Bastille Prisoners,
 borne shoulder-high: seven Heads on pikes; the Keys of the
 Bastille; and much else. See also the Garde Françaises, in their
 steadfast military way, marching home to their barracks, with the
 Invalides and Swiss kindly enclosed in hollow square. It is one
 year and two months since these same men stood unparticipating,
 with Brennus d’Agoust at the Palais de Justice, when Fate
 overtook d’Espréménil; and now they have participated; and will
 participate. Not Gardes Françaises henceforth, but _Centre
 Grenadiers of the National Guard:_ men of iron discipline and
 humour,—not without a kind of thought in them! Likewise ashlar stones of the Bastille continue thundering
 through the dusk; its paper-archives shall fly white. Old secrets
 come to view; and long-buried Despair finds voice. Read this
 portion of an old Letter:[187] “If for my consolation Monseigneur
 would grant me for the sake of God and the Most Blessed Trinity,
 that I could have news of my dear wife; were it only her name on
 card to shew that she is alive! It were the greatest consolation
 I could receive; and I should for ever bless the greatness of
 Monseigneur.” Poor Prisoner, who namest thyself _Quéret Démery_,
 and hast no other history,—she is _dead_, that dear wife of
 thine, and thou art dead! ’Tis fifty years since thy breaking
 heart put this question; to be heard now first, and long heard,
 in the hearts of men. But so does the July twilight thicken; so must Paris, as sick
 children, and all distracted creatures do, brawl itself finally
 into a kind of sleep. Municipal Electors, astonished to find
 their heads still uppermost, are home: only Moreau de Saint-Méry
 of tropical birth and heart, of coolest judgment; he, with two
 others, shall sit permanent at the Townhall. Paris sleeps; gleams
 upward the illuminated City: patrols go clashing, without common
 watchword; there go rumours; alarms of war, to the extent of
 “fifteen thousand men marching through the Suburb
 Saint-Antoine,”—who never got it marched through. Of the day’s
 distraction judge by this of the night: Moreau de Saint-Méry,
 “before rising from his seat, gave upwards of three thousand
 orders.”[188] What a head; comparable to Friar Bacon’s Brass
 Head! Within it lies all Paris. Prompt must the answer be, right
 or wrong; in Paris is no other Authority extant. Seriously, a
 most cool clear head;—for which also thou O brave Saint-Méry, in
 many capacities, from august Senator to Merchant’s-Clerk,
 Book-dealer, Vice-King; in many places, from Virginia to
 Sardinia, shalt, ever as a brave man, find employment.[189] Besenval has decamped, under cloud of dusk, “amid a great
 affluence of people,” who did not harm him; he marches, with
 faint-growing tread, down the left bank of the Seine, all
 night,—towards infinite space. Resummoned shall Besenval himself
 be; for trial, for difficult acquittal. His King’s-troops, his
 Royal Allemand, are gone hence for ever. The Versailles Ball and lemonade is done; the Orangery is silent
 except for nightbirds. Over in the Salle des Menus,
 Vice-president Lafayette, with unsnuffed lights, “with some
 hundred of members, stretched on tables round him,” sits erect;
 outwatching the Bear. This day, a second solemn Deputation went
 to his Majesty; a second, and then a third: with no effect. What
 will the end of these things be? In the Court, all is mystery, not without whisperings of terror;
 though ye dream of lemonade and epaulettes, ye foolish women! His
 Majesty, kept in happy ignorance, perhaps dreams of
 double-barrels and the Woods of Meudon. Late at night, the Duke
 de Liancourt, having official right of entrance, gains access to
 the Royal Apartments; unfolds, with earnest clearness, in his
 constitutional way, the Job’s-news. ‘_Mais_,’ said poor Louis,
 ‘_c’est une révolte_, Why, that is a revolt!’—‘Sire,’ answered
 Liancourt, ‘It is not a revolt, it is a revolution.’

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' On the morrow a fourth Deputation to the Château is on foot: of a
 more solemn, not to say awful character, for, besides “orgies in
 the Orangery,” it seems, “the grain convoys are all stopped;” nor
 has Mirabeau’s thunder been silent. Such Deputation is on the
 point of setting out—when lo, his Majesty himself attended only
 by his two Brothers, step in; quite in the paternal manner;
 announces that the troops, and all causes of offence, are gone,
 and henceforth there shall be nothing but trust, reconcilement,
 good-will; whereof he “permits and even requests,” a National
 Assembly to assure Paris in his name! Acclamation, as of men
 suddenly delivered from death, gives answer. The whole Assembly
 spontaneously rises to escort his Majesty back; “interlacing
 their arms to keep off the excessive pressure from him;” for all
 Versailles is crowding and shouting. The Château Musicians, with
 a felicitous promptitude, strike up the _Sein de sa Famille_
 (Bosom of one’s Family): the Queen appears at the balcony with
 her little boy and girl, “kissing them several times;” infinite
 _Vivats_ spread far and wide;—and suddenly there has come, as it
 were, a new Heaven-on-Earth. Eighty-eight august Senators, Bailly, Lafayette, and our
 repentant Archbishop among them, take coach for Paris, with the
 great intelligence; benedictions without end on their heads. From
 the Place Louis Quinze, where they alight, all the way to the
 Hôtel-de-Ville, it is one sea of Tricolor cockades, of clear
 National muskets; one tempest of huzzaings, hand-clappings, aided
 by “occasional rollings” of drum-music. Harangues of due fervour
 are delivered; especially by Lally Tollendal, pious son of the
 ill-fated murdered Lally; on whose head, in consequence, a civic
 crown (of oak or parsley) is forced,—which he forcibly transfers
 to Bailly’s. But surely, for one thing, the National Guard must have a
 General! Moreau de Saint-Méry, he of the “three thousand orders,”
 casts one of his significant glances on the Bust of Lafayette,
 which has stood there ever since the American War of Liberty.
 Whereupon, by acclamation, Lafayette is nominated. Again, in room
 of the slain traitor or quasi-traitor Flesselles, President
 Bailly shall be—Provost of the Merchants? No: Mayor of Paris! So
 be it. _Maire de Paris!_ Mayor Bailly, General Lafayette; _vive
 Bailly, vive Lafayette_—the universal out-of-doors multitude
 rends the welkin in confirmation.—And now, finally, let us to
 Notre-Dame for a _Te Deum._ Towards Notre-Dame Cathedral, in glad procession, these
 Regenerators of the Country walk, through a jubilant people; in
 fraternal manner; Abbé Lefevre, still black with his gunpowder
 services, walking arm in arm with the white-stoled Archbishop.
 Poor Bailly comes upon the Foundling Children, sent to kneel to
 him; and “weeps.” _Te Deum_, our Archbishop officiating, is not
 only sung, but _shot_—with blank cartridges. Our joy is boundless
 as our wo threatened to be. Paris, by her own pike and musket,
 and the valour of her own heart, has conquered the very
 wargods,—to the satisfaction now of Majesty itself. A courier is,
 this night, getting under way for Necker: the People’s Minister,
 invited back by King, by National Assembly, and Nation, shall
 traverse France amid shoutings, and the sound of trumpet and
 timbrel. Seeing which course of things, Messeigneurs of the Court
 Triumvirate, Messieurs of the dead-born Broglie-Ministry, and
 others such, consider that their part also is clear: to mount and
 ride. Off, ye too-loyal Broglies, Polignacs, and Princes of the
 Blood; off while it is yet time! Did not the Palais-Royal in its
 late nocturnal “violent motions,” set a specific price (place of
 payment not mentioned) on each of your heads?—With precautions,
 with the aid of pieces of cannon and regiments that can be
 depended on, Messeigneurs, between the 16th night and the 17th
 morning, get to their several roads. Not without risk! Prince
 Condé has (or seems to have) “men galloping at full speed;” with
 a view, it is thought, to fling him into the river Oise, at
 Pont-Sainte-Mayence.[190] The Polignacs travel disguised;
 friends, not servants, on their coach-box. Broglie has his own
 difficulties at Versailles, runs his own risks at Metz and
 Verdun; does nevertheless get safe to Luxemburg, and there rests. This is what they call the First Emigration; determined on, as
 appears, in full Court-conclave; his Majesty assisting; prompt
 he, for his share of it, to follow any counsel whatsoever. “Three
 Sons of France, and four Princes of the blood of Saint Louis,”
 says Weber, “could not more effectually humble the Burghers of
 Paris than by appearing to withdraw in fear of their life.” Alas,
 the Burghers of Paris bear it with unexpected Stoicism! The Man
 d’Artois indeed is gone; but has he carried, for example, the
 Land D’Artois with him? Not even Bagatelle the Country-house
 (which shall be useful as a Tavern); hardly the four-valet
 Breeches, leaving the Breeches-maker!—As for old Foulon, one
 learns that he is dead; at least a “sumptuous funeral” is going
 on; the undertakers honouring him, if no other will. Intendant
 Berthier, his son-in-law, is still living; lurking: he joined
 Besenval, on that Eumenides’ Sunday; appearing to treat it with
 levity; and is now fled no man knows whither. The Emigration is not gone many miles, Prince Condé hardly across
 the Oise, when his Majesty, according to arrangement, for the
 Emigration also thought it might do good,—undertakes a rather
 daring enterprise: that of visiting Paris in person. With a
 Hundred Members of Assembly; with small or no military escort,
 which indeed he dismissed at the Bridge of Sèvres, poor Louis
 sets out; leaving a desolate Palace; a Queen weeping, the
 Present, the Past, and the Future all so unfriendly for her. At the Barrier of Passy, Mayor Bailly, in grand gala, presents
 him with the keys; harangues him, in Academic style; mentions
 that it is a great day; that in Henri Quatre’s case, the King had
 to make conquest of his People, but in this happier case, the
 People makes conquest of its King (_a conquis son Roi_). The
 King, so happily conquered, drives forward, slowly, through a
 steel people, all silent, or shouting only _Vive la Nation;_ is
 harangued at the Townhall, by Moreau of the three-thousand
 orders, by King’s Procureur M. Ethys de Corny, by Lally
 Tollendal, and others; knows not what to think of it, or say of
 it; learns that he is “Restorer of French Liberty,”—as a Statue
 of him, to be raised on the site of the Bastille, shall testify
 to all men. Finally, he is shewn at the Balcony, with a Tricolor
 cockade in his hat; is greeted now, with vehement acclamation,
 from Square and Street, from all windows and roofs:—and so drives
 home again amid glad mingled and, as it were, intermarried
 shouts, of _Vive le Roi_ and _Vive la Nation;_ wearied but safe. It was Sunday when the red-hot balls hung over us, in mid air: it
 is now but Friday, and “the Revolution is sanctioned.” An August
 National Assembly shall make the Constitution; and neither
 foreign Pandour, domestic Triumvirate, with levelled Cannon,
 Guy-Faux powder-plots (for that too was spoken of); nor any
 tyrannic Power on the Earth, or under the Earth, shall say to it,
 What dost thou?—So jubilates the people; sure now of a
 Constitution. Cracked Marquis Saint-Huruge is heard under the
 windows of the Château; murmuring sheer speculative-treason.[191]
 Chapter 1.5.IX.
 The Lanterne. The Fall of the Bastille may be said to have shaken all France to
 the deepest foundations of its existence. The rumour of these
 wonders flies every where: with the natural speed of Rumour; with
 an effect thought to be preternatural, produced by plots. Did
 d’Orléans or Laclos, nay did Mirabeau (not overburdened with
 money at this time) send riding Couriers out from Paris; to
 gallop “on all radii,” or highways, towards all points of France?
 It is a miracle, which no penetrating man will call in
 question.[192] Already in most Towns, Electoral Committees were met; to regret
 Necker, in harangue and resolution. In many a Town, as Rennes,
 Caen, Lyons, an ebullient people was already regretting him in
 brickbats and musketry. But now, at every Town’s-end in France,
 there do arrive, in these days of terror,—“men,” as men will
 arrive; nay, “men on horseback,” since Rumour oftenest travels
 riding. These men declare, with alarmed countenance, _The_
 BRIGANDS to be coming, to be just at hand; and do then—ride on,
 about their further business, be what it might! Whereupon the
 whole population of such Town, defensively flies to arms.
 Petition is soon thereafter forwarded to National Assembly; in
 such peril and terror of peril, leave to organise yourself cannot
 be withheld: the armed population becomes everywhere an enrolled
 National Guard. Thus rides Rumour, careering along all radii,
 from Paris outwards, to such purpose: in few days, some say in
 not many hours, all France to the utmost borders bristles with
 bayonets. Singular, but undeniable,—miraculous or not!—But thus
 may any chemical liquid; though cooled to the freezing-point, or
 far lower, still continue liquid; and then, on the slightest
 stroke or shake, it at once rushes wholly into ice. Thus has
 France, for long months and even years, been chemically dealt
 with; brought below zero; and now, shaken by the Fall of a
 Bastille, it instantaneously congeals: into one crystallised
 mass, of sharp-cutting steel! _Guai a chi la tocca;_ ’Ware who
 touches it! In Paris, an Electoral Committee, with a new Mayor and General,
 is urgent with belligerent workmen to resume their handicrafts.
 Strong Dames of the Market (_Dames de la Halle_) deliver
 congratulatory harangues; present “bouquets to the Shrine of
 Sainte Genevieve.” Unenrolled men deposit their arms,—not so
 readily as could be wished; and receive “nine francs.” With _Te
 Deums_, Royal Visits, and sanctioned Revolution, there is halcyon
 weather; weather even of preternatural brightness; the hurricane
 being overblown. Nevertheless, as is natural, the waves still run high, hollow
 rocks retaining their murmur. We are but at the 22nd of the
 month, hardly above a week since the Bastille fell, when it
 suddenly appears that old Foulon is alive; nay, that he is here,
 in early morning, in the streets of Paris; the extortioner, the
 plotter, who would make the people eat grass, and was a liar from
 the beginning!—It is even so. The deceptive “sumptuous funeral”
 (of some domestic that died); the hiding-place at Vitry towards
 Fontainbleau, have not availed that wretched old man. Some living
 domestic or dependant, for none loves Foulon, has betrayed him to
 the Village. Merciless boors of Vitry unearth him; pounce on him,
 like hell-hounds: Westward, old Infamy; to Paris, to be judged at
 the Hôtel-de-Ville! His old head, which seventy-four years have
 bleached, is bare; they have tied an emblematic bundle of grass
 on his back; a garland of nettles and thistles is round his neck:
 in this manner; led with ropes; goaded on with curses and
 menaces, must he, with his old limbs, sprawl forward; the
 pitiablest, most unpitied of all old men. Sooty Saint-Antoine, and every street, mustering its crowds as he
 passes,—the Place de Grève, the Hall of the Hôtel-de-Ville will
 scarcely hold his escort and him. Foulon must not only be judged
 righteously; but judged there where he stands, without any delay.
 Appoint seven judges, ye Municipals, or seventy-and-seven; name
 them yourselves, or we will name them: but judge him![193]
 Electoral rhetoric, eloquence of Mayor Bailly, is wasted
 explaining the beauty of the Law’s delay. Delay, and still delay!
 Behold, O Mayor of the People, the morning has worn itself into
 noon; and he is still unjudged!—Lafayette, pressingly sent for,
 arrives; gives voice: This Foulon, a known man, is guilty almost
 beyond doubt; but may he not have accomplices? Ought not the
 truth to be cunningly pumped out of him,—in the Abbaye Prison? It
 is a new light! Sansculottism claps hands;—at which
 hand-clapping, Foulon (in his fainness, as his Destiny would have
 it) also claps. ‘See! they understand one another!’ cries dark
 Sansculottism, blazing into fury of suspicion.—‘Friends,’ said “a
 person in good clothes,” stepping forward, ‘what is the use of
 judging this man? Has he not been judged these thirty years?’
 With wild yells, Sansculottism clutches him, in its hundred
 hands: he is whirled across the Place de Grève, to the
 “_Lanterne_,” Lamp-iron which there is at the corner of the _Rue
 de la Vannerie;_ pleading bitterly for life,—to the deaf winds.
 Only with the third rope (for two ropes broke, and the quavering
 voice still pleaded), can he be so much as got hanged! His Body
 is dragged through the streets; his Head goes aloft on a pike,
 the mouth filled with grass: amid sounds as of Tophet, from a
 grass-eating people.[194] Surely if Revenge is a “kind of Justice,” it is a “wild” kind! O
 mad Sansculottism hast thou risen, in thy mad darkness, in thy
 soot and rags; unexpectedly, like an Enceladus, living-buried,
 from under his Trinacria? They that would make grass be eaten do
 now eat grass, in _this_ manner? After long dumb-groaning
 generations, has the turn suddenly become thine?—To such abysmal
 overturns, and frightful instantaneous inversions of the
 centre-of-gravity, are human Solecisms all liable, if they but
 knew it; the more liable, the falser (and topheavier) they are!— To add to the horror of Mayor Bailly and his Municipals, word
 comes that Berthier has also been arrested; that he is on his way
 hither from Compiègne. Berthier, Intendant (say, _Tax-levier_) of
 Paris; sycophant and tyrant; forestaller of Corn; contriver of
 Camps against the people;—accused of many things: is he not
 Foulon’s son-in-law; and, in that one point, guilty of all? In
 these hours too, when Sansculottism has its blood up! The
 shuddering Municipals send one of their number to escort him,
 with mounted National Guards. At the fall of day, the wretched Berthier, still wearing a face
 of courage, arrives at the Barrier; in an open carriage; with the
 Municipal beside him; five hundred horsemen with drawn sabres;
 unarmed footmen enough, not without noise! Placards go brandished
 round him; bearing legibly his indictment, as Sansculottism, with
 unlegal brevity, “in huge letters,” draws it up.[195] Paris is
 come forth to meet him: with hand-clappings, with windows flung
 up; with dances, triumph-songs, as of the Furies! Lastly the Head
 of Foulon: this also meets him on a pike. Well might his “look
 become glazed,” and sense fail him, at such sight!—Nevertheless,
 be the man’s conscience what it may, his nerves are of iron. At
 the Hôtel-de-Ville, he will answer nothing. He says, he obeyed
 superior order; they have his papers; they may judge and
 determine: as for himself, not having closed an eye these two
 nights, he demands, before all things, to have sleep. Leaden
 sleep, thou miserable Berthier! Guards rise with him, in motion
 towards the Abbaye. At the very door of the Hôtel-de-Ville, they
 are clutched; flung asunder, as by a vortex of mad arms; Berthier
 whirls towards the Lanterne. He snatches a musket; fells and
 strikes, defending himself like a mad lion; is borne down,
 trampled, hanged, mangled: his Head too, and even his Heart,
 flies over the City on a pike. Horrible, in Lands that had known equal justice! Not so unnatural
 in Lands that had never known it. _Le sang qui coule est-il donc
 si pure?_ asks Barnave; intimating that the Gallows, though by
 irregular methods, has its own.—Thou thyself, O Reader, when thou
 turnest that corner of the Rue de la Vannerie, and discernest
 still that same grim Bracket of old Iron, wilt not want for
 reflections. “Over a grocer’s shop,” or otherwise; with “a bust
 of Louis XIV. in the niche under it,” or now no longer in the
 niche,—_it_ still sticks there: still holding out an ineffectual
 light, of fish-oil; and has seen worlds wrecked, and says
 nothing. But to the eye of enlightened Patriotism, what a thunder-cloud
 was this; suddenly shaping itself in the radiance of the halcyon
 weather! Cloud of Erebus blackness: betokening latent electricity
 without limit. Mayor Bailly, General Lafayette throw up their
 commissions, in an indignant manner;—need to be flattered back
 again. The cloud disappears, as thunder-clouds do. The halcyon
 weather returns, though of a grayer complexion; of a character
 more and more evidently _not_ supernatural. Thus, in any case, with what rubs soever, shall the Bastille be
 abolished from our Earth; and with it, Feudalism, Despotism; and,
 one hopes, Scoundrelism generally, and all hard usage of man by
 his brother man. Alas, the Scoundrelism and hard usage are not so
 easy of abolition! But as for the Bastille, it sinks day after
 day, and month after month; its ashlars and boulders tumbling
 down continually, by express order of our Municipals. Crowds of
 the curious roam through its caverns; gaze on the skeletons found
 walled up, on the _oubliettes_, iron cages, monstrous
 stone-blocks with padlock chains. One day we discern Mirabeau
 there; along with the Genevese Dumont.[196] Workers and onlookers
 make reverent way for him; fling verses, flowers on his path,
 Bastille-papers and curiosities into his carriage, with _vivats._ Able Editors compile Books from the _Bastille Archives;_ from
 what of them remain unburnt. The Key of that Robber-Den shall
 cross the Atlantic; shall lie on Washington’s hall-table. The
 great Clock ticks now in a private patriotic Clockmaker’s
 apartment; no longer measuring hours of mere heaviness. Vanished
 is the Bastille, what we call vanished: the _body_, or
 sandstones, of it hanging, in benign metamorphosis, for centuries
 to come, over the Seine waters, as _Pont Louis Seize_;[197] the
 soul of it living, perhaps still longer, in the memories of men. So far, ye august Senators, with your Tennis-Court Oaths, your
 inertia and impetus, your sagacity and pertinacity, have ye
 brought us. ‘And yet think, Messieurs,’ as the Petitioner justly
 urged, ‘you who were our saviours, did yourselves need
 saviours,’—the brave Bastillers, namely; workmen of Paris; many
 of them in straightened pecuniary circumstances! [198]
 Subscriptions are opened; Lists are formed, more accurate than
 Elie’s; harangues are delivered. A Body of _Bastille Heroes_,
 tolerably complete, did get together;—comparable to the
 Argonauts; hoping to endure like them. But in little more than a
 year, the whirlpool of things threw them asunder again, and they
 sank. So many highest superlatives achieved by man are followed
 by new higher; and dwindle into comparatives and positives! The
 Siege of the Bastille, weighed with which, in the Historical
 balance, most other sieges, including that of Troy Town, are
 gossamer, cost, as we find, in killed and mortally wounded, on
 the part of the Besiegers, some Eighty-three persons: on the part
 of the Besieged, after all that straw-burning, fire-pumping, and
 deluge of musketry, One poor solitary invalid, shot stone-dead
 (_roide-mort_) on the battlements;[199] The Bastille Fortress,
 like the City of Jericho, was overturned by miraculous _sound._
 BOOK VI.
 CONSOLIDATION
 Chapter 1.6.I.
 Make the Constitution. Here perhaps is the place to fix, a little more precisely, what
 these two words, _French Revolution_, shall mean; for, strictly
 considered, they may have as many meanings as there are speakers
 of them. All things are in revolution; in change from moment to
 moment, which becomes sensible from epoch to epoch: in this
 Time-World of ours there is properly nothing else but revolution
 and mutation, and even nothing else conceivable. Revolution, you
 answer, means _speedier_ change. Whereupon one has still to ask:
 How speedy? At what degree of speed; in what particular points of
 this variable course, which varies in velocity, but can never
 stop till Time itself stops, does revolution begin and end; cease
 to be ordinary mutation, and again become such? It is a thing
 that will depend on definition more or less arbitrary. For ourselves we answer that French Revolution means here the
 open violent Rebellion, and Victory, of disimprisoned Anarchy
 against corrupt worn-out Authority: how Anarchy breaks prison;
 bursts up from the infinite Deep, and rages uncontrollable,
 immeasurable, enveloping a world; in phasis after phasis of
 fever-frenzy;—till the frenzy burning itself out, and what
 elements of new Order it held (since all Force holds such)
 developing themselves, the Uncontrollable be got, if not
 reimprisoned, yet harnessed, and its mad forces made to work
 towards their object as sane regulated ones. For as Hierarchies
 and Dynasties of all kinds, Theocracies, Aristocracies,
 Autocracies, Strumpetocracies, have ruled over the world; so it
 was appointed, in the decrees of Providence, that this same
 Victorious Anarchy, Jacobinism, Sansculottism, French Revolution,
 Horrors of French Revolution, or what else mortals name it,
 should have its turn. The “destructive wrath” of Sansculottism:
 this is what we speak, having unhappily no voice for singing. Surely a great Phenomenon: nay it is a _transcendental_ one,
 overstepping all rules and experience; the crowning Phenomenon of
 our Modern Time. For here again, most unexpectedly, comes antique
 Fanaticism in new and newest vesture; miraculous, as all
 Fanaticism is. Call it the Fanaticism of “making away with
 formulas, _de humer les formules_.” The world of formulas, the
 _formed_ regulated world, which all habitable world is,—must
 needs hate such Fanaticism like death; and be at deadly variance
 with it. The world of formulas must conquer it; or failing that,
 must die execrating it, anathematising it;—can nevertheless in
 nowise prevent its being and its having been. The Anathemas are
 there, and the miraculous Thing is there. Whence it cometh? Whither it goeth? These are questions! When the
 age of Miracles lay faded into the distance as an incredible
 tradition, and even the age of Conventionalities was now old; and
 Man’s Existence had for long generations rested on mere formulas
 which were grown hollow by course of time; and it seemed as if no
 Reality any longer existed but only Phantasms of realities, and
 God’s Universe were the work of the Tailor and Upholsterer
 mainly, and men were buckram masks that went about becking and
 grimacing there,—on a sudden, the Earth yawns asunder, and amid
 Tartarean smoke, and glare of fierce brightness, rises
 SANSCULOTTISM, many-headed, fire-breathing, and asks: What think
 ye of _me?_ Well may the buckram masks start together,
 terror-struck; “into expressive well-concerted groups!” It is
 indeed, Friends, a most singular, most fatal thing. Let whosoever
 is but buckram and a phantasm look to it: ill verily may it fare
 with him; here methinks he cannot much longer be. Wo also to many
 a one who is not wholly buckram, but partially real and human!
 The age of Miracles has come back! “Behold the World-Phoenix, in
 fire-consummation and fire-creation; wide are her fanning wings;
 loud is her death-melody, of battle-thunders and falling towns;
 skyward lashes the funeral flame, enveloping all things: it is
 the Death-Birth of a World!” Whereby, however, as we often say, shall one unspeakable blessing
 seem attainable. This, namely: that Man and his Life rest no more
 on hollowness and a Lie, but on solidity and some kind of Truth.
 Welcome, the beggarliest truth, so it _be_ one, in exchange for
 the royallest sham! Truth of any kind breeds ever new and better
 truth; thus hard granite rock will crumble down into soil, under
 the blessed skyey influences; and cover itself with verdure, with
 fruitage and umbrage. But as for Falsehood, which in like
 contrary manner, grows ever falser,—what can it, or what should
 it do but decease, being ripe; decompose itself, gently or even
 violently, and return to the Father of it,—too probably in flames
 of fire? Sansculottism will burn much; but what is incombustible it will
 not burn. Fear not Sansculottism; recognise it for what it is,
 the portentous, inevitable end of much, the miraculous beginning
 of much. One other thing thou mayest understand of it: that it
 too came from God; for has it not _been?_ From of old, as it is
 written, are His goings forth; in the great Deep of things;
 fearful and wonderful now as in the beginning: in the whirlwind
 also He speaks! and the wrath of men is made to praise Him.—But
 to gauge and measure this immeasurable Thing, and what is called
 _account for it_, and reduce it to a dead logic-formula, attempt
 not! Much less shalt thou shriek thyself hoarse, cursing it; for
 that, to all needful lengths, has been already done. As an
 actually existing Son of Time, _look_, with unspeakable manifold
 interest, oftenest in silence, at what the Time did bring:
 therewith edify, instruct, nourish thyself, or were it but to
 amuse and gratify thyself, as it is given thee. Another question which at every new turn will rise on us,
 requiring ever new reply is this: Where the French Revolution
 specially _is?_ In the King’s Palace, in his Majesty’s or her
 Majesty’s managements, and maltreatments, cabals, imbecilities
 and woes, answer some few:—whom we do not answer. In the National
 Assembly, answer a large mixed multitude: who accordingly seat
 themselves in the Reporter’s Chair; and therefrom noting what
 Proclamations, Acts, Reports, passages of logic-fence, bursts of
 parliamentary eloquence seem notable within doors, and what
 tumults and rumours of tumult become audible from
 without,—produce volume on volume; and, naming it History of the
 French Revolution, contentedly publish the same. To do the like,
 to almost any extent, with so many Filed Newspapers, _Choix des
 Rapports, Histoires Parlementaires_ as there are, amounting to
 many horseloads, were easy for us. Easy but unprofitable. The
 National Assembly, named now Constituent Assembly, goes its
 course; making the Constitution; but the French Revolution also
 goes _its_ course. In general, may we not say that the French Revolution lies in the
 heart and head of every violent-speaking, of every
 violent-thinking French Man? How the Twenty-five Millions of
 such, in their perplexed combination, acting and counter-acting
 may give birth to events; which event successively is the
 cardinal one; and from what point of vision it may best be
 surveyed: this is a problem. Which problem the best insight,
 seeking light from all possible sources, shifting its point of
 vision whithersoever vision or glimpse of vision can be had, may
 employ itself in solving; and be well content to solve in some
 tolerably approximate way. As to the National Assembly, in so far as it still towers eminent
 over France, after the manner of a car-borne _Carroccio_, though
 now no longer in the van; and rings signals for retreat or for
 advance,—it is and continues a reality among other realities. But
 in so far as it sits making the Constitution, on the other hand,
 it is a fatuity and chimera mainly. Alas, in the never so heroic
 building of Montesquieu-Mably card-castles, though shouted over
 by the world, what interest is there? Occupied in that way, an
 august National Assembly becomes for us little other than a
 Sanhedrim of pedants, not of the gerund-grinding, yet of no
 fruitfuller sort; and its loud debatings and recriminations about
 Rights of Man, Right of Peace and War, _Veto suspensif, Veto
 absolu_, what are they but so many Pedant’s-curses, “May God
 confound you for your _Theory of Irregular Verbs!_” A Constitution can be built, Constitutions enough _à la Sieyes:_
 but the frightful difficulty is that of getting men to come and
 live in them! Could Sieyes have drawn thunder and lightning out
 of Heaven to sanction his Constitution, it had been well: but
 without any thunder? Nay, strictly considered, is it not still
 true that without some such celestial sanction, given visibly in
 thunder or invisibly otherwise, no Constitution can in the long
 run be worth much more than the waste-paper it is written on? The
 Constitution, the set of Laws, or prescribed Habits of Acting,
 that men will live under, is the one which images their
 Convictions,—their Faith as to this wondrous Universe, and what
 rights, duties, capabilities they have there; which stands
 sanctioned therefore, by Necessity itself, if not by a seen
 Deity, then by an unseen one. Other laws, whereof there are
 always enough _ready_-made, are usurpations; which men do not
 obey, but rebel against, and abolish, by their earliest
 convenience. The question of questions accordingly were, Who is it that
 especially for rebellers and abolishers, can make a Constitution?
 He that can image forth the general Belief when there is one;
 that can impart one when, as here, there is none. A most rare
 man; ever as of old a god-missioned man! Here, however, in defect
 of such transcendent supreme man, Time with its infinite
 succession of merely superior men, each yielding his little
 contribution, does much. Force likewise (for, as Antiquarian
 Philosophers teach, the royal Sceptre was from the first
 something of a Hammer, to _crack_ such heads as could not be
 convinced) will all along find somewhat to do. And thus in
 perpetual abolition and reparation, rending and mending, with
 struggle and strife, with present evil and the hope and effort
 towards future good, must the Constitution, as all human things
 do, build itself forward; or unbuild itself, and sink, as it can
 and may. O Sieyes, and ye other Committeemen, and Twelve Hundred
 miscellaneous individuals from all parts of France! What is the
 Belief of France, and yours, if ye knew it? Properly that there
 shall be no Belief; that all formulas be swallowed. The
 Constitution which will suit that? Alas, too clearly, a
 No-Constitution, an Anarchy;—which also, in due season, shall be
 vouchsafed you. But, after all, what can an unfortunate National Assembly do?
 Consider only this, that there are Twelve Hundred miscellaneous
 individuals; not a unit of whom but has his own
 thinking-apparatus, his own speaking-apparatus! In every unit of
 them is some belief and wish, different for each, both that
 France should be regenerated, and also that he individually
 should do it. Twelve Hundred separate Forces, yoked
 miscellaneously to any object, miscellaneously to all sides of
 it; and bid pull for life!');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Or is it the nature of National Assemblies generally to do, with
 endless labour and clangour, Nothing? Are Representative
 Governments mostly at bottom Tyrannies too! Shall we say, the
 _Tyrants_, the ambitious contentious Persons, from all corners of
 the country do, in this manner, get gathered into one place; and
 there, with motion and counter-motion, with jargon and hubbub,
 _cancel_ one another, like the fabulous Kilkenny Cats; and
 produce, for net-result, _zero;_—the country meanwhile
 _governing_ or guiding _itself_, by such wisdom, recognised or
 for most part unrecognised, as may exist in individual heads here
 and there?—Nay, even that were a great improvement: for, of old,
 with their Guelf Factions and Ghibelline Factions, with their Red
 Roses and White Roses, they were wont to cancel the whole country
 as well. Besides they do it now in a much narrower cockpit;
 within the four walls of their Assembly House, and here and there
 an outpost of Hustings and Barrel-heads; do it with tongues too,
 not with swords:—all which improvements, in the art of producing
 zero, are they not great? Nay, best of all, some happy Continents
 (as the Western one, with its Savannahs, where whosoever has four
 willing limbs finds food under his feet, and an infinite sky over
 his head) can do without governing.—What Sphinx-questions; which
 the distracted world, in these very generations, must answer or
 die!
 Chapter 1.6.II.
 The Constituent Assembly. One thing an elected Assembly of Twelve Hundred is fit for:
 Destroying. Which indeed is but a more decided exercise of its
 natural talent for Doing Nothing. Do nothing, only keep
 agitating, debating; and things will destroy themselves. So and not otherwise proved it with an august National Assembly.
 It took the name, Constituent, as if its mission and function had
 been to construct or build; which also, with its whole soul, it
 endeavoured to do: yet, in the fates, in the nature of things,
 there lay for it precisely of all functions the most opposite to
 that. Singular, what Gospels men will believe; even Gospels
 according to Jean Jacques! It was the fixed Faith of these
 National Deputies, as of all thinking Frenchmen, that the
 Constitution could be _made;_ that they, there and then, were
 called to make it. How, with the toughness of Old Hebrews or
 Ishmaelite Moslem, did the otherwise light unbelieving People
 persist in this their _Credo quia impossibile;_ and front the
 armed world with it; and grow fanatic, and even heroic, and do
 exploits by it! The Constituent Assembly’s Constitution, and
 several others, will, being printed and not manuscript, survive
 to future generations, as an instructive well-nigh incredible
 document of the Time: the most significant Picture of the then
 existing France; or at lowest, Picture of these men’s Picture of
 it. But in truth and seriousness, what could the National Assembly
 have done? The thing to _be_ done was, actually as they said, to
 regenerate France; to abolish the old France, and make a new one;
 quietly or forcibly, by concession or by violence, this, by the
 Law of Nature, has become inevitable. With what degree of
 violence, depends on the wisdom of those that preside over it.
 With perfect wisdom on the part of the National Assembly, it had
 all been otherwise; but whether, in any wise, it could have been
 pacific, nay other than bloody and convulsive, may still be a
 question. Grant, meanwhile, that this Constituent Assembly does to the last
 continue to be something. With a sigh, it sees itself incessantly
 forced away from its infinite divine task, of perfecting “the
 Theory of Irregular Verbs,”—to finite terrestrial tasks, which
 latter have still a significance for us. It is the cynosure of
 revolutionary France, this National Assembly. All work of
 Government has fallen into its hands, or under its control; all
 men look to it for guidance. In the middle of that huge Revolt of
 Twenty-five millions, it hovers always aloft as _Carroccio_ or
 Battle-Standard, impelling and impelled, in the most confused
 way; if it cannot give much guidance, it will still seem to give
 some. It emits pacificatory Proclamations, not a few; with more
 or with less result. It authorises the enrolment of National
 Guards,—lest Brigands come to devour us, and reap the unripe
 crops. It sends missions to quell “effervescences;” to deliver
 men from the Lanterne. It can listen to congratulatory Addresses,
 which arrive daily by the sackful; mostly in King Cambyses’ vein:
 also to Petitions and complaints from all mortals; so that every
 mortal’s complaint, if it cannot get redressed, may at least hear
 itself complain. For the rest, an august National Assembly can
 produce Parliamentary Eloquence; and appoint Committees.
 Committees of the Constitution, of Reports, of Researches; and of
 much else: which again yield mountains of Printed Paper; the
 theme of new Parliamentary Eloquence, in bursts, or in plenteous
 smooth-flowing floods. And so, from the waste vortex whereon all
 things go whirling and grinding, Organic Laws, or the similitude
 of such, slowly emerge. With endless debating, we get the _Rights of Man_ written down
 and promulgated: true paper basis of all paper Constitutions.
 Neglecting, cry the opponents, to declare the Duties of Man!
 Forgetting, answer we, to ascertain the _Mights_ of Man;—one of
 the fatalest omissions!—Nay, sometimes, as on the Fourth of
 August, our National Assembly, fired suddenly by an almost
 preternatural enthusiasm, will get through whole masses of work
 in one night. A memorable night, this Fourth of August:
 Dignitaries temporal and spiritual; Peers, Archbishops,
 Parlement-Presidents, each outdoing the other in patriotic
 devotedness, come successively to throw their (untenable)
 possessions on the “altar of the fatherland.” With louder and
 louder vivats, for indeed it is “after dinner” too,—they abolish
 Tithes, Seignorial Dues, Gabelle, excessive Preservation of Game;
 nay Privilege, Immunity, Feudalism root and branch; then appoint
 a _Te Deum_ for it; and so, finally, disperse about three in the
 morning, striking the stars with their sublime heads. Such night,
 unforeseen but for ever memorable, was this of the Fourth of
 August 1789. Miraculous, or semi-miraculous, some seem to think
 it. A new Night of Pentecost, shall we say, shaped according to
 the new Time, and new Church of Jean Jacques Rousseau? It had its
 causes; also its effects. In such manner labour the National Deputies; perfecting their
 Theory of Irregular Verbs; governing France, and being governed
 by it; with toil and noise;—cutting asunder ancient intolerable
 bonds; and, for new ones, assiduously spinning ropes of sand.
 Were their labours a nothing or a something, yet the eyes of all
 France being reverently fixed on them, History can never very
 long leave them altogether out of sight. For the present, if we glance into that Assembly Hall of theirs,
 it will be found, as is natural, “most irregular.” As many as “a
 hundred members are on their feet at once;” no rule in making
 motions, or only commencements of a rule; Spectators’ Gallery
 allowed to applaud, and even to hiss;[200] President, appointed
 once a fortnight, raising many times no serene head above the
 waves. Nevertheless, as in all human Assemblages, like does begin
 arranging itself to like; the perennial rule, _Ubi homines sunt
 modi sunt_, proves valid. Rudiments of Methods disclose
 themselves; rudiments of Parties. There is a Right Side (_Côté
 Droit_), a Left Side (_Côté Gauche_); sitting on M. le
 President’s right hand, or on his left: the _Côté Droit_
 conservative; the _Côté Gauche_ destructive. Intermediate is
 Anglomaniac Constitutionalism, or Two-Chamber Royalism; with its
 Mouniers, its Lallys,—fast verging towards nonentity. Preeminent,
 on the Right Side, pleads and perorates Cazalès, the
 Dragoon-captain, eloquent, mildly fervent; earning for himself
 the shadow of a name. There also blusters Barrel-Mirabeau, the
 Younger Mirabeau, not without wit: dusky d’Espréménil does
 nothing but sniff and ejaculate; _might_, it is fondly thought,
 lay prostrate the Elder Mirabeau himself, would he but
 try,[201]—which he does not. Last and greatest, see, for one
 moment, the Abbé Maury; with his jesuitic eyes, his impassive
 brass face, “image of all the cardinal sins.” Indomitable,
 unquenchable, he fights jesuitico-rhetorically; with toughest
 lungs and heart; for Throne, especially for Altar and Tithes. So
 that a shrill voice exclaims once, from the Gallery: ‘Messieurs
 of the Clergy, you _have_ to be shaved; if you wriggle too much,
 you will get cut.’[202] The Left side is also called the d’Orléans side; and sometimes
 derisively, the Palais Royal. And yet, so confused,
 real-imaginary seems everything, “it is doubtful,” as Mirabeau
 said, “whether d’Orléans himself belong to that same d’Orléans
 Party.” What can be known and seen is, that his moon-visage does
 beam forth from that point of space. There likewise sits seagreen
 Robespierre; throwing in his light weight, with decision, not yet
 with effect. A thin lean Puritan and Precisian; he would make
 away with formulas; yet lives, moves, and has his being, wholly
 in formulas, of another sort. “_Peuple_,” such according to
 Robespierre ought to be the Royal method of promulgating laws,
 “_Peuple_, this is the Law I have framed for thee; dost thou
 accept it?”—answered from Right Side, from Centre and Left, by
 inextinguishable laughter.[203] Yet men of insight discern that
 the Seagreen may by chance go far: ‘this man,’ observes Mirabeau,
 ‘will do somewhat; he believes every word he says.’ Abbé Sieyes is busy with mere Constitutional work: wherein,
 unluckily, fellow-workmen are less pliable than, with one who has
 completed the Science of Polity, they ought to be. Courage,
 Sieyes nevertheless! Some twenty months of heroic travail, of
 contradiction from the stupid, and the Constitution shall be
 built; the top-stone of it brought out with shouting,—say rather,
 the top-paper, for it is all Paper; and _thou_ hast done in it
 what the Earth or the Heaven could require, thy utmost. Note
 likewise this Trio; memorable for several things; memorable were
 it only that their history is written in an epigram: “whatsoever
 these Three have in hand,” it is said, “Duport thinks it, Barnave
 speaks it, Lameth does it.”[204] But royal Mirabeau? Conspicuous among all parties, raised above
 and beyond them all, this man rises more and more. As we often
 say, he has an _eye_, he is a reality; while others are formulas
 and _eye_-glasses. In the Transient he will detect the Perennial,
 find some firm footing even among Paper-vortexes. His fame is
 gone forth to all lands; it gladdened the heart of the crabbed
 old Friend of Men himself before he died. The very Postilions of
 inns have heard of Mirabeau: when an impatient Traveller
 complains that the team is insufficient, his Postilion answers,
 ‘Yes, Monsieur, the wheelers are weak; but my _mirabeau_ (main
 horse), you see, is a right one, _mais mon mirabeau est
 excellent_.’[205] And now, Reader, thou shalt quit this noisy Discrepancy of a
 National Assembly; not (if thou be of humane mind) without pity.
 Twelve Hundred brother men are there, in the centre of
 Twenty-five Millions; fighting so fiercely with Fate and with one
 another; struggling their lives out, as most sons of Adam do, for
 that which profiteth not. Nay, on the whole, it is admitted
 further to be very _dull_. ‘Dull as this day’s Assembly,’ said
 some one. ‘Why date, _Pourquoi dater?_’ answered Mirabeau. Consider that they are Twelve Hundred; that they not only speak,
 but _read_ their speeches; and even borrow and steal speeches to
 read! With Twelve Hundred fluent speakers, and their Noah’s
 Deluge of vociferous commonplace, unattainable silence may well
 seem the one blessing of Life. But figure Twelve Hundred
 pamphleteers; droning forth perpetual pamphlets: and no man to
 gag them! Neither, as in the American Congress, do the
 arrangements seem perfect. A Senator has not his own Desk and
 Newspaper here; of Tobacco (much less of Pipes) there is not the
 slightest provision. Conversation itself must be transacted in a
 low tone, with continual interruption: only “pencil Notes”
 circulate freely; “in incredible numbers to the foot of the very
 tribune.”[206]—Such work is it, regenerating a Nation; perfecting
 one’s Theory of Irregular Verbs!
 Chapter 1.6.III.
 The General Overturn. Of the King’s Court, for the present, there is almost nothing
 whatever to be said. Silent, deserted are these halls; Royalty
 languishes forsaken of its war-god and all its hopes, till once
 the Œil-de-Bœuf rally again. The sceptre is departed from King
 Louis; is gone over to the _Salles des Menus_, to the Paris
 Townhall, or one knows not whither. In the July days, while all
 ears were yet deafened by the crash of the Bastille, and
 Ministers and Princes were scattered to the four winds, it seemed
 as if the very Valets had grown heavy of hearing. Besenval, also
 in flight towards Infinite Space, but hovering a little at
 Versailles, was addressing his Majesty personally for an Order
 about post-horses; when, lo, “the Valet in waiting places himself
 familiarly between his Majesty and me,” stretching out his rascal
 neck to learn what it was! His Majesty, in sudden choler, whirled
 round; made a clutch at the tongs: “I gently prevented him; he
 grasped my hand in thankfulness; and I noticed tears in his
 eyes.”[207] Poor King; for French Kings also are men! Louis Fourteenth
 himself once clutched the tongs, and even smote with them; but
 then it was at Louvois, and Dame Maintenon ran up.—The Queen sits
 weeping in her inner apartments, surrounded by weak women: she is
 “at the height of unpopularity;” universally regarded as the evil
 genius of France. Her friends and familiar counsellors have all
 fled; and fled, surely, on the foolishest errand. The Château
 Polignac still frowns aloft, on its “bold and enormous” cubical
 rock, amid the blooming champaigns, amid the blue girdling
 mountains of Auvergne:[208] but no Duke and Duchess Polignac look
 forth from it; they have fled, they have “met Necker at Bale;”
 they shall not return. That France should see her Nobles resist
 the Irresistible, Inevitable, with the face of angry men, was
 unhappy, not unexpected: but with the face and sense of pettish
 children? This was her peculiarity. They understood nothing;
 would understand nothing. Does not, at this hour, a new Polignac,
 first-born of these Two, sit reflective in the Castle of
 Ham;[209] in an astonishment he will never recover from; the most
 confused of existing mortals? King Louis has his new Ministry: mere Popularities; Old-President
 Pompignan; Necker, coming back in triumph; and other such.[210]
 But what will it avail him? As was said, the sceptre, all but the
 wooden gilt sceptre, has departed elsewhither. Volition,
 determination is not in this man: only innocence, indolence;
 dependence on all persons but himself, on all circumstances but
 the circumstances he were lord of. So troublous internally is our
 Versailles and its work. Beautiful, if seen from afar,
 resplendent like a Sun; seen near at hand, a mere
 Sun’s-Atmosphere, hiding darkness, confused ferment of ruin! But over France, there goes on the indisputablest “destruction of
 formulas;” transaction of realities that follow therefrom. So
 many millions of persons, all gyved, and nigh strangled, with
 formulas; whose Life nevertheless, at least the digestion and
 hunger of it, was real enough! Heaven has at length sent an
 abundant harvest; but what profits it the poor man, when Earth
 with her formulas interposes? Industry, in these times of
 Insurrection, must needs lie dormant; capital, as usual, not
 circulating, but stagnating timorously in nooks. The poor man is
 short of work, is therefore short of money; nay even had he
 money, bread is not to be bought for it. Were it plotting of
 Aristocrats, plotting of d’Orléans; were it Brigands,
 preternatural terror, and the clang of Phoebus Apollo’s silver
 bow,—enough, the markets are scarce of grain, plentiful only in
 tumult. Farmers seem lazy to thresh;—being either “bribed;” or
 needing no bribe, with prices ever rising, with perhaps rent
 itself no longer so pressing. Neither, what is singular, do
 municipal enactments, “That along with so many measures of wheat
 you shall sell so many of rye,” and other the like, much mend the
 matter. Dragoons with drawn swords stand ranked among the
 corn-sacks, often more dragoons than sacks.[211] Meal-mobs
 abound; growing into mobs of a still darker quality. Starvation has been known among the French Commonalty before
 this; known and familiar. Did we not see them, in the year 1775,
 presenting, in sallow faces, in wretchedness and raggedness,
 their Petition of Grievances; and, for answer, getting a
 brand-new Gallows forty feet high? Hunger and Darkness, through
 long years! For look back on that earlier Paris Riot, when a
 Great Personage, worn out by debauchery, was believed to be in
 want of Blood-baths; and Mothers, in worn raiment, yet with
 living hearts under it, “filled the public places” with their
 wild Rachel-cries,—stilled also by the Gallows. Twenty years ago,
 the Friend of Men (preaching to the deaf) described the Limousin
 Peasants as wearing a pain-stricken (_souffre-douleur_) look, a
 look _past_ complaint, “as if the oppression of the great were
 like the hail and the thunder, a thing irremediable, the
 ordinance of Nature.”[212] And now, if in some great hour, the
 shock of a falling Bastille should awaken you; and it were found
 to be the ordinance of Art merely; and remediable, reversible! Or has the Reader forgotten that “flood of savages,” which, in
 sight of the same Friend of Men, descended from the mountains at
 Mont d’Or? Lank-haired haggard faces; shapes rawboned, in high
 sabots; in woollen jupes, with leather girdles studded with
 copper-nails! They rocked from foot to foot, and beat time with
 their elbows too, as the quarrel and battle which was not long in
 beginning went on; shouting fiercely; the lank faces distorted
 into the similitude of a cruel laugh. For they were darkened and
 hardened: long had they been the prey of excise-men and tax-men;
 of “clerks with the cold spurt of their pen.” It was the fixed
 prophecy of our old Marquis, which no man would listen to, that
 “such Government by Blind-man’s-buff, stumbling along too far,
 would end by the General Overturn, the _Culbute Générale!_” No man would listen, each went his thoughtless way;—and Time and
 Destiny also travelled on. The Government by Blind-man’s-buff,
 stumbling along, has reached the precipice inevitable for it.
 Dull Drudgery, driven on, by clerks with the cold dastard spurt
 of their pen, has been driven—into a Communion of Drudges! For
 now, moreover, there have come the strangest confused tidings; by
 Paris Journals with their paper wings; or still more portentous,
 where no Journals are,[213] by rumour and conjecture: Oppression
 _not_ inevitable; a Bastille prostrate, and the Constitution fast
 getting ready! Which Constitution, if it be something and not
 nothing, what can it be but bread to eat? The Traveller, “walking up hill bridle in hand,” overtakes “a
 poor woman;” the image, as such commonly are, of drudgery and
 scarcity; “looking sixty years of age, though she is not yet
 twenty-eight.” They have seven children, her poor drudge and she:
 a farm, with one cow, which helps to make the children soup; also
 one little horse, or garron. They have rents and quit-rents, Hens
 to pay to this Seigneur, Oat-sacks to that; King’s taxes,
 Statute-labour, Church-taxes, taxes enough;—and think the times
 inexpressible. She has heard that some_where_, in some manner,
 some_thing_ is to be done for the poor: ‘God send it soon; for
 the dues and taxes crush us down (_nous écrasent_)!’[214] Fair prophecies are spoken, but they are not fulfilled. There
 have been Notables, Assemblages, turnings out and comings in.
 Intriguing and manœuvring; Parliamentary eloquence and arguing,
 Greek meeting Greek in high places, has long gone on; yet still
 bread comes not. The harvest is reaped and garnered; yet still we
 have no bread. Urged by despair and by hope, what can Drudgery
 do, but rise, as predicted, and produce the General Overturn? Fancy, then, some Five full-grown Millions of such gaunt figures,
 with their haggard faces (_figures hâves_); in woollen jupes,
 with copper-studded leather girths, and high sabots,—starting up
 to ask, as in forest-roarings, their washed Upper-Classes, after
 long unreviewed centuries, virtually this question: How have ye
 treated us; how have ye taught us, fed us, and led us, while we
 toiled for you? The answer can be read in flames, over the
 nightly summer sky. _This_ is the feeding and leading we have had
 of you: EMPTINESS,—of pocket, of stomach, of head, and of heart.
 Behold there is _nothing in us;_ nothing but what Nature gives
 her wild children of the desert: Ferocity and Appetite; Strength
 grounded on Hunger. Did ye mark among your Rights of Man, that
 man was not to die of starvation, while there was bread reaped by
 him? It is among the Mights of Man. Seventy-two Châteaus have flamed aloft in the Maconnais and
 Beaujolais alone: this seems the centre of the conflagration; but
 it has spread over Dauphiné, Alsace, the Lyonnais; the whole
 South-East is in a blaze. All over the North, from Rouen to Metz,
 disorder is abroad: smugglers of salt go openly in armed bands:
 the barriers of towns are burnt; toll-gatherers, tax-gatherers,
 official persons put to flight. “It was thought,” says Young,
 “the people, from hunger, would revolt;” and we see they have
 done it. Desperate Lackalls, long prowling aimless, now finding
 hope in desperation itself, everywhere form a nucleus. They ring
 the Church bell by way of tocsin: and the Parish turns out to the
 work.[215] Ferocity, atrocity; hunger and revenge: such work as
 we can imagine! Ill stands it now with the Seigneur, who, for example, “has
 walled up the only Fountain of the Township;” who has ridden high
 on his _chartier_ and parchments; who has preserved Game not
 wisely but too well. Churches also, and Canonries, are sacked,
 without mercy; which have shorn the flock too close, forgetting
 to feed it. Wo to the land over which Sansculottism, in its day
 of vengeance, tramps roughshod,—shod in sabots! Highbred
 Seigneurs, with their delicate women and little ones, had to “fly
 half-naked,” under cloud of night; glad to escape the flames, and
 even worse. You meet them at the _tables-d’hôte_ of inns; making
 wise reflections or foolish that “rank is destroyed;” uncertain
 whither they shall now wend.[216] The _métayer_ will find it
 convenient to be slack in paying rent. As for the Tax-gatherer,
 he, long hunting as a biped of prey, may now get hunted as one;
 his Majesty’s Exchequer will not “fill up the Deficit,” this
 season: it is the notion of many that a Patriot Majesty, being
 the Restorer of French Liberty, has abolished most taxes, though,
 for their private ends, some men make a secret of it. Where this will end? In the Abyss, one may prophecy; whither all
 Delusions are, at all moments, travelling; where this Delusion
 has now arrived. For if there be a Faith, from of old, it is
 this, as we often repeat, that no Lie can live for ever. The very
 Truth has to change its vesture, from time to time; and be born
 again. But all Lies have sentence of death written down against
 them, and Heaven’s Chancery itself; and, slowly or fast, advance
 incessantly towards their hour. “The sign of a Grand Seigneur
 being landlord,” says the vehement plain-spoken Arthur Young,
 “are wastes, _landes_, deserts, ling: go to his residence, you
 will find it in the middle of a forest, peopled with deer, wild
 boars and wolves. The fields are scenes of pitiable management,
 as the houses are of misery. To see so many millions of hands,
 that would be industrious, all idle and starving: Oh, if I were
 legislator of France, for one day, I would make these great lords
 skip again!”[217] O Arthur, thou now actually beholdest them
 _skip;_—wilt thou grow to grumble at that too? For long years and generations it lasted, but the time came.
 Featherbrain, whom no reasoning and no pleading could touch, the
 glare of the firebrand had to illuminate: there remained but that
 method. Consider it, look at it! The widow is gathering nettles
 for her children’s dinner; a perfumed Seigneur, delicately
 lounging in the Œil-de-Bœuf, has an alchemy whereby he will
 extract from her the third nettle, and name it Rent and Law: such
 an arrangement must end. Ought it? But, O most fearful is _such_
 an ending! Let those, to whom God, in His great mercy, has
 granted time and space, prepare another and milder one. To some it is a matter of wonder that the Seigneurs did not do
 something to help themselves; say, combine, and arm: for there
 were a “hundred and fifty thousand of them,” all violent enough.
 Unhappily, a hundred and fifty thousand, scattered over wide
 Provinces, divided by mutual ill-will, cannot combine. The
 highest Seigneurs, as we have seen, had already emigrated,—with a
 view of putting France to the blush. Neither are arms now the
 peculiar property of Seigneurs; but of every mortal who has ten
 shillings, wherewith to buy a secondhand firelock. Besides, those starving Peasants, after all, have not four feet
 and claws, that you could keep them down permanently in that
 manner. They are not even of black colour; they are mere Unwashed
 Seigneurs; and a Seigneur too has human bowels!—The Seigneurs did
 what they could; enrolled in National Guards; fled, with shrieks,
 complaining to Heaven and Earth. One Seigneur, famed Memmay of
 Quincey, near Vesoul, invited all the rustics of his
 neighbourhood to a banquet; blew up his Château and them with
 gunpowder; and instantaneously vanished, no man yet knows
 whither.[218] Some half dozen years after, he came back; and
 demonstrated that it was by accident. Nor are the authorities idle: though unluckily, all Authorities,
 Municipalities and such like, are in the uncertain transitionary
 state; getting regenerated from old Monarchic to new Democratic;
 no Official yet knows clearly what he is. Nevertheless, Mayors
 old or new do gather _Marechaussées_, National Guards, Troops of
 the line; justice, of the most summary sort, is not wanting. The
 Electoral Committee of Macon, though but a Committee, goes the
 length of hanging, for its own behoof, as many as twenty. The
 Prévôt of Dauphiné traverses the country “with a movable column,”
 with tipstaves, gallows-ropes; for gallows any tree will serve,
 and suspend its culprit, or “thirteen” culprits. Unhappy country! How is the fair gold-and-green of the ripe
 bright Year defaced with horrid blackness: black ashes of
 Châteaus, black bodies of gibetted Men! Industry has ceased in
 it; not sounds of the hammer and saw, but of the tocsin and
 alarm-drum. The sceptre has departed, _whither_ one knows
 not;—breaking itself in pieces: here impotent, there tyrannous.
 National Guards are unskilful, and of doubtful purpose; Soldiers
 are inclined to mutiny: there is danger that they two may
 quarrel, danger that they may _agree_. Strasburg has seen riots:
 a Townhall torn to shreds, its archives scattered white on the
 winds; drunk soldiers embracing drunk citizens for three days,
 and Mayor Dietrich and Marshal Rochambeau reduced nigh to
 desperation.[219] Through the middle of all which phenomena, is seen, on his
 triumphant transit, “escorted,” through Béfort for instance, “by
 fifty National Horsemen and all the military music of the
 place,”—M. Necker, returning from Bale! Glorious as the meridian;
 though poor Necker himself partly guesses whither it is
 leading.[220] One highest culminating day, at the Paris Townhall;
 with immortal vivats, with wife and daughter kneeling publicly to
 kiss his hand; with Besenval’s pardon granted,—but indeed revoked
 before sunset: one highest day, but then lower days, and ever
 lower, down even to lowest! Such magic is in a name; and in the
 want of a name. Like some enchanted Mambrino’s Helmet, essential
 to victory, comes this “Saviour of France;” beshouted,
 becymballed by the world:—alas, so soon, to be _dis_enchanted, to
 be pitched shamefully over the lists as a Barber’s Bason! Gibbon
 “could wish to shew him” (in this ejected, Barber’s-Bason state)
 to any man of solidity, who were minded to have the soul burnt
 out of him, and become a _caput mortuum_, by Ambition,
 unsuccessful or successful.[221] Another small phasis we add, and no more: how, in the Autumn
 months, our sharp-tempered Arthur has been “pestered for some
 days past,” by shot, lead-drops and slugs, “rattling five or six
 times into my chaise and about my ears;” all the mob of the
 country gone out to kill game![222] It is even so. On the Cliffs
 of Dover, over all the Marches of France, there appear, this
 autumn, two Signs on the Earth: emigrant flights of French
 Seigneurs; emigrant winged flights of French Game! Finished, one
 may say, or as good as finished, is the Preservation of Game on
 this Earth; completed for endless Time. What part it had to play
 in the History of Civilisation is played _plaudite; exeat!_ In this manner does Sansculottism blaze up, illustrating many
 things;—producing, among the rest, as we saw, on the Fourth of
 August, that semi-miraculous Night of Pentecost in the National
 Assembly; semi miraculous, which had its causes, and its effects.
 Feudalism is struck dead; not on parchment only, and by ink; but
 in very fact, by fire; say, by self-combustion. This
 conflagration of the South-East will abate; will be got
 scattered, to the West, or elsewhither: extinguish it will not,
 till the _fuel_ be all done.
 Chapter 1.6.IV.
 In Queue. If we look now at Paris, one thing is too evident: that the
 Baker’s shops have got their _Queues_, or Tails; their long
 strings of purchasers, arranged _in tail_, so that the first come
 be the first served,—were the shop once open! This waiting in
 tail, not seen since the early days of July, again makes its
 appearance in August. In time, we shall see it perfected by
 practice to the rank almost of an art; and the art, or quasi-art,
 of standing in tail become one of the characteristics of the
 Parisian People, distinguishing them from all other Peoples
 whatsoever. But consider, while work itself is so scarce, how a man must not
 only realise money; but stand waiting (if his wife is too weak to
 wait and struggle) for half days in the Tail, till he get it
 changed for dear bad bread! Controversies, to the length,
 sometimes of blood and battery, must arise in these exasperated
 Queues. Or if no controversy, then it is but one accordant _Pange
 Lingua_ of complaint against the Powers that be. France has begun
 her long Curriculum of Hungering, instructive and productive
 beyond Academic Curriculums; which extends over some seven most
 strenuous years. As Jean Paul says, of his own Life, “to a great
 height shall the business of Hungering go.”');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Or consider, in strange contrast, the jubilee Ceremonies; for, in
 general, the aspect of Paris presents these two features: jubilee
 ceremonials and scarcity of victual. Processions enough walk in
 jubilee; of Young Women, decked and dizened, their ribands all
 tricolor; moving with song and tabor, to the Shrine of Sainte
 Genevieve, to thank her that the Bastille is down. The Strong Men
 of the Market, and the Strong Women, fail not with their bouquets
 and speeches. Abbé Fauchet, famed in such work (for Abbé Lefevre
 could only distribute powder) blesses tricolor cloth for the
 National Guard; and makes it a National Tricolor Flag;
 victorious, or to be victorious, in the cause of civil and
 religious liberty all over the world. Fauchet, we say, is the man
 for _Te-Deums_, and public Consecrations;—to which, as in this
 instance of the Flag, our National Guard will “reply with volleys
 of musketry,” Church and Cathedral though it be;[223] filling
 Notre Dame with such noisiest fuliginous Amen, significant of
 several things. On the whole, we will say our new Mayor Bailly; our new Commander
 Lafayette, named also “Scipio-Americanus,” have bought their
 preferment dear. Bailly rides in gilt state-coach, with
 beefeaters and sumptuosity; Camille Desmoulins, and others,
 sniffing at him for it: Scipio bestrides the “white charger,” and
 waves with civic plumes in sight of all France. Neither of them,
 however, does it for nothing; but, in truth, at an exorbitant
 rate. At this rate, namely: of feeding Paris, and keeping it from
 fighting. Out of the City-funds, some seventeen thousand of the
 utterly destitute are employed digging on Montmartre, at tenpence
 a day, which buys them, at market price, almost two pounds of bad
 bread;—they look very yellow, when Lafayette goes to harangue
 them. The Townhall is in travail, night and day; it must bring
 forth Bread, a Municipal Constitution, regulations of all kinds,
 curbs on the Sansculottic Press; above all, Bread, Bread. Purveyors prowl the country far and wide, with the appetite of
 lions; detect hidden grain, purchase open grain; by gentle means
 or forcible, must and will find grain. A most thankless task; and
 so difficult, so dangerous,—even if a man did gain some trifle by
 it! On the 19th August, there is food for one day.[224]
 Complaints there are that the food is spoiled, and produces an
 effect on the intestines: not corn but plaster-of-Paris! Which
 effect on the intestines, as well as that “smarting in the throat
 and palate,” a Townhall Proclamation warns you to disregard, or
 even to consider as drastic-beneficial. The Mayor of Saint-Denis,
 so black was his bread, has, by a dyspeptic populace, been hanged
 on the Lanterne there. National Guards protect the Paris
 Corn-Market: first ten suffice; then six hundred.[225] Busy are
 ye, Bailly, Brissot de Warville, Condorcet, and ye others! For, as just hinted, there is a Municipal Constitution to be made
 too. The old Bastille Electors, after some ten days of
 psalmodying over their glorious victory, began to hear it asked,
 in a splenetic tone, Who put you there? They accordingly had to
 give place, not without moanings, and audible growlings on both
 sides, to a new larger Body, specially elected for that post.
 Which new Body, augmented, altered, then fixed finally at the
 number of Three Hundred, with the title of Town Representatives
 (_Représentans de la Commune_), now sits there; rightly portioned
 into Committees; assiduous making a Constitution; at all moments
 when not seeking flour. And such a Constitution; little short of miraculous: one that
 shall “consolidate the Revolution”! The Revolution is finished,
 then? Mayor Bailly and all respectable friends of Freedom would
 fain think so. Your Revolution, like jelly sufficiently _boiled_,
 needs only to be poured into _shapes_, of Constitution, and
 “consolidated” therein? Could it, indeed, contrive to _cool;_
 which last, however, is precisely the doubtful thing, or even the
 not doubtful! Unhappy friends of Freedom; consolidating a Revolution! They must
 sit at work there, their pavilion spread on very Chaos; between
 two hostile worlds, the Upper Court-world, the Nether
 Sansculottic one; and, beaten on by both, toil painfully,
 perilously,—doing, in sad literal earnest, “the impossible.”
 Chapter 1.6.V.
 The Fourth Estate. Pamphleteering opens its abysmal throat wider and wider: never to
 close more. Our Philosophes, indeed, rather withdraw; after the
 manner of Marmontel, “retiring in disgust the first day.” Abbé
 Raynal, grown gray and quiet in his Marseilles domicile, is
 little content with this work; the last literary act of the man
 will again be an act of rebellion: an indignant _Letter to the
 Constituent Assembly;_ answered by “the order of the day.” Thus
 also Philosophe Morellet puckers discontented brows; being indeed
 threatened in his benefices by that Fourth of August: it is
 clearly going too far. How astonishing that those “haggard
 figures in woollen jupes” would not rest as satisfied with
 Speculation, and victorious Analysis, as we! Alas, yes: Speculation, Philosophism, once the ornament and
 wealth of the saloon, will now coin itself into mere Practical
 Propositions, and circulate on street and highway, universally;
 with results! A Fourth Estate, of Able Editors, springs up;
 increases and multiplies; irrepressible, incalculable. New
 Printers, new Journals, and ever new (so prurient is the world),
 let our Three Hundred curb and consolidate as they can!
 Loustalot, under the wing of Prudhomme dull-blustering Printer,
 edits weekly his _Révolutions de Paris;_ in an acrid, emphatic
 manner. Acrid, corrosive, as the spirit of sloes and copperas, is
 Marat, _Friend of the People;_ struck already with the fact that
 the National Assembly, so full of Aristocrats, “can do nothing,”
 except dissolve itself, and make way for a better; that the
 Townhall Representatives are little other than babblers and
 imbeciles, if not even knaves. Poor is this man; squalid, and
 dwells in garrets; a man unlovely to the sense, outward and
 inward; a man forbid;—and is becoming fanatical, possessed with
 fixed-idea. Cruel _lusus_ of Nature! Did Nature, O poor Marat, as
 in cruel sport, knead thee out of her _leavings_, and
 miscellaneous waste clay; and fling thee forth stepdamelike, a
 Distraction into this distracted Eighteenth Century? Work is
 appointed thee there; which thou shalt do. The Three Hundred have
 summoned and will again summon Marat: but always he croaks forth
 answer sufficient; always he will defy them, or elude them; and
 endure no gag. Carra, “Ex-secretary of a decapitated Hospodar,” and then of a
 Necklace-Cardinal; likewise pamphleteer, Adventurer in many
 scenes and lands,—draws nigh to Mercier, of the _Tableau de
 Paris;_ and, with foam on his lips, proposes an _Annales
 Patriotiques_. The _Moniteur_ goes its prosperous way; Barrère
 “weeps,” on Paper as yet loyal; Rivarol, Royou are not idle. Deep
 calls to deep: your _Domine Salvum Fac Regem_ shall awaken _Pange
 Lingua;_ with an _Ami-du-Peuple_ there is a King’s-Friend
 Newspaper, _Ami-du-Roi_. Camille Desmoulins has appointed himself
 _Procureur-Général de la Lanterne_, Attorney-General of the
 Lamp-iron; and pleads, _not_ with atrocity, under an atrocious
 title; editing weekly his brilliant _Revolutions of Paris and
 Brabant_. Brilliant, we say: for if, in that thick murk of
 Journalism, with its dull blustering, with its fixed or loose
 fury, any ray of genius greet thee, be sure it is Camille’s. The
 thing that Camille teaches he, with his light finger, adorns:
 brightness plays, gentle, unexpected, amid horrible confusions;
 often is the word of Camille worth reading, when no other’s is.
 Questionable Camille, how thou glitterest with a fallen,
 rebellious, yet still semi-celestial light; as is the star-light
 on the brow of Lucifer! Son of the Morning, into what times and
 what lands, art thou fallen! But in all things is good;—though not good for “consolidating
 Revolutions.” Thousand wagon-loads of this Pamphleteering and
 Newspaper matter, lie rotting slowly in the Public Libraries of
 our Europe. Snatched from the great gulf, like oysters by
 bibliomaniac pearl-divers, there must they first _rot_, then what
 was pearl, in Camille or others, may be seen as such, and
 continue as such. Nor has public speaking declined, though Lafayette and his
 Patrols look sour on it. Loud always is the Palais Royal, loudest
 the Café de Foy; such a miscellany of Citizens and Citizenesses
 circulating there. “Now and then,” according to Camille, “some
 Citizens employ the liberty of the _press_ for a private purpose;
 so that this or the other Patriot finds himself short of his
 watch or pocket-handkerchief!” But, for the rest, in Camille’s
 opinion, nothing can be a livelier image of the Roman Forum. “A
 Patriot proposes his motion; if it finds any supporters, they
 make him mount on a chair, and speak. If he is applauded, he
 prospers and redacts; if he is hissed, he goes his ways.” Thus
 they, circulating and perorating. Tall shaggy Marquis
 Saint-Huruge, a man that has had losses, and has deserved them,
 is seen eminent, and also heard. “Bellowing” is the character of
 his voice, like that of a Bull of Bashan; voice which drowns all
 voices, which causes frequently the hearts of men to leap.
 Cracked or half-cracked is this tall Marquis’s head; uncracked
 are his lungs; the cracked and the uncracked shall alike avail
 him. Consider farther that each of the Forty-eight Districts has its
 own Committee; speaking and motioning continually; aiding in the
 search for grain, in the search for a Constitution; checking and
 spurring the poor Three Hundred of the Townhall. That Danton,
 with a “voice reverberating from the domes,” is President of the
 Cordeliers District; which has already become a Goshen of
 Patriotism. That apart from the “seventeen thousand utterly
 necessitous, digging on Montmartre,” most of whom, indeed, have
 got passes, and been dismissed into Space “with four
 shillings,”—there is a _strike_, or union, of Domestics out of
 place; who assemble for public speaking: next, a strike of
 Tailors, for even they will strike and speak; further, a strike
 of Journeymen Cordwainers; a strike of Apothecaries: so dear is
 bread.[226] All these, having struck, must speak; generally under
 the open canopy; and pass resolutions;—Lafayette and his Patrols
 watching them suspiciously from the distance. Unhappy mortals: such tugging and lugging, and throttling of one
 another, to divide, in some not intolerable way, the joint
 Felicity of man in this Earth; when the whole lot to be divided
 is such a “feast of _shells!_”—Diligent are the Three Hundred;
 none equals Scipio Americanus in dealing with mobs. But surely
 all these things bode ill for the consolidating of a Revolution.
 BOOK VII.
 THE INSURRECTION OF WOMEN
 Chapter 1.7.I.
 Patrollotism. No, Friends, this Revolution is not of the consolidating kind. Do
 not fires, fevers, sown seeds, chemical mixtures, men, events;
 all embodiments of Force that work in this miraculous Complex of
 Forces, named Universe,—go on _growing_, through their natural
 phases and developments, each according to its kind; reach their
 height, reach their visible decline; finally sink under,
 vanishing, and what we call _die?_ They all grow; there is
 nothing but what grows, and shoots forth into its special
 expansion,—once give it leave to spring. Observe too that each
 grows with a rapidity proportioned, in general, to the madness
 and unhealthiness there is in it: slow regular growth, though
 this also ends in death, is what we name health and sanity. A Sansculottism, which has prostrated Bastilles, which has got
 pike and musket, and now goes burning Châteaus, passing
 resolutions and haranguing under roof and sky, may be said to
 have sprung; and, by law of Nature, must grow. To judge by the
 madness and diseasedness both of itself, and of the soil and
 element it is in, one might expect the rapidity and monstrosity
 would be extreme. Many things too, especially all diseased things, grow by shoots
 and fits. The first grand fit and shooting forth of Sansculottism
 with that of Paris conquering its King; for Bailly’s figure of
 rhetoric was all-too sad a reality. The King is conquered; going
 at large on his parole; on condition, say, of absolutely good
 behaviour,—which, in these circumstances, will unhappily mean no
 behaviour whatever. A quite untenable position, that of Majesty
 put on its good behaviour! Alas, is it not natural that whatever
 lives try to keep itself living? Whereupon his Majesty’s
 behaviour will soon become exceptionable; and so the Second grand
 Fit of Sansculottism, that of putting him in durance, cannot be
 distant. Necker, in the National Assembly, is making moan, as usual about
 his Deficit: Barriers and Customhouses burnt; the Tax-gatherer
 hunted, not hunting; his Majesty’s Exchequer all but empty. The
 remedy is a Loan of thirty millions; then, on still more enticing
 terms, a Loan of eighty millions: neither of which Loans,
 unhappily, will the Stockjobbers venture to lend. The Stockjobber
 has no country, except his own black pool of _Agio_. And yet, in those days, for men that have a country, what a glow
 of patriotism burns in many a heart; penetrating inwards to the
 very purse! So early as the 7th of August, a _Don Patriotique_,
 “a Patriotic Gift of jewels to a considerable extent,” has been
 solemnly made by certain Parisian women; and solemnly accepted,
 with honourable mention. Whom forthwith all the world takes to
 imitating and emulating. Patriotic Gifts, always with some heroic
 eloquence, which the President must answer and the Assembly
 listen to, flow in from far and near: in such number that the
 honourable mention can only be performed in “lists published at
 stated epochs.” Each gives what he can: the very cordwainers have
 behaved munificently; one landed proprietor gives a forest;
 fashionable society gives its shoebuckles, takes cheerfully to
 shoe-ties. Unfortunate females give what they “have amassed in
 loving.”[227] The smell of all cash, as Vespasian thought, is
 good. Beautiful, and yet inadequate! The Clergy must be “invited” to
 melt their superfluous Church-plate,—in the Royal Mint. Nay
 finally, a Patriotic Contribution, of the forcible sort, must be
 determined on, though unwillingly: let the fourth part of your
 declared yearly revenue, for this once only, be paid down; so
 shall a National Assembly make the Constitution, undistracted at
 least by insolvency. Their own wages, as settled on the 17th of
 August, are but Eighteen Francs a day, each man; but the Public
 Service must have sinews, must have money. To _appease_ the
 Deficit; not to “_combler_, or choke the Deficit,” if you or
 mortal could! For withal, as Mirabeau was heard saying, ‘it is
 the Deficit that saves us.’ Towards the end of August, our National Assembly in its
 constitutional labours, has got so far as the question of _Veto:_
 shall Majesty have a Veto on the National Enactments; or not have
 a Veto? What speeches were spoken, within doors and without;
 clear, and also passionate logic; imprecations, comminations;
 gone happily, for most part, to Limbo! Through the cracked brain,
 and uncracked lungs of Saint-Huruge, the Palais Royal rebellows
 with Veto. Journalism is busy, France rings with Veto. “I shall
 never forget,” says Dumont, “my going to Paris, one of these
 days, with Mirabeau; and the crowd of people we found waiting for
 his carriage, about Le Jay the Bookseller’s shop. They flung
 themselves before him; conjuring him with tears in their eyes not
 to suffer the _Veto Absolu_. They were in a frenzy: ‘Monsieur le
 Comte, you are the people’s father; you must save us; you must
 defend us against those villains who are bringing back Despotism.
 If the King get this Veto, what is the use of National Assembly?
 We are slaves, all is done.’”[228] Friends, _if_ the sky fall,
 there will be catching of larks! Mirabeau, adds Dumont, was
 eminent on such occasions: he answered vaguely, with a Patrician
 imperturbability, and bound himself to nothing. Deputations go to the Hôtel-de-Ville; anonymous Letters to
 Aristocrats in the National Assembly, threatening that fifteen
 thousand, or sometimes that sixty thousand, “will march to
 illuminate you.” The Paris Districts are astir; Petitions
 signing: Saint-Huruge sets forth from the Palais Royal, with an
 escort of fifteen hundred individuals, to petition in person.
 Resolute, or seemingly so, is the tall shaggy Marquis, is the
 Café de Foy: but resolute also is Commandant-General Lafayette.
 The streets are all beset by Patrols: Saint-Huruge is stopped at
 the _Barrière des Bon Hommes;_ he may bellow like the bulls of
 Bashan; but absolutely must return. The brethren of the Palais
 Royal “circulate all night,” and make motions, under the open
 canopy; all Coffee-houses being shut. Nevertheless Lafayette and
 the Townhall do prevail: Saint-Huruge is thrown into prison;
 _Veto Absolu_ adjusts itself into _Suspensive Veto_, prohibition
 not forever, but for a term of time; and this doom’s-clamour will
 grow silent, as the others have done. So far has Consolidation prospered, though with difficulty;
 repressing the Nether Sansculottic world; and the Constitution
 shall be made. With difficulty: amid jubilee and scarcity;
 Patriotic Gifts, Bakers’-queues; Abbé-Fauchet Harangues, with
 their _Amen_ of platoon-musketry! Scipio Americanus has deserved
 thanks from the National Assembly and France. They offer him
 stipends and emoluments, to a handsome extent; all which stipends
 and emoluments he, covetous of far other blessedness than mere
 money, does, in his chivalrous way, without scruple, refuse. To the Parisian common man, meanwhile, one thing remains
 inconceivable: that now when the Bastille is down, and French
 Liberty restored, grain should continue so dear. Our Rights of
 Man are voted, Feudalism and all Tyranny abolished; yet behold we
 stand _in queue!_ Is it Aristocrat forestallers; a Court still
 bent on intrigues? Something is rotten, somewhere. And yet, alas, what to do? Lafayette, with his Patrols prohibits
 every thing, even complaint. Saint-Huruge and other heroes of the
 _Veto_ lie in durance. People’s-Friend Marat was seized; Printers
 of Patriotic Journals are fettered and forbidden; the very
 Hawkers cannot cry, till they get license, and leaden badges.
 Blue National Guards ruthlessly dissipate all groups; scour, with
 levelled bayonets, the Palais Royal itself. Pass, on your
 affairs, along the Rue Taranne, the Patrol, presenting his
 bayonet, cries, _To the left!_ Turn into the Rue Saint-Benoit, he
 cries, _To the right!_ A judicious Patriot (like Camille
 Desmoulins, in this instance) is driven, for quietness’s sake, to
 take the gutter. O much-suffering People, our glorious Revolution is evaporating
 in tricolor ceremonies, and complimentary harangues! Of which
 latter, as Loustalot acridly calculates, “upwards of two thousand
 have been delivered within the last month, at the Townhall
 alone.”[229] And our mouths, unfilled with bread, are to be shut,
 under penalties? The Caricaturist promulgates his emblematic
 Tablature: _Le Patrouillotisme chassant le Patriotisme_,
 Patriotism driven out by Patrollotism. Ruthless Patrols; long
 superfine harangues; and scanty ill-baked loaves, more like baked
 Bath bricks,—which produce an effect on the intestines! Where
 will this end? In consolidation?
 Chapter 1.7.II.
 O Richard, O my King. For, alas, neither is the Townhall itself without misgivings. The
 Nether Sansculottic world has been suppressed hitherto: but then
 the Upper Court-world! Symptoms there are that the Œil-de-Bœuf is
 rallying. More than once in the Townhall Sanhedrim; often enough, from
 those outspoken Bakers’-queues, has the wish uttered itself: O
 that our Restorer of French Liberty were here; that he could see
 with his own eyes, not with the false eyes of Queens and Cabals,
 and his really good heart be enlightened! For falsehood still
 environs him; intriguing Dukes de Guiche, with Bodyguards; scouts
 of Bouillé; a new flight of intriguers, now that the old is
 flown. What else means this advent of the _Regiment de Flandre;_
 entering Versailles, as we hear, on the 23rd of September, with
 two pieces of cannon? Did not the Versailles National Guard do
 duty at the Château? Had they not Swiss; Hundred Swiss;
 _Gardes-du-Corps_, Bodyguards so-called? Nay, it would seem, the
 number of Bodyguards on duty has, by a manœuvre, been doubled:
 the new relieving Battalion of them arrived at its time; but the
 old relieved one does not _depart!_ Actually, there runs a whisper through the best informed
 Upper-Circles, or a nod still more potentous than whispering, of
 his Majesty’s flying to Metz; of a Bond (to stand by him therein)
 which has been signed by Noblesse and Clergy, to the incredible
 amount of thirty, or even of sixty thousand. Lafayette coldly
 whispers it, and coldly asseverates it, to Count d’Estaing at the
 Dinner-table; and d’Estaing, one of the bravest men, quakes to
 the core lest some lackey overhear it; and tumbles thoughtful,
 without sleep, all night.[230] Regiment Flandre, as we said, is
 clearly arrived. His Majesty, they say, hesitates about
 sanctioning the Fourth of August; makes observations, of chilling
 tenor, on the very Rights of Man! Likewise, may not all persons,
 the Bakers’-queues themselves discern on the streets of Paris,
 the most astonishing number of Officers on furlough, Crosses of
 St. Louis, and such like? Some reckon “from a thousand to twelve
 hundred.” Officers of all uniforms; nay one uniform never before
 seen by eye: green faced with red! The tricolor cockade is not
 always visible: but what, in the name of Heaven, may these
 _black_ cockades, which some wear, foreshadow? Hunger whets everything, especially Suspicion and Indignation.
 Realities themselves, in this Paris, have grown unreal:
 preternatural. Phantasms once more stalk through the brain of
 hungry France. O ye laggards and dastards, cry shrill voices from
 the Queues, if ye had the hearts of men, ye would take your pikes
 and secondhand firelocks, and look into it; not leave your wives
 and daughters to be starved, murdered, and worse!—Peace, women!
 The heart of man is bitter and heavy; Patriotism, driven out by
 Patrollotism, knows not what to resolve on. The truth is, the Œil-de-Bœuf has rallied; to a certain unknown
 extent. A changed Œil-de-Bœuf; with Versailles National Guards,
 in their tricolor cockades, doing duty there; a Court all flaring
 with tricolor! Yet even to a tricolor Court men will rally. Ye
 loyal hearts, burnt-out Seigneurs, rally round your Queen! With
 wishes; which will produce hopes; which will produce attempts! For indeed self-preservation being such a law of Nature, what can
 a rallied Court do, but attempt and endeavour, or call it
 _plot_,—with such wisdom and unwisdom as it has? They will fly,
 escorted, to Metz, where brave Bouillé commands; they will raise
 the Royal Standard: the Bond-signatures shall become armed men.
 Were not the King so languid! Their Bond, if at all signed, must
 be signed without his privity.—Unhappy King, _he_ has but one
 resolution: not to have a civil war. For the rest, he still
 hunts, having ceased lockmaking; he still dozes, and digests; is
 clay in the hands of the potter. Ill will it fare with him, in a
 world where all is helping itself; where, as has been written,
 “whosoever is not hammer must be stithy;” and “the very hyssop on
 the wall grows there, in that chink, because the whole Universe
 could not prevent its growing!” But as for the coming up of this Regiment de Flandre, may it not
 be urged that there were Saint-Huruge Petitions, and continual
 meal-mobs? Undebauched Soldiers, be there plot, or only dim
 elements of a plot, are always good. Did not the Versailles
 Municipality (an old Monarchic one, not yet refounded into a
 Democratic) instantly second the proposal? Nay the very
 Versailles National Guard, wearied with continual duty at the
 Château, did not object; only Draper Lecointre, who is now Major
 Lecointre, shook his head.—Yes, Friends, surely it was natural
 this Regiment de Flandre should be sent for, since it could be
 got. It was natural that, at sight of military bandoleers, the
 heart of the rallied Œil-de-Bœuf should revive; and Maids of
 Honour, and gentlemen of honour, speak comfortable words to
 epauletted defenders, and to one another. Natural also, and mere
 common civility, that the Bodyguards, a Regiment of Gentlemen,
 should invite their Flandre brethren to a Dinner of welcome!—Such
 invitation, in the last days of September, is given and accepted. Dinners are defined as “the _ultimate_ act of communion;” men
 that can have communion in nothing else, can sympathetically eat
 together, can still rise into some glow of brotherhood over food
 and wine. The dinner is fixed on, for Thursday the First of
 October; and ought to have a fine effect. Further, as such Dinner
 may be rather extensive, and even the Noncommissioned and the
 Common man be introduced, to see and to hear, could not His
 Majesty’s Opera Apartment, which has lain quite silent ever since
 Kaiser Joseph was here, be obtained for the purpose?—The Hall of
 the Opera is granted; the Salon d’Hercule shall be drawingroom.
 Not only the Officers of Flandre, but of the Swiss, of the
 Hundred Swiss, nay of the Versailles National Guard, such of them
 as have any loyalty, shall feast: it will be a Repast like few. And now suppose this Repast, the solid part of it, transacted;
 and the first bottle over. Suppose the customary loyal toasts
 drunk; the King’s health, the Queen’s with deafening vivats;—that
 of the Nation “omitted,” or even “rejected.” Suppose champagne
 flowing; with pot-valorous speech, with instrumental music; empty
 feathered heads growing ever the noisier, in their own emptiness,
 in each other’s noise! Her Majesty, who looks unusually sad
 tonight (his Majesty sitting dulled with the day’s hunting), is
 told that the sight of it would cheer her. Behold! She enters
 there, issuing from her State-rooms, like the Moon from the
 clouds, this fairest unhappy Queen of Hearts; royal Husband by
 her side, young Dauphin in her arms! She descends from the Boxes,
 amid splendour and acclaim; walks queen-like, round the Tables;
 gracefully escorted, gracefully nodding; her looks full of
 sorrow, yet of gratitude and daring, with the hope of France on
 her mother-bosom! And now, the band striking up, _O Richard, O
 mon Roi, l’univers t’abandonne_ (O Richard, O my King, and world
 is all forsaking thee)—could man do other than rise to height of
 pity, of loyal valour? Could featherheaded young ensigns do other
 than, by white Bourbon Cockades, handed them from fair fingers;
 by waving of swords, drawn to pledge the Queen’s health; by
 trampling of National Cockades; by scaling the Boxes, whence
 intrusive murmurs may come; by vociferation, tripudiation, sound,
 fury and distraction, within doors and without,—testify what
 tempest-tost state of vacuity they are in? Till champagne and
 tripudiation do their work; and all lie silent, horizontal;
 passively slumbering, with meed-of-battle dreams!— A natural Repast, in ordinary times, a harmless one: now fatal,
 as that of Thyestes; as that of Job’s Sons, when a strong wind
 smote the four corners of their banquet-house! Poor ill-advised
 Marie-Antoinette; with a woman’s vehemence, not with a
 sovereign’s foresight! It was so natural, yet so unwise. Next
 day, in public speech of ceremony, her Majesty declares herself
 “delighted with the Thursday.” The heart of the Œil-de-Bœuf glows into hope; into daring, which
 is premature. Rallied Maids of Honour, waited on by Abbés, sew
 “white cockades;” distribute them, with words, with glances, to
 epauletted youths; who in return, may kiss, not without fervour,
 the fair sewing fingers. Captains of horse and foot go swashing
 with “enormous white cockades;” nay one Versailles National
 Captain had mounted the like, so witching were the words and
 glances; and laid aside his tricolor! Well may Major Lecointre
 shake his head with a look of severity; and speak audible
 resentful words. But now a swashbuckler, with enormous white
 cockade, overhearing the Major, invites him insolently, once and
 then again elsewhere, to recant; and failing that, to duel. Which
 latter feat Major Lecointre declares that he will not perform,
 not at least by any known laws of fence; that he nevertheless
 will, according to mere law of Nature, by dirk and blade,
 “exterminate” any “vile gladiator,” who may insult him or the
 Nation;—whereupon (for the Major is actually drawing his
 implement) “they are parted,” and no weasands slit.[231]
 Chapter 1.7.III.
 Black Cockades. But fancy what effect this Thyestes Repast and trampling on the
 National Cockade, must have had in the _Salle des Menus;_ in the
 famishing Bakers’-queues at Paris! Nay such Thyestes Repasts, it
 would seem, continue. Flandre has given its Counter-Dinner to the
 Swiss and Hundred Swiss; then on Saturday there has been another. Yes, here with us is famine; but yonder at Versailles is food;
 enough and to spare! Patriotism stands in queue, shivering
 hungerstruck, insulted by Patrollotism; while bloodyminded
 Aristocrats, heated with excess of high living, trample on the
 National Cockade. Can the atrocity be true? Nay, look: green
 uniforms faced with red; black cockades,—the colour of Night! Are
 we to have military onfall; and death also by starvation? For
 behold the Corbeil Cornboat, which used to come twice a-day, with
 its Plaster-of-Paris meal, now comes only once. And the Townhall
 is deaf; and the men are laggard and dastard!—At the Café de Foy,
 this Saturday evening, a new thing is seen, not the last of its
 kind: a woman engaged in public speaking. Her poor man, she says,
 was put to silence by his District; their Presidents and
 Officials would not let him speak. Wherefore she here with her
 shrill tongue will speak; denouncing, while her breath endures,
 the Corbeil-Boat, the Plaster-of-Paris bread, sacrilegious
 Opera-dinners, green uniforms, Pirate Aristocrats, and those
 black cockades of theirs!— Truly, it is time for the black cockades at least, to vanish.
 Them Patrollotism itself will not protect. Nay, sharp-tempered
 “M. Tassin,” at the Tuileries parade on Sunday morning, forgets
 all National military rule; starts from the ranks, wrenches down
 one black cockade which is swashing ominous there; and tramples
 it fiercely into the soil of France. Patrollotism itself is not
 without suppressed fury. Also the Districts begin to stir; the
 voice of President Danton reverberates in the Cordeliers:
 People’s-Friend Marat has flown to Versailles and back
 again;—swart bird, not of the halcyon kind![232]');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' And so Patriot meets promenading Patriot, this Sunday; and sees
 his own grim care reflected on the face of another. Groups, in
 spite of Patrollotism, which is not so alert as usual, fluctuate
 deliberative: groups on the Bridges, on the Quais, at the
 patriotic Cafés. And ever as any black cockade may emerge, rises
 the many-voiced growl and bark: _À bas_, Down! All black cockades
 are ruthlessly plucked off: one individual picks his up again;
 kisses it, attempts to refix it; but a “hundred canes start into
 the air,” and he desists. Still worse went it with another
 individual; doomed, by extempore _Plebiscitum_, to the Lanterne;
 saved, with difficulty, by some active
 _Corps-de-Garde_.—Lafayette sees signs of an effervescence; which
 he doubles his Patrols, doubles his diligence, to prevent. So
 passes Sunday, the 4th of October 1789. Sullen is the male heart, repressed by Patrollotism; vehement is
 the female, irrepressible. The public-speaking woman at the
 Palais Royal was not the only speaking one:—Men know not what the
 pantry is, when it grows empty, only house-mothers know. O women,
 wives of men that will only calculate and not act! Patrollotism
 is strong; but Death, by starvation and military onfall, is
 stronger. Patrollotism represses male Patriotism: but female
 Patriotism? Will Guards named National thrust their bayonets into
 the bosoms of women? Such thought, or rather such dim unshaped
 raw-material of a thought, ferments universally under the female
 night-cap; and, by earliest daybreak, on slight hint, will
 explode.
 Chapter 1.7.IV.
 The Menads. If Voltaire once, in splenetic humour, asked his countrymen: ‘But
 you, _Gualches_, what have you invented?’ they can now answer:
 The Art of Insurrection. It was an art needed in these last
 singular times: an art, for which the French nature, so full of
 vehemence, so free from depth, was perhaps of all others the
 fittest. Accordingly, to what a height, one may well say of perfection,
 has this branch of human industry been carried by France, within
 the last half-century! Insurrection, which, Lafayette thought,
 might be “the most sacred of duties,” ranks now, for the French
 people, among the duties which they can perform. Other mobs are
 dull masses; which roll onwards with a dull fierce tenacity, a
 dull fierce heat, but emit no light-flashes of genius as they go.
 The French mob, again, is among the liveliest phenomena of our
 world. So rapid, audacious; so clear-sighted, inventive, prompt
 to seize the moment; instinct with life to its finger-ends! That
 talent, were there no other, of spontaneously standing in queue,
 distinguishes, as we said, the French People from all Peoples,
 ancient and modern. Let the Reader confess too that, taking one thing with another,
 perhaps few terrestrial Appearances are better worth considering
 than mobs. Your mob is a genuine outburst of Nature; issuing
 from, or communicating with, the deepest deep of Nature. When so
 much goes grinning and grimacing as a lifeless Formality, and
 under the stiff buckram no heart can be felt beating, here once
 more, if nowhere else, is a Sincerity and Reality. Shudder at it;
 or even shriek over it, if thou must; nevertheless consider it.
 Such a Complex of human Forces and Individualities hurled forth,
 in their transcendental mood, to act and react, on circumstances
 and on one another; to work out what it is in them to work. The
 thing they will do is known to no man; least of all to
 themselves. It is the inflammablest immeasurable Fire-work,
 generating, consuming itself. With what phases, to what extent,
 with what results it will burn off, Philosophy and Perspicacity
 conjecture in vain. “Man,” as has been written, “is for ever interesting to man; nay
 properly there is nothing else interesting.” In which light also,
 may we not discern why most Battles have become so wearisome?
 Battles, in these ages, are transacted by mechanism; with the
 slightest possible developement of human individuality or
 spontaneity: men now even die, and kill one another, in an
 artificial manner. Battles ever since Homer’s time, when they
 were Fighting Mobs, have mostly ceased to be worth looking at,
 worth reading of, or remembering. How many wearisome bloody
 Battles does History strive to represent; or even, in a husky
 way, to sing:—and she would omit or carelessly slur-over this one
 Insurrection of Women? A thought, or dim raw-material of a thought, was fermenting all
 night, universally in the female head, and might explode. In
 squalid garret, on Monday morning, Maternity awakes, to hear
 children weeping for bread. Maternity must forth to the streets,
 to the herb-markets and Bakers’—queues; meets there with
 hunger-stricken Maternity, sympathetic, exasperative. O we
 unhappy women! But, instead of Bakers’-queues, why not to
 Aristocrats’ palaces, the root of the matter? _Allons!_ Let us
 assemble. To the Hôtel-de-Ville; to Versailles; to the Lanterne! In one of the Guardhouses of the Quartier Saint-Eustache, “a
 young woman” seizes a drum,—for how shall National Guards give
 fire on women, on a young woman? The young woman seizes the drum;
 sets forth, beating it, “uttering cries relative to the dearth of
 grains.” Descend, O mothers; descend, ye Judiths, to food and
 revenge!—All women gather and go; crowds storm all stairs, force
 out all women: the female Insurrectionary Force, according to
 Camille, resembles the English Naval one; there is a universal
 “Press of women.” Robust Dames of the Halle, slim Mantua-makers,
 assiduous, risen with the dawn; ancient Virginity tripping to
 matins; the Housemaid, with early broom; all must go. Rouse ye, O
 women; the laggard men will not act; they say, we ourselves may
 act! And so, like snowbreak from the mountains, for every staircase is
 a melted brook, it storms; tumultuous, wild-shrilling, towards
 the Hôtel-de-Ville. Tumultuous, with or without drum-music: for
 the Faubourg Saint-Antoine also has tucked up its gown; and, with
 besom-staves, fire-irons, and even rusty pistols (void of
 ammunition), is flowing on. Sound of it flies, with a velocity of
 sound, to the outmost Barriers. By seven o’clock, on this raw
 October morning, fifth of the month, the Townhall will see
 wonders. Nay, as chance would have it, a male party are already
 there; clustering tumultuously round some National Patrol, and a
 Baker who has been seized with short weights. They are there; and
 have even lowered the rope of the Lanterne. So that the official
 persons have to smuggle forth the short-weighing Baker by back
 doors, and even send “to all the Districts” for more force. Grand it was, says Camille, to see so many Judiths, from eight to
 ten thousand of them in all, rushing out to search into the root
 of the matter! Not unfrightful it must have been;
 ludicro-terrific, and most unmanageable. At such hour the
 overwatched Three Hundred are not yet stirring: none but some
 Clerks, a company of National Guards; and M. de Gouvion, the
 Major-general. Gouvion has fought in America for the cause of
 civil Liberty; a man of no inconsiderable heart, but deficient in
 head. He is, for the moment, in his back apartment; assuaging
 Usher Maillard, the Bastille-serjeant, who has come, as too many
 do, with “representations.” The assuagement is still incomplete
 when our Judiths arrive. The National Guards form on the outer stairs, with levelled
 bayonets; the ten thousand Judiths press up, resistless; with
 obtestations, with outspread hands,—merely to speak to the Mayor.
 The rear forces them; nay, from male hands in the rear, stones
 already fly: the National Guards must do one of two things; sweep
 the Place de Grève with cannon, or else open to right and left.
 They open; the living deluge rushes in. Through all rooms and
 cabinets, upwards to the topmost belfry: ravenous; seeking arms,
 seeking Mayors, seeking justice;—while, again, the better-cressed
 (dressed?) speak kindly to the Clerks; point out the misery of
 these poor women; also their ailments, some even of an
 interesting sort.[233] Poor M. de Gouvion is shiftless in this extremity;—a man
 shiftless, perturbed; who will one day commit suicide. How happy
 for him that Usher Maillard, the shifty, was there, at the
 moment, though making representations! Fly back, thou shifty
 Maillard; seek the Bastille Company; and O return fast with it;
 above all, with thy own shifty head! For, behold, the Judiths can
 find no Mayor or Municipal; scarcely, in the topmost belfry, can
 they find poor Abbé Lefevre the Powder-distributor. Him, for want
 of a better, they suspend there; in the pale morning light; over
 the top of all Paris, which swims in one’s failing eyes:—a
 horrible end? Nay, the rope broke, as French ropes often did; or
 else an Amazon cut it. Abbé Lefevre falls, some twenty feet,
 rattling among the leads; and lives long years after, though
 always with “a _tremblement_ in the limbs.”[234] And now doors fly under hatchets; the Judiths have broken the
 Armoury; have seized guns and cannons, three money-bags,
 paper-heaps; torches flare: in few minutes, our brave
 Hôtel-de-Ville which dates from the Fourth Henry, will, with all
 that it holds, be in flames!
 Chapter 1.7.V.
 Usher Maillard. In flames, truly,—were it not that Usher Maillard, swift of foot,
 shifty of head, has returned! Maillard, of his own motion, for Gouvion or the rest would not
 even sanction him,—snatches a drum; descends the Porch-stairs,
 ran-tan, beating sharp, with loud rolls, his Rogues’-march: To
 Versailles! _Allons; a Versailles!_ As men beat on kettle or
 warmingpan, when angry she-bees, or say, flying desperate wasps,
 are to be hived; and the desperate insects hear it, and cluster
 round it,—simply as round a guidance, where there was none: so
 now these Menads round shifty Maillard, Riding-Usher of the
 Châtelet. The axe pauses uplifted; Abbé Lefevre is left
 half-hanged; from the belfry downwards all vomits itself. What
 rub-a-dub is that? Stanislas Maillard, Bastille-hero, will lead
 us to Versailles? Joy to thee, Maillard; blessed art thou above
 Riding-Ushers! Away then, away! The seized cannon are yoked with seized cart-horses: brown-locked
 Demoiselle Théroigne, with pike and helmet, sits there as
 gunneress, “with haughty eye and serene fair countenance;”
 comparable, some think, to the _Maid_ of Orléans, or even
 recalling “the idea of Pallas Athene.”[235] Maillard (for his
 drum still rolls) is, by heaven-rending acclamation, admitted
 General. Maillard hastens the languid march. Maillard, beating
 rhythmic, with sharp ran-tan, all along the Quais, leads forward,
 with difficulty his Menadic host. Such a host—marched not in
 silence! The bargeman pauses on the River; all wagoners and
 coachdrivers fly; men peer from windows,—not women, lest they be
 pressed. Sight of sights: Bacchantes, in these ultimate
 Formalized Ages! Bronze Henri looks on, from his Pont-Neuf; the
 Monarchic Louvre, Medicean Tuileries see a day not theretofore
 seen. And now Maillard has his Menads in the _Champs Elysées_ (Fields
 _Tartarean_ rather); and the Hôtel-de-Ville has suffered
 comparatively nothing. Broken doors; an Abbé Lefevre, who shall
 never more distribute powder; three sacks of money, most part of
 which (for Sansculottism, though famishing, is not without
 honour) shall be returned:[236] this is all the damage. Great
 Maillard! A small nucleus of Order is round his drum; but his
 outskirts fluctuate like the mad Ocean: for Rascality male and
 female is flowing in on him, from the four winds; guidance there
 is none but in his single head and two drumsticks. O Maillard, when, since War first was, had General of Force such
 a task before him, as thou this day? Walter the Penniless still
 touches the feeling heart: but then Walter had sanction; had
 space to turn in; and also his Crusaders were of the male sex.
 Thou, this day, disowned of Heaven and Earth, art General of
 Menads. Their inarticulate frenzy thou must on the spur of the
 instant, render into articulate words, into actions that are not
 frantic. Fail in it, this way or that! Pragmatical Officiality,
 with its penalties and law-books, waits before thee; Menads storm
 behind. If such hewed off the melodious head of Orpheus, and
 hurled it into the Peneus waters, what may they not make of
 thee,—thee rhythmic merely, with no music but a sheepskin
 drum!—Maillard did not fail. Remarkable Maillard, if fame were
 not an accident, and History a distillation of Rumour, how
 remarkable wert thou! On the Elysian Fields, there is pause and fluctuation; but, for
 Maillard, no return. He persuades his Menads, clamorous for arms
 and the Arsenal, that no arms are in the Arsenal; that an unarmed
 attitude, and petition to a National Assembly, will be the best:
 he hastily nominates or sanctions generalesses, captains of tens
 and fifties;—and so, in loosest-flowing order, to the rhythm of
 some “eight drums” (having laid aside his own), with the Bastille
 Volunteers bringing up his rear, once more takes the road. Chaillot, which will promptly yield baked loaves, is not
 plundered; nor are the Sèvres Potteries broken. The old arches of
 Sèvres Bridge echo under Menadic feet; Seine River gushes on with
 his perpetual murmur; and Paris flings after us the boom of
 tocsin and alarm-drum,—inaudible, for the present, amid
 shrill-sounding hosts, and the splash of rainy weather. To
 Meudon, to Saint Cloud, on both hands, the report of them is gone
 abroad; and hearths, this evening, will have a topic. The press
 of women still continues, for it is the cause of all Eve’s
 Daughters, mothers that are, or that hope to be. No
 carriage-lady, were it with never such hysterics, but must
 dismount, in the mud roads, in her silk shoes, and walk.[237] In
 this manner, amid wild October weather, they a wild unwinged
 stork-flight, through the astonished country, wend their way.
 Travellers of all sorts they stop; especially travellers or
 couriers from Paris. Deputy Lechapelier, in his elegant vesture,
 from his elegant vehicle, looks forth amazed through his
 spectacles; apprehensive for life;—states eagerly that he is
 Patriot-Deputy Lechapelier, and even Old-President Lechapelier,
 who presided on the Night of Pentecost, and is original member of
 the Breton Club. Thereupon “rises huge shout of _Vive
 Lechapelier_, and several armed persons spring up behind and
 before to escort him.”[238] Nevertheless, news, despatches from Lafayette, or vague noise of
 rumour, have pierced through, by side roads. In the National
 Assembly, while all is busy discussing the order of the day;
 regretting that there should be Anti-national Repasts in
 Opera-Halls; that his Majesty should still hesitate about
 accepting the Rights of Man, and hang conditions and
 peradventures on them,—Mirabeau steps up to the President,
 experienced Mounier as it chanced to be; and articulates, in bass
 under-tone: ‘_Mounier, Paris marche sur nous_ (Paris is marching
 on us).’—‘May be (_Je n’en sais rien_)!’—‘Believe it or
 disbelieve it, that is not my concern; but Paris, I say, is
 marching on us. Fall suddenly unwell; go over to the Château;
 tell them this. There is not a moment to lose.’—‘Paris marching
 on us?’ responds Mounier, with an atrabiliar accent, ‘Well, so
 much the better! We shall the sooner be a Republic.’ Mirabeau
 quits him, as one quits an experienced President getting
 blindfold into deep waters; and the order of the day continues as
 before. Yes, Paris is marching on us; and more than the women of Paris!
 Scarcely was Maillard gone, when M. de Gouvion’s message to all
 the Districts, and such tocsin and drumming of the _générale_,
 began to take effect. Armed National Guards from every District;
 especially the Grenadiers of the Centre, who are our old Gardes
 Françaises, arrive, in quick sequence, on the Place de Grève. An
 “immense people” is there; Saint-Antoine, with pike and rusty
 firelock, is all crowding thither, be it welcome or unwelcome.
 The Centre Grenadiers are received with cheering: ‘it is not
 cheers that we want,’ answer they gloomily; ‘the nation has been
 insulted; to arms, and come with us for orders!’ Ha, sits the
 wind _so?_ Patriotism and Patrollotism are now one! The Three Hundred have assembled; “all the Committees are in
 activity;” Lafayette is dictating despatches for Versailles, when
 a Deputation of the Centre Grenadiers introduces itself to him.
 The Deputation makes military obeisance; and thus speaks, not
 without a kind of thought in it: ‘_Mon Général_, we are deputed
 by the Six Companies of Grenadiers. We do not think you a
 traitor, but we think the Government betrays you; it is time that
 this end. We cannot turn our bayonets against women crying to us
 for bread. The people are miserable, the source of the mischief
 is at Versailles: we must go seek the King, and bring him to
 Paris. We must exterminate (_exterminer_) the _Regiment de
 Flandre_ and the _Gardes-du-Corps_, who have dared to trample on
 the National Cockade. If the King be too weak to wear his crown,
 let him lay it down. You will crown his Son, you will name a
 Council of Regency; and all will go better.’[239] Reproachful
 astonishment paints itself on the face of Lafayette; speaks
 itself from his eloquent chivalrous lips: in vain. ‘My General,
 we would shed the last drop of our blood for you; but the root of
 the mischief is at Versailles; we must go and bring the King to
 Paris; all the people wish it, _tout le peuple le veut_.’ My General descends to the outer staircase; and harangues: once
 more in vain. ‘To Versailles! To Versailles!’ Mayor Bailly, sent
 for through floods of Sansculottism, attempts academic oratory
 from his gilt state-coach; realizes nothing but infinite hoarse
 cries of: ‘Bread! To Versailles!’—and gladly shrinks within
 doors. Lafayette mounts the white charger; and again harangues
 and reharangues: with eloquence, with firmness, indignant
 demonstration; with all things but persuasion. ‘To Versailles! To
 Versailles!’ So lasts it, hour after hour; for the space of half
 a day. The great Scipio Americanus can do nothing; not so much as
 escape. ‘_Morbleu, mon Général_,’ cry the Grenadiers serrying
 their ranks as the white charger makes a motion that way, ‘You
 will not leave us, you will abide with us!’ A perilous juncture:
 Mayor Bailly and the Municipals sit quaking within doors; My
 General is prisoner without: the Place de Grève, with its thirty
 thousand Regulars, its whole irregular Saint-Antoine and
 Saint-Marceau, is one minatory mass of clear or rusty steel; all
 hearts set, with a moody fixedness, on one object. Moody, fixed
 are all hearts: tranquil is no heart,—if it be not that of the
 white charger, who paws there, with arched neck, composedly
 champing his bit; as if no world, with its Dynasties and Eras,
 were now rushing down. The drizzly day tends westward; the cry is
 still: ‘To Versailles!’ Nay now, borne from afar, come quite sinister cries; hoarse,
 reverberating in longdrawn hollow murmurs, with syllables too
 like those of _Lanterne!_ Or else, irregular Sansculottism may be
 marching off, of itself; with pikes, nay with cannon. The
 inflexible Scipio does at length, by aide-de-camp, ask of the
 Municipals: Whether or not he may go? A Letter is handed out to
 him, over armed heads; sixty thousand faces flash fixedly on his,
 there is stillness and no bosom breathes, till he have read. By
 Heaven, he grows suddenly pale! Do the Municipals permit? “Permit
 and even order,”—since he can no other. Clangour of approval
 rends the welkin. To your ranks, then; let us march! It is, as we compute, towards three in the afternoon. Indignant
 National Guards may dine for once from their haversack: dined or
 undined, they march with one heart. Paris flings up her windows,
 claps hands, as the Avengers, with their shrilling drums and
 shalms tramp by; she will then sit pensive, apprehensive, and
 pass rather a sleepless night.[240] On the white charger,
 Lafayette, in the slowest possible manner, going and coming, and
 eloquently haranguing among the ranks, rolls onward with his
 thirty thousand. Saint-Antoine, with pike and cannon, has
 preceded him; a mixed multitude, of all and of no arms, hovers on
 his flanks and skirts; the country once more pauses agape: _Paris
 marche sur nous_.
 Chapter 1.7.VI.
 To Versailles. For, indeed, about this same moment, Maillard has halted his
 draggled Menads on the last hill-top; and now Versailles, and the
 Château of Versailles, and far and wide the inheritance of
 Royalty opens to the wondering eye. From far on the right, over
 Marly and Saint-Germains-en-Laye; round towards Rambouillet, on
 the left: beautiful all; softly embosomed; as if in sadness, in
 the dim moist weather! And near before us is Versailles, New and
 Old; with that broad frondent _Avenue de Versailles_
 between,—stately-frondent, broad, three hundred feet as men
 reckon, with four Rows of Elms; and then the _Château de
 Versailles_, ending in royal Parks and Pleasances, gleaming
 lakelets, arbours, Labyrinths, the _Ménagerie_, and Great and
 Little Trianon. High-towered dwellings, leafy pleasant places;
 where the gods of this lower world abide: whence, nevertheless,
 black Care cannot be excluded; whither Menadic Hunger is even now
 advancing, armed with pike-thyrsi! Yes, yonder, Mesdames, where our straight frondent Avenue,
 joined, as you note, by Two frondent brother Avenues from this
 hand and from that, spreads out into Place Royale and Palace
 Forecourt; yonder is the _Salle des Menus_. Yonder an august
 Assembly sits regenerating France. Forecourt, Grand Court, Court
 of Marble, Court narrowing into Court you may discern next, or
 fancy: on the extreme verge of which that glass-dome, visibly
 glittering like a star of hope, is the—Œil-de-Bœuf! Yonder, or
 nowhere in the world, is bread baked for us. But, O Mesdames,
 were not one thing good: That our cannons, with Demoiselle
 Théroigne and all show of war, be put to the rear? Submission
 beseems petitioners of a National Assembly; we are strangers in
 Versailles,—whence, too audibly, there comes even now sound as of
 tocsin and _générale!_ Also to put on, if possible, a cheerful
 countenance, hiding our sorrows; and even to sing? Sorrow, pitied
 of the Heavens, is hateful, suspicious to the Earth.—So counsels
 shifty Maillard; haranguing his Menads, on the heights near
 Versailles.[241] Cunning Maillard’s dispositions are obeyed. The draggled
 Insurrectionists advance up the Avenue, “in three columns”, among
 the four Elm-rows; “singing _Henri Quatre_,” with what melody
 they can; and shouting _Vive le Roi_. Versailles, though the
 Elm-rows are dripping wet, crowds from both sides, with: ‘_Vivent
 nos Parisiennes_, Our Paris ones for ever!’ Prickers, scouts have been out towards Paris, as the rumour
 deepened: whereby his Majesty, gone to shoot in the Woods of
 Meudon, has been happily discovered, and got home; and the
 _générale_ and tocsin set a-sounding. The Bodyguards are already
 drawn up in front of the Palace Grates; and look down the Avenue
 de Versailles; sulky, in wet buckskins. Flandre too is there,
 repentant of the Opera-Repast. Also Dragoons dismounted are
 there. Finally Major Lecointre, and what he can gather of the
 Versailles National Guard; though, it is to be observed, our
 Colonel, that same sleepless Count d’Estaing, giving neither
 order nor ammunition, has vanished most improperly; one supposes,
 into the Œil-de-Bœuf. Red-coated Swiss stand within the Grates,
 under arms. There likewise, in their inner room, “all the
 Ministers,” Saint-Priest, Lamentation Pompignan and the rest, are
 assembled with M. Necker: they sit with him there; blank,
 expecting what the hour will bring. President Mounier, though he answered Mirabeau with a _tant
 mieux_, and affected to slight the matter, had his own
 forebodings. Surely, for these four weary hours, he has reclined
 not on roses! The order of the day is getting forward: a
 Deputation to his Majesty seems proper, that it might please him
 to grant “Acceptance pure and simple” to those
 Constitution-Articles of ours; the “mixed qualified Acceptance,”
 with its peradventures, is satisfactory to neither gods nor men. So much is clear. And yet there is more, which no man speaks,
 which all men now vaguely understand. Disquietude, absence of
 mind is on every face; Members whisper, uneasily come and go: the
 order of the day is evidently not the day’s want. Till at length,
 from the outer gates, is heard a rustling and justling, shrill
 uproar and squabbling, muffled by walls; which testifies that the
 hour is come! Rushing and crushing one hears now; then enter
 Usher Maillard, with a Deputation of Fifteen muddy dripping
 Women,—having by incredible industry, and aid of all the macers,
 persuaded the rest to wait out of doors. National Assembly shall
 now, therefore, look its august task directly in the face:
 regenerative Constitutionalism has an unregenerate Sansculottism
 bodily in front of it; crying, ‘Bread! Bread!’ Shifty Maillard, translating frenzy into articulation; repressive
 with the one hand, expostulative with the other, does his best;
 and really, though not bred to public speaking, manages rather
 well:—In the present dreadful rarity of grains, a Deputation of
 Female Citizens has, as the august Assembly can discern, come out
 from Paris to petition. Plots of Aristocrats are too evident in
 the matter; for example, one miller has been bribed “by a
 banknote of 200 livres” not to grind,—name unknown to the Usher,
 but fact provable, at least indubitable. Further, it seems, the
 National Cockade has been trampled on; also there are Black
 Cockades, or were. All which things will not an august National
 Assembly, the hope of France, take into its wise immediate
 consideration? And Menadic Hunger, impressible, crying ‘Black Cockades,’ crying
 ‘Bread, Bread,’ adds, after such fashion: ‘Will it not?—Yes,
 Messieurs, if a Deputation to his Majesty, for the “Acceptance
 pure and simple,” seemed proper,—how much more now, for “the
 afflicting situation of Paris;” for the calming of this
 effervescence!’ President Mounier, with a speedy Deputation,
 among whom we notice the respectable figure of Doctor Guillotin,
 gets himself forthwith on march. Vice-President shall continue
 the order of the day; Usher Maillard shall stay by him to repress
 the women. It is four o’clock, of the miserablest afternoon, when
 Mounier steps out. O experienced Mounier, what an afternoon; the last of thy
 political existence! Better had it been to “fall suddenly
 unwell,” while it was yet time. For, behold, the Esplanade, over
 all its spacious expanse, is covered with groups of squalid
 dripping Women; of lankhaired male Rascality, armed with axes,
 rusty pikes, old muskets, ironshod clubs (_batons ferrés_, which
 end in knives or sword-blades, a kind of extempore
 billhook);—looking nothing but hungry revolt. The rain pours:
 Gardes-du-Corps go caracoling through the groups “amid hisses;”
 irritating and agitating what is but dispersed here to reunite
 there. Innumerable squalid women beleaguer the President and Deputation;
 insist on going with him: has not his Majesty himself, looking
 from the window, sent out to ask, What we wanted? ‘Bread and
 speech with the King (_Du pain, et parler au Roi_),’ that was the
 answer. Twelve women are clamorously added to the Deputation; and
 march with it, across the Esplanade; through dissipated groups,
 caracoling Bodyguards, and the pouring rain. President Mounier, unexpectedly augmented by Twelve Women,
 copiously escorted by Hunger and Rascality, is himself mistaken
 for a group: himself and his Women are dispersed by caracolers;
 rally again with difficulty, among the mud.[242] Finally the
 Grates are opened: the Deputation gets access, with the Twelve
 Women too in it; of which latter, Five shall even see the face of
 his Majesty. Let wet Menadism, in the best spirits it can expect
 their return.
 Chapter 1.7.VII.
 At Versailles. But already Pallas Athene (in the shape of Demoiselle Théroigne)
 is busy with Flandre and the dismounted Dragoons. She, and such
 women as are fittest, go through the ranks; speak with an earnest
 jocosity; clasp rough troopers to their patriot bosom, crush down
 spontoons and musketoons with soft arms: can a man, that were
 worthy of the name of man, attack famishing patriot women? One reads that Théroigne had bags of money, which she distributed
 over Flandre:—furnished by whom? Alas, with money-bags one seldom
 sits on insurrectionary cannon. Calumnious Royalism! Théroigne
 had only the limited earnings of her profession of
 unfortunate-female; money she had not, but brown locks, the
 figure of a heathen Goddess, and an eloquent tongue and heart. Meanwhile, Saint-Antoine, in groups and troops, is continually
 arriving; wetted, sulky; with pikes and impromptu billhooks:
 driven thus far by popular fixed-idea. So many hirsute figures
 driven hither, in that manner: figures that have come to do they
 know not what; figures that have come to see it done!
 Distinguished among all figures, who is this, of gaunt stature,
 with leaden breastplate, though a small one;[243] bushy in red
 grizzled locks; nay, with long tile-beard? It is Jourdan, unjust
 dealer in mules; a dealer no longer, but a Painter’s Layfigure,
 playing truant this day. From the necessities of Art comes his
 long tile-beard; whence his leaden breastplate (unless indeed he
 were some Hawker licensed by leaden badge) may have come,—will
 perhaps remain for ever a Historical Problem. Another Saul among
 the people we discern: “_Père Adam_, Father Adam,” as the groups
 name him; to us better known as bull-voiced Marquis Saint-Huruge;
 hero of the _Veto;_ a man that has had losses, and deserved them.
 The tall Marquis, emitted some days ago from limbo, looks
 peripatetically on this scene, from under his umbrella, not
 without interest. All which persons and things, hurled together
 as we see; Pallas Athene, busy with Flandre; patriotic Versailles
 National Guards, short of ammunition, and deserted by d’Estaing
 their Colonel, and commanded by Lecointre their Major; then
 caracoling Bodyguards, sour, dispirited, with their buckskins
 wet; and finally this flowing sea of indignant Squalor,—may they
 not give rise to occurrences?');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Behold, however, the Twelve She-deputies return from the Château.
 Without President Mounier, indeed; but radiant with joy, shouting
 ‘_Life to the King and his House_.’ Apparently the news are good,
 Mesdames? News of the best! Five of us were admitted to the
 internal splendours, to the Royal Presence. This slim damsel,
 “Louison Chabray, worker in sculpture, aged only seventeen,” as
 being of the best looks and address, her we appointed speaker. On
 whom, and indeed on all of us, his Majesty looked nothing but
 graciousness. Nay, when Louison, addressing him, was like to
 faint, he took her in his royal arms; and said gallantly, ‘It was
 well worth while (_Elle en valût bien la peine_).’ Consider, O
 women, what a King! His words were of comfort, and that only:
 there shall be provision sent to Paris, if provision is in the
 world; grains shall circulate free as air; millers shall grind,
 or do worse, while their millstones endure; and nothing be left
 wrong which a Restorer of French Liberty can right. Good news these; but, to wet Menads, all too incredible! There
 seems no proof, then? _Words_ of comfort are words only; which
 will feed nothing. O miserable people, betrayed by Aristocrats,
 who corrupt thy very messengers! In his royal arms, Mademoiselle
 Louison? In his arms? Thou shameless minx, worthy of a name—that
 shall be nameless! Yes, thy skin is soft: ours is rough with
 hardship; and well wetted, waiting here in the rain. No children
 hast thou hungry at home; only alabaster dolls, that weep not!
 The traitress! To the Lanterne!—And so poor Louison Chabray, no
 asseveration or shrieks availing her, fair slim damsel, late in
 the arms of Royalty, has a garter round her neck, and furibund
 Amazons at each end; is about to perish so,—when two Bodyguards
 gallop up, indignantly dissipating; and rescue her. The
 miscredited Twelve hasten back to the Château, for an “answer in
 writing.” Nay, behold, a new flight of Menads, with “M. Brunout Bastille
 Volunteer,” as impressed-commandant, at the head of it. These
 also will advance to the Grate of the Grand Court, and see what
 is toward. Human patience, in wet buckskins, has its limits.
 Bodyguard Lieutenant, M. de Savonnières, for one moment, lets his
 temper, long provoked, long pent, give way. He not only
 dissipates these latter Menads; but caracoles and cuts, or
 indignantly flourishes, at M. Brunout, the impressed-commandant;
 and, finding great relief in it, even chases him; Brunout flying
 nimbly, though in a pirouette manner, and now with sword also
 drawn. At which sight of wrath and victory two other Bodyguards
 (for wrath is contagious, and to pent Bodyguards is so solacing)
 do likewise give way; give chase, with brandished sabre, and in
 the air make horrid circles. So that poor Brunout has nothing for
 it but to retreat with accelerated nimbleness, through rank after
 rank; Parthian-like, fencing as he flies; above all, shouting
 lustily, ‘_On nous laisse assassiner_, They are getting us
 assassinated?’ Shameful! Three against one! Growls come from the Lecointrian
 ranks; bellowings,—lastly shots. Savonnières” arm is raised to
 strike: the bullet of a Lecointrian musket shatters it; the
 brandished sabre jingles down harmless. Brunout has escaped, this
 duel well ended: but the wild howl of war is everywhere beginning
 to pipe! The Amazons recoil; Saint-Antoine has its cannon pointed (full of
 grapeshot); thrice applies the lit flambeau; which thrice refuses
 to catch,—the touchholes are so wetted; and voices cry:
 ‘_Arrêtez, il n’est pas temps encore_, Stop, it is not yet
 time!’[244] Messieurs of the Garde-du-Corps, ye had orders not to
 fire; nevertheless two of you limp dismounted, and one war-horse
 lies slain. Were it not well to draw back out of shot-range;
 finally to file off,—into the interior? If in so filing off,
 there did a musketoon or two discharge itself, at these armed
 shopkeepers, hooting and crowing, could man wonder? Draggled are
 your white cockades of an enormous size; would to Heaven they
 were got exchanged for tricolor ones! Your buckskins are wet,
 your hearts heavy. Go, and return not! The Bodyguards file off, as we hint; giving and receiving shots;
 drawing no life-blood; leaving boundless indignation. Some three
 times in the thickening dusk, a glimpse of them is seen, at this
 or the other Portal: saluted always with execrations, with the
 whew of lead. Let but a Bodyguard shew face, he is hunted by
 Rascality;—for instance, poor “M. de Moucheton of the Scotch
 Company,” owner of the slain war-horse; and has to be smuggled
 off by Versailles Captains. Or rusty firelocks belch after him,
 shivering asunder his—hat. In the end, by superior Order, the
 Bodyguards, all but the few on immediate duty, disappear; or as
 it were abscond; and march, under cloud of night, to
 Rambouillet.[245] We remark also that the Versaillese have now got ammunition: all
 afternoon, the official Person could find none; till, in these so
 critical moments, a patriotic Sublieutenant set a pistol to his
 ear, and would thank him to find some,—which he thereupon
 succeeded in doing. Likewise that Flandre, disarmed by Pallas
 Athene, says openly, it will not fight with citizens; and for
 token of peace, has exchanged cartridges with the Versaillese. Sansculottism is now among mere friends; and can “circulate
 freely;” indignant at Bodyguards;—complaining also considerably
 of hunger.
 Chapter 1.7.VIII.
 The Equal Diet. But why lingers Mounier; returns not with his Deputation? It is
 six, it is seven o’clock; and still no Mounier, no Acceptance
 pure and simple. And, behold, the dripping Menads, not now in deputation but in
 mass, have penetrated into the Assembly: to the shamefullest
 interruption of public speaking and order of the day. Neither
 Maillard nor Vice-President can restrain them, except within wide
 limits; not even, except for minutes, can the lion-voice of
 Mirabeau, though they applaud it: but ever and anon they break in
 upon the regeneration of France with cries of: ‘Bread; not so
 much discoursing! _Du pain; pas tant de longs discours!_’—So
 insensible were these poor creatures to bursts of Parliamentary
 eloquence! One learns also that the royal Carriages are getting yoked, as if
 for Metz. Carriages, royal or not, have verily showed themselves
 at the back Gates. They even produced, or quoted, a written order
 from our Versailles Municipality,—which is a Monarchic not a
 Democratic one. However, Versailles Patroles drove them in again;
 as the vigilant Lecointre had strictly charged them to do. A busy man, truly, is Major Lecointre, in these hours. For
 Colonel d’Estaing loiters invisible in the Œil-de-Bœuf;
 invisible, or still more questionably _visible_, for instants:
 then also a too loyal Municipality requires supervision: no
 order, civil or military, taken about any of these thousand
 things! Lecointre is at the Versailles Townhall: he is at the
 Grate of the Grand Court; communing with Swiss and Bodyguards. He
 is in the ranks of Flandre; he is here, he is there: studious to
 prevent bloodshed; to prevent the Royal Family from flying to
 Metz; the Menads from plundering Versailles. At the fall of night, we behold him advance to those armed groups
 of Saint-Antoine, hovering all-too grim near the Salle des Menus.
 They receive him in a half-circle; twelve speakers behind
 cannons, with lighted torches in hand, the cannon-mouths
 _towards_ Lecointre: a picture for Salvator! He asks, in
 temperate but courageous language: What they, by this their
 journey to Versailles, do specially want? The twelve speakers
 reply, in few words inclusive of much: ‘Bread, and the end of
 these brabbles, _Du pain, et la fin des affaires_.’ When the
 _affairs_ will end, no Major Lecointre, nor no mortal, can say;
 but as to bread, he inquires, How many are you?—learns that they
 are six hundred, that a loaf each will suffice; and rides off to
 the Municipality to get six hundred loaves. Which loaves, however, a Municipality of Monarchic temper will
 not give. It will give two tons of rice rather,—could you but
 know whether it should be boiled or raw. Nay when this too is
 accepted, the Municipals have disappeared;—ducked under, as the
 Six-and-Twenty Long-gowned of Paris did; and, leaving not the
 smallest vestage of rice, in the boiled or raw state, they there
 vanish from History! Rice comes not; one’s hope of food is baulked; even one’s hope of
 vengeance: is not M. de Moucheton of the Scotch Company, as we
 said, deceitfully smuggled off? Failing all which, behold only M.
 de Moucheton’s slain warhorse, lying on the Esplanade there!
 Saint-Antoine, baulked, esurient, pounces on the slain warhorse;
 flays it; roasts it, with such fuel, of paling, gates, portable
 timber as can be come at,—not without shouting: and, after the
 manner of ancient Greek Heroes, _they lifted their hands to the
 daintily readied repast;_ such as it might be.[246] Other
 Rascality prowls discursive; seeking what it may devour. Flandre
 will retire to its barracks; Lecointre also with his
 Versaillese,—all but the vigilant Patrols, charged to be doubly
 vigilant. So sink the shadows of Night, blustering, rainy; and all paths
 grow dark. Strangest Night ever seen in these regions,—perhaps
 since the Bartholomew Night, when Versailles, as Bassompierre
 writes of it, was a _chétif château_. O for the Lyre of some
 Orpheus, to constrain, with touch of melodious strings, these mad
 masses into Order! For here all seems fallen asunder, in
 wide-yawning dislocation. The highest, as in down-rushing of a
 World, is come in contact with the lowest: the Rascality of
 France beleaguering the Royalty of France; “ironshod batons”
 lifted round the diadem, not to guard it! With denunciations of
 bloodthirsty Anti-national Bodyguards, are heard dark growlings
 against a Queenly Name. The Court sits tremulous, powerless; varies with the varying
 temper of the Esplanade, with the varying colour of the rumours
 from Paris. Thick-coming rumours; now of peace, now of war.
 Necker and all the Ministers consult; with a blank issue. The
 Œil-de-Bœuf is one tempest of whispers:—We will fly to Metz; we
 will not fly. The royal Carriages again attempt egress;—though
 for trial merely; they are again driven in by Lecointre’s
 Patrols. In six hours, nothing has been resolved on; not even the
 Acceptance pure and simple. In six hours? Alas, he who, in such circumstances, cannot resolve
 in six minutes, may give up the enterprise: him Fate has already
 resolved for. And Menadism, meanwhile, and Sansculottism takes
 counsel with the National Assembly; grows more and more
 tumultuous there. Mounier returns not; Authority nowhere shews
 itself: the Authority of France lies, for the present, with
 Lecointre and Usher Maillard.—This then is the abomination of
 desolation; come suddenly, though long foreshadowed as
 inevitable! For, to the blind, all things are sudden. Misery
 which, through long ages, had no spokesman, no helper, will now
 be its own helper and speak for itself. The dialect, one of the
 rudest, is, what it could be, _this_. At eight o’clock there returns to our Assembly not the
 Deputation; but Doctor Guillotin announcing that it will return;
 also that there is hope of the Acceptance pure and simple. He
 himself has brought a Royal Letter, authorising and commanding
 the freest “circulation of grains.” Which Royal Letter Menadism
 with its whole heart applauds. Conformably to which the Assembly
 forthwith passes a Decree; also received with rapturous Menadic
 plaudits:—Only could not an august Assembly contrive further to
 ‘_fix_ the price of bread at eight sous the half-quartern;
 butchers’-meat at six sous the pound;’ which seem fair rates?
 Such motion do “a multitude of men and women,” irrepressible by
 Usher Maillard, now make; does an august Assembly hear made.
 Usher Maillard himself is not always perfectly measured in
 speech; but if rebuked, he can justly excuse himself by the
 peculiarity of the circumstances.[247] But finally, this Decree well passed, and the disorder
 continuing; and Members melting away, and no President Mounier
 returning,—what can the Vice-President do but also melt away? The
 Assembly melts, under such pressure, into deliquium; or, as it is
 officially called, adjourns. Maillard is despatched to Paris,
 with the “Decree concerning Grains” in his pocket; he and some
 women, in carriages belonging to the King. Thitherward slim
 Louison Chabray has already set forth, with that “written
 answer,” which the Twelve She-deputies returned in to seek. Slim
 sylph, she has set forth, through the black muddy country: she
 has much to tell, her poor nerves so flurried; and travels, as
 indeed today on this road all persons do, with extreme slowness.
 President Mounier has not come, nor the Acceptance pure and
 simple; though six hours with their events have come; though
 courier on courier reports that Lafayette is coming. Coming, with
 war or with peace? It is time that the Château also should
 determine on one thing or another; that the Château also should
 show itself alive, if it would continue living! Victorious, joyful after such delay, Mounier does arrive at last,
 and the hard-earned Acceptance with him; which now, alas, is of
 small value. Fancy Mounier’s surprise to find his Senate, whom he
 hoped to charm by the Acceptance pure and simple,—all gone; and
 in its stead a Senate of Menads! For as Erasmus’s Ape mimicked,
 say with wooden splint, Erasmus shaving, so do these Amazons
 hold, in mock majesty, some confused parody of National Assembly.
 They make motions; deliver speeches; pass enactments; productive
 at least of loud laughter. All galleries and benches are filled;
 a strong Dame of the Market is in Mounier’s Chair. Not without
 difficulty, Mounier, by aid of macers, and persuasive speaking,
 makes his way to the Female-President: the Strong Dame before
 abdicating signifies that, for one thing, she and indeed her
 whole senate male and female (for what was one roasted warhorse
 among so many?) are suffering very considerably from hunger. Experienced Mounier, in these circumstances, takes a twofold
 resolution: To reconvoke his Assembly Members by sound of drum;
 also to procure a supply of food. Swift messengers fly, to all
 bakers, cooks, pastrycooks, vintners, restorers; drums beat,
 accompanied with shrill vocal proclamation, through all streets.
 They come: the Assembly Members come; what is still better, the
 provisions come. On tray and barrow come these latter; loaves,
 wine, great store of sausages. The nourishing baskets circulate
 harmoniously along the benches; nor, according to the Father of
 Epics, _did any soul lack a fair share of victual_ (δαῖτος
 ὲἱσης), _an equal diet_); highly desirable, at the moment.[248] Gradually some hundred or so of Assembly members get edged in,
 Menadism making way a little, round Mounier’s Chair; listen to
 the Acceptance pure and simple; and begin, what is the order of
 the night, “discussion of the Penal Code.” All benches are
 crowded; in the dusky galleries, duskier with unwashed heads, is
 a strange “coruscation,”—of impromptu billhooks.[249] It is
 exactly five months this day since these same galleries were
 filled with high-plumed jewelled Beauty, raining bright
 influences; and now? To such length have we got in regenerating
 France. Methinks the travail-throes are of the sharpest!—Menadism
 will not be restrained from occasional remarks; asks, ‘What is
 use of the Penal Code? The thing we want is Bread.’ Mirabeau
 turns round with lion-voiced rebuke; Menadism applauds him; but
 recommences. Thus they, chewing tough sausages, discussing the Penal Code,
 make night hideous. What the issue will be? Lafayette with his
 thirty thousand must arrive first: him, who cannot now be
 distant, all men expect, as the messenger of Destiny.
 Chapter 1.7.IX.
 Lafayette. Towards midnight lights flare on the hill; Lafayette’s lights!
 The roll of his drums comes up the Avenue de Versailles. With
 peace, or with war? Patience, friends! With neither. Lafayette is
 come, but not yet the catastrophe. He has halted and harangued so often, on the march; spent nine
 hours on four leagues of road. At Montreuil, close on Versailles,
 the whole Host had to pause; and, with uplifted right hand, in
 the murk of Night, to these pouring skies, swear solemnly to
 respect the King’s Dwelling; to be faithful to King and National
 Assembly. Rage is driven down out of sight, by the laggard march;
 the thirst of vengeance slaked in weariness and soaking clothes.
 Flandre is again drawn out under arms: but Flandre, grown so
 patriotic, now needs no “exterminating.” The wayworn Batallions
 halt in the Avenue: they have, for the present, no wish so
 pressing as that of shelter and rest. Anxious sits President Mounier; anxious the Château. There is a
 message coming from the Château, that M. Mounier would please
 return thither with a fresh Deputation, swiftly; and so at least
 _unite_ our two anxieties. Anxious Mounier does of himself send,
 meanwhile, to apprise the General that his Majesty has been so
 gracious as to grant us the Acceptance pure and simple. The
 General, with a small advance column, makes answer in passing;
 speaks vaguely some smooth words to the National
 President,—glances, only with the eye, at that so mixtiform
 National Assembly; then fares forward towards the Château. There
 are with him two Paris Municipals; they were chosen from the
 Three Hundred for that errand. He gets admittance through the
 locked and padlocked Grates, through sentries and ushers, to the
 Royal Halls. The Court, male and female, crowds on his passage, to read their
 doom on his face; which exhibits, say Historians, a mixture “of
 sorrow, of fervour and valour,” singular to behold.[250] The
 King, with Monsieur, with Ministers and Marshals, is waiting to
 receive him: He ‘is come,’ in his highflown chivalrous way, ‘to
 offer his head for the safety of his Majesty’s.’ The two
 Municipals state the wish of Paris: four things, of quite pacific
 tenor. First, that the honour of Guarding his sacred person be
 conferred on patriot National Guards;—say, the Centre Grenadiers,
 who as Gardes Françaises were wont to have that privilege.
 Second, that provisions be got, if possible. Third, that the
 Prisons, all crowded with political delinquents, may have judges
 sent them. Fourth, _that it would please his Majesty to come and
 live in Paris._ To all which four wishes, except the fourth, his
 Majesty answers readily, Yes; or indeed may almost say that he
 has already answered it. To the fourth he can answer only, Yes or
 No; would so gladly answer, Yes _and_ No!—But, in any case, are
 not their dispositions, thank Heaven, so entirely pacific? There
 is time for deliberation. The brunt of the danger seems past! Lafayette and d’Estaing settle the watches; Centre Grenadiers are
 to take the Guard-room they of old occupied as Gardes
 Françaises;—for indeed the Gardes du Corps, its late ill-advised
 occupants, are gone mostly to Rambouillet. That is the order of
 _this_ night; sufficient for the night is the evil thereof.
 Whereupon Lafayette and the two Municipals, with highflown
 chivalry, take their leave. So brief has the interview been, Mounier and his Deputation were
 not yet got up. So brief and satisfactory. A stone is rolled from
 every heart. The fair Palace Dames publicly declare that this
 Lafayette, detestable though he be, is their saviour for once.
 Even the ancient vinaigrous _Tantes_ admit it; the King’s Aunts,
 ancient _Graille_ and Sisterhood, known to us of old. Queen
 Marie-Antoinette has been heard often say the like. She alone,
 among all women and all men, wore a face of courage, of lofty
 calmness and resolve, this day. She alone saw clearly what she
 _meant_ to do; and Theresa’s Daughter _dares_ do what she means,
 were all France threatening her: abide where her children are,
 where her husband is. Towards three in the morning all things are settled: the watches
 set, the Centre Grenadiers put into their old Guard-room, and
 harangued; the Swiss, and few remaining Bodyguards harangued. The
 wayworn Paris Batallions, consigned to “the hospitality of
 Versailles,” lie dormant in spare-beds, spare-barracks,
 coffeehouses, empty churches. A troop of them, on their way to
 the Church of Saint-Louis, awoke poor Weber, dreaming troublous,
 in the Rue Sartory. Weber has had his waistcoat-pocket full of
 balls all day; “two hundred balls, and two _pears_ of powder!”
 For waistcoats were waistcoats then, and had flaps down to
 mid-thigh. So many balls he has had all day; but no opportunity
 of using them: he turns over now, execrating disloyal bandits;
 swears a prayer or two, and straight to sleep again. Finally, the National Assembly is harangued; which thereupon, on
 motion of Mirabeau, discontinues the Penal Code, and dismisses
 for this night. Menadism, Sansculottism has cowered into
 guard-houses, barracks of Flandre, to the light of cheerful fire;
 failing that, to churches, office-houses, sentry-boxes,
 wheresoever wretchedness can find a lair. The troublous Day has
 brawled itself to rest: no lives yet lost but that of one
 warhorse. Insurrectionary Chaos lies slumbering round the Palace,
 like Ocean round a Diving-bell,—no crevice yet disclosing itself. Deep sleep has fallen promiscuously on the high and on the low;
 suspending most things, even wrath and famine. Darkness covers
 the Earth. But, far on the North-east, Paris flings up her great
 yellow gleam; far into the wet black Night. For all is
 illuminated there, as in the old July Nights; the streets
 deserted, for alarm of war; the Municipals all wakeful; Patrols
 hailing, with their hoarse _Who-goes_. There, as we discover, our
 poor slim Louison Chabray, her poor nerves all fluttered, is
 arriving about this very hour. There Usher Maillard will arrive,
 about an hour hence, “towards four in the morning.” They report,
 successively, to a wakeful Hôtel-de-Ville what comfort they can
 report; which again, with early dawn, large comfortable Placards,
 shall impart to all men. Lafayette, in the Hôtel de Noailles, not far from the Château,
 having now finished haranguing, sits with his Officers
 consulting: at five o’clock the unanimous best counsel is, that a
 man so tost and toiled for twenty-four hours and more, fling
 himself on a bed, and seek some rest. Thus, then, has ended the First Act of the Insurrection of Women.
 How it will turn on the morrow? The morrow, as always, is with
 the Fates! But his Majesty, one may hope, will consent to come
 honourably to Paris; at all events, he can visit Paris.
 Anti-national Bodyguards, here and elsewhere, must take the
 National Oath; make reparation to the Tricolor; Flandre will
 swear. There may be much swearing; much public speaking there
 will infallibly be: and so, with harangues and vows, may the
 matter in some handsome way, wind itself up. Or, alas, may it not be all otherwise, unhandsome: the consent
 not honourable, but extorted, ignominious? Boundless Chaos of
 Insurrection presses slumbering round the Palace, like Ocean
 round a Diving-bell; and may penetrate at any crevice. Let but
 that accumulated insurrectionary mass find entrance! Like the
 infinite inburst of water; or say rather, of inflammable,
 self-igniting fluid; for example, “turpentine-and-phosphorus
 oil,”—fluid known to Spinola Santerre!
 Chapter 1.7.X.
 The Grand Entries. The dull dawn of a new morning, drizzly and chill, had but broken
 over Versailles, when it pleased Destiny that a Bodyguard should
 look out of window, on the right wing of the Château, to see what
 prospect there was in Heaven and in Earth. Rascality male and
 female is prowling in view of him. His fasting stomach is, with
 good cause, sour; he perhaps cannot forbear a passing malison on
 them; least of all can he forbear answering such. Ill words breed worse: till the worst word came; and then the ill
 deed. Did the maledicent Bodyguard, getting (as was too
 inevitable) better malediction than he gave, load his musketoon,
 and threaten to fire; and actually fire? Were wise who wist! It
 stands asserted; to us not credibly. Be this as it may, menaced
 Rascality, in whinnying scorn, is shaking at all Grates: the
 fastening of one (some write, it was a chain merely) gives way;
 Rascality is in the Grand Court, whinnying louder still. The maledicent Bodyguard, more Bodyguards than he do now give
 fire; a man’s arm is shattered. Lecointre will depose[251] that
 “the Sieur Cardaine, a National Guard without arms, was stabbed.”
 But see, sure enough, poor Jerôme l’Héritier, an unarmed National
 Guard he too, “cabinet-maker, a saddler’s son, of Paris,” with
 the down of youthhood still on his chin,—he reels death-stricken;
 rushes to the pavement, scattering it with his blood and
 brains!—Allelew! Wilder than Irish wakes, rises the howl: of
 pity; of infinite revenge. In few moments, the Grate of the inner
 and inmost Court, which they name Court of Marble, this too is
 forced, or surprised, and burst open: the Court of Marble too is
 overflowed: up the Grand Staircase, up all stairs and entrances
 rushes the living Deluge! Deshuttes and Varigny, the two sentry
 Bodyguards, are trodden down, are massacred with a hundred pikes.
 Women snatch their cutlasses, or any weapon, and storm-in
 Menadic:—other women lift the corpse of shot Jerôme; lay it down
 on the Marble steps; there shall the livid face and smashed head,
 dumb for ever, _speak_. Wo now to all Bodyguards, mercy is none for them! Miomandre de
 Sainte-Marie pleads with soft words, on the Grand Staircase,
 “descending four steps:”—to the roaring tornado. His comrades
 snatch him up, by the skirts and belts; literally, from the jaws
 of Destruction; and slam-to their Door. This also will stand few
 instants; the panels shivering in, like potsherds. Barricading
 serves not: fly fast, ye Bodyguards; rabid Insurrection, like the
 hellhound Chase, uproaring at your heels! The terrorstruck Bodyguards fly, bolting and barricading; it
 follows. Whitherward? Through hall on hall: wo, now! towards the
 Queen’s Suite of Rooms, in the furtherest room of which the Queen
 is now asleep. Five sentinels rush through that long Suite; they
 are in the Anteroom knocking loud: ‘Save the Queen!’ Trembling
 women fall at their feet with tears; are answered: ‘Yes, we will
 die; save ye the Queen!’ Tremble not, women, but haste: for, lo, another voice shouts far
 through the outermost door, ‘Save the Queen!’ and the door shut.
 It is brave Miomandre’s voice that shouts this second warning. He
 has stormed across imminent death to do it; fronts imminent
 death, having done it. Brave Tardivet du Repaire, bent on the
 same desperate service, was borne down with pikes; his comrades
 hardly snatched him in again alive. Miomandre and Tardivet: let
 the names of these two Bodyguards, as the names of brave men
 should, live long. Trembling Maids of Honour, one of whom from afar caught glimpse
 of Miomandre as well as heard him, hastily wrap the Queen; not in
 robes of State. She flies for her life, across the Œil-de-Bœuf;
 against the main door of which too Insurrection batters. She is
 in the King’s Apartment, in the King’s arms; she clasps her
 children amid a faithful few. The Imperial-hearted bursts into
 mother’s tears: ‘O my friends, save me and my children, _O mes
 amis, sauvez moi et mes enfans!_’ The battering of
 Insurrectionary axes clangs audible across the Œil-de-Bœuf. What
 an hour! Yes, Friends: a hideous fearful hour; shameful alike to Governed
 and Governor; wherein Governed and Governor ignominiously testify
 that their relation is at an end. Rage, which had brewed itself
 in twenty thousand hearts, for the last four-and-twenty hours,
 has taken fire: Jerome’s brained corpse lies there as live-coal.
 It is, as we said, the infinite Element bursting in: wild-surging
 through all corridors and conduits. Meanwhile, the poor Bodyguards have got hunted mostly into the
 Œil-de-Bœuf. They may die there, at the King’s threshhold; they
 can do little to defend it. They are heaping _tabourets_ (stools
 of honour), benches and all moveables, against the door; at which
 the axe of Insurrection thunders.—But did brave Miomandre perish,
 then, at the Queen’s door? No, he was fractured, slashed,
 lacerated, left for dead; he has nevertheless crawled hither; and
 shall live, honoured of loyal France. Remark also, in flat
 contradiction to much which has been said and sung, that
 Insurrection did _not_ burst that door he had defended; but
 hurried elsewhither, seeking new bodyguards.[252] Poor Bodyguards, with their Thyestes’ Opera-Repast! Well for
 them, that Insurrection has only pikes and axes; no right sieging
 tools! It shakes and thunders. Must they all perish miserably,
 and Royalty with them? Deshuttes and Varigny, massacred at the
 first inbreak, have been beheaded in the Marble Court: a
 sacrifice to Jerôme’s _manes:_ Jourdan with the tile-beard did
 that duty willingly; and asked, If there were no more? Another
 captive they are leading round the corpse, with howl-chauntings:
 may not Jourdan again tuck up his sleeves? And louder and louder rages Insurrection within, plundering if it
 cannot kill; louder and louder it thunders at the Œil-de-Bœuf:
 what can now hinder its bursting in?—On a sudden it ceases; the
 battering has ceased! Wild rushing: the cries grow fainter: there
 is silence, or the tramp of regular steps; then a friendly
 knocking: ‘We are the Centre Grenadiers, old Gardes Françaises:
 Open to us, Messieurs of the Garde-du-Corps; we have not
 forgotten how you saved us at Fontenoy!’[253] The door is opened;
 enter Captain Gondran and the Centre Grenadiers: there are
 military embracings; there is sudden deliverance from death into
 life. Strange Sons of Adam! It was to “exterminate” these
 Gardes-du-Corps that the Centre Grenadiers left home: and now
 they have rushed to save them from extermination. The memory of
 common peril, of old help, melts the rough heart; bosom is
 clasped to bosom, not in war. The King shews himself, one moment,
 through the door of his Apartment, with: ‘Do not hurt my
 Guards!’—‘_Soyons frères_, Let us be brothers!’ cries Captain
 Gondran; and again dashes off, with levelled bayonets, to sweep
 the Palace clear. Now too Lafayette, suddenly roused, not from sleep (for his eyes
 had not yet closed), arrives; with passionate popular eloquence,
 with prompt military word of command. National Guards, suddenly
 roused, by sound of trumpet and alarm-drum, are all arriving. The
 death-melly ceases: the first sky-lambent blaze of Insurrection
 is got damped down; it burns now, if unextinguished, yet
 flameless, as charred coals do, and not inextinguishable. The
 King’s Apartments are safe. Ministers, Officials, and even some
 loyal National deputies are assembling round their Majesties. The
 consternation will, with sobs and confusion, settle down
 gradually, into plan and counsel, better or worse.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' But glance now, for a moment, from the royal windows! A roaring
 sea of human heads, inundating both Courts; billowing against all
 passages: Menadic women; infuriated men, mad with revenge, with
 love of mischief, love of plunder! Rascality has slipped its
 muzzle; and now bays, three-throated, like the Dog of Erebus.
 Fourteen Bodyguards are wounded; two massacred, and as we saw,
 beheaded; Jourdan asking, ‘Was it worth while to come so far for
 two?’ Hapless Deshuttes and Varigny! Their fate surely was sad.
 Whirled down so suddenly to the abyss; as men are, suddenly, by
 the wide thunder of the Mountain Avalanche, awakened not by
 _them_, awakened far off by others! When the Château Clock last
 struck, they two were pacing languid, with poised musketoon;
 anxious mainly that the next hour would strike. It has struck; to
 them inaudible. Their trunks lie mangled: their heads parade, “on
 pikes twelve feet long,” through the streets of Versailles; and
 shall, about noon reach the Barriers of Paris,—a too ghastly
 contradiction to the large comfortable Placards that have been
 posted there! The other captive Bodyguard is still circling the corpse of
 Jerome, amid Indian war-whooping; bloody Tilebeard, with tucked
 sleeves, brandishing his bloody axe; when Gondran and the
 Grenadiers come in sight. ‘Comrades, will you see a man massacred
 in cold blood?’—‘Off, butchers!’ answer they; and the poor
 Bodyguard is free. Busy runs Gondran, busy run Guards and
 Captains; scouring at all corridors; dispersing Rascality and
 Robbery; sweeping the Palace clear. The mangled carnage is
 removed; Jerome’s body to the Townhall, for inquest: the fire of
 Insurrection gets damped, more and more, into measurable,
 manageable heat. Transcendent things of all sorts, as in the general outburst of
 multitudinous Passion, are huddled together; the ludicrous, nay
 the ridiculous, with the horrible. Far over the billowy sea of
 heads, may be seen Rascality, caprioling on horses from the Royal
 Stud. The Spoilers these; for Patriotism is always infected so,
 with a proportion of mere thieves and scoundrels. Gondran
 snatched their prey from them in the Château; whereupon they
 hurried to the Stables, and took horse there. But the generous
 Diomedes’ steeds, according to Weber, disdained such
 scoundrel-burden; and, flinging up their royal heels, did soon
 project most of it, in parabolic curves, to a distance, amid
 peals of laughter: and were caught. Mounted National Guards
 secured the rest. Now too is witnessed the touching last-flicker of Etiquette;
 which sinks not here, in the Cimmerian World-wreckage, without a
 sign, as the house-cricket might still chirp in the pealing of a
 Trump of Doom. ‘Monsieur,’ said some Master of Ceremonies (one
 hopes it might be de Brézé), as Lafayette, in these fearful
 moments, was rushing towards the inner Royal Apartments,
 ‘_Monsieur, le Roi vous accorde les grandes entrées_, Monsieur,
 the King grants you the Grand Entries,’—not finding it convenient
 to refuse them![254]
 Chapter 1.7.XI.
 From Versailles. However, the Paris National Guard, wholly under arms, has cleared
 the Palace, and even occupies the nearer external spaces;
 extruding miscellaneous Patriotism, for most part, into the Grand
 Court, or even into the Forecourt. The Bodyguards, you can observe, have now of a verity, “hoisted
 the National Cockade:” for they step forward to the windows or
 balconies, hat aloft in hand, on each hat a huge tricolor; and
 fling over their bandoleers in sign of surrender; and shout _Vive
 la Nation_. To which how can the generous heart respond but with,
 _Vive le Roi; vivent les Gardes-du-Corps?_ His Majesty himself
 has appeared with Lafayette on the balcony, and again appears:
 _Vive le Roi_ greets him from all throats; but also from some one
 throat is heard ‘_Le Roi à Paris_, The King to Paris!’ Her Majesty too, on demand, shows herself, though there is peril
 in it: she steps out on the balcony, with her little boy and
 girl. ‘No children, _Point d’enfans!_’ cry the voices. She gently
 pushes back her children; and stands alone, her hands serenely
 crossed on her breast: ‘should I die,’ she had said, ‘I will do
 it.’ Such serenity of heroism has its effect. Lafayette, with
 ready wit, in his highflown chivalrous way, takes that fair
 queenly hand; and reverently kneeling, kisses it: thereupon the
 people do shout _Vive la Reine_. Nevertheless, poor Weber “saw”
 (or even thought he saw; for hardly the third part of poor
 Weber’s experiences, in such hysterical days, will stand
 scrutiny) “one of these brigands level his musket at her
 Majesty,”—with or without intention to shoot; for another of the
 brigands “angrily struck it down.” So that all, and the Queen herself, nay the very Captain of the
 Bodyguards, have grown National! The very Captain of the
 Bodyguards steps out now with Lafayette. On the hat of the
 repentant man is an enormous tricolor; large as a soup-platter,
 or sun-flower; visible to the utmost Forecourt. He takes the
 National Oath with a loud voice, elevating his hat; at which
 sight all the army raise their bonnets on their bayonets, with
 shouts. Sweet is reconcilement to the heart of man. Lafayette has
 sworn Flandre; he swears the remaining Bodyguards, down in the
 Marble Court; the people clasp them in their arms:—O, my
 brothers, why would ye force us to slay you? Behold there is joy
 over you, as over returning prodigal sons!—The poor Bodyguards,
 now National and tricolor, exchange bonnets, exchange arms; there
 shall be peace and fraternity. And still ‘_Vive le Roi;_’ and
 also ‘_Le Roi à Paris_,’ not now from one throat, but from all
 throats as one, for it is the heart’s wish of all mortals. Yes, _The King to Paris:_ what else? Ministers may consult, and
 National Deputies wag their heads: but there is now no other
 possibility. You have forced him to go willingly. ‘At one
 o’clock!’ Lafayette gives audible assurance to that purpose; and
 universal Insurrection, with immeasurable shout, and a discharge
 of all the firearms, clear and rusty, great and small, that it
 has, returns him acceptance. What a sound; heard for leagues: a
 doom peal!—That sound too rolls away, into the Silence of Ages.
 And the Château of Versailles stands ever since vacant, hushed
 still; its spacious Courts grassgrown, responsive to the hoe of
 the weeder. Times and generations roll on, in their confused
 Gulf-current; and buildings like builders have their destiny. Till one o’clock, then, there will be three parties, National
 Assembly, National Rascality, National Royalty, all busy enough.
 Rascality rejoices; women trim themselves with tricolor. Nay
 motherly Paris has sent her Avengers sufficient “cartloads of
 loaves;” which are shouted over, which are gratefully consumed.
 The Avengers, in return, are searching for grain-stores; loading
 them in fifty waggons; that so a National King, probable
 harbinger of all blessings, may be the evident bringer of plenty,
 for one. And thus has Sansculottism made prisoner its King; _revoking_ his
 parole. The Monarchy has fallen; and not so much as honourably:
 no, ignominiously; with struggle, indeed, oft repeated; but then
 with unwise struggle; wasting its strength in fits and paroxysms;
 at every new paroxysm, foiled more pitifully than before. Thus
 Broglie’s whiff of grapeshot, which might have been something,
 has dwindled to the pot-valour of an Opera Repast, and _O
 Richard, O mon Roi_. Which again we shall see dwindle to a
 Favras’ Conspiracy, a thing to be settled by the hanging of one
 Chevalier. Poor Monarchy! But what save foulest defeat can await that man,
 who wills, and yet wills not? Apparently the King either has a
 right, assertible as such to the death, before God and man; or
 else he has no right. Apparently, the one or the other; could he
 but know which! May Heaven pity him! Were Louis wise he would
 this day abdicate.—Is it not strange so few Kings abdicate; and
 none yet heard of has been known to commit suicide? Fritz the
 First, of Prussia, alone tried it; and they cut the rope.[255] As for the National Assembly, which decrees this morning that it
 “is inseparable from his Majesty,” and will follow him to Paris,
 there may one thing be noted: its extreme want of bodily health.
 After the Fourteenth of July there was a certain sickliness
 observable among honourable Members; so many demanding passports,
 on account of infirm health. But now, for these following days,
 there is a perfect murrian: President Mounier, Lally Tollendal,
 Clermont Tonnere, and all Constitutional Two-Chamber Royalists
 needing change of air; as most No-Chamber Royalists had formerly
 done. For, in truth, it is the _second Emigration_ this that has now
 come; most extensive among Commons Deputies, Noblesse, Clergy: so
 that “to Switzerland alone there go sixty thousand.” They will
 return in the day of accounts! Yes, and have hot welcome.—But
 Emigration on Emigration is the peculiarity of France. One
 Emigration follows another; grounded on reasonable fear,
 unreasonable hope, largely also on childish pet. The highflyers
 have gone first, now the lower flyers; and ever the lower will go
 down to the crawlers. Whereby, however, cannot our National
 Assembly so much the more commodiously make the Constitution;
 your Two-Chamber Anglomaniacs being all safe, distant on foreign
 shores? Abbé Maury is seized, and sent back again: he, tough as
 tanned leather, with eloquent Captain Cazalès and some others,
 will stand it out for another year. But here, meanwhile, the question arises: Was Philippe d’Orléans
 seen, this day, “in the Bois de Boulogne, in grey surtout;”
 waiting under the wet sere foliage, what the day might bring
 forth? Alas, yes, the Eidolon of him was,—in Weber’s and other
 such brains. The Chatelet shall make large inquisition into the
 matter, examining a hundred and seventy witnesses, and Deputy
 Chabroud publish his Report; but disclose nothing _farther_.[256]
 What then has caused these two unparalleled October Days? For
 surely such dramatic exhibition never yet enacted itself without
 Dramatist and Machinist. Wooden Punch emerges not, with his
 domestic sorrows, into the light of day, unless the wire be
 pulled: how can human mobs? Was it not d’Orléans then, and
 Laclos, Marquis Sillery, Mirabeau and the sons of confusion,
 hoping to drive the King to Metz, and gather the spoil? Nay was
 it not, quite contrariwise, the Œil-de-Bœuf, Bodyguard Colonel de
 Guiche, Minister Saint-Priest and highflying Loyalists; hoping
 also to drive him to Metz; and try it by the sword of civil war?
 Good Marquis Toulongeon, the Historian and Deputy, feels
 constrained to admit that it was _both_.[257] Alas, my Friends, credulous incredulity is a strange matter. But
 when a whole Nation is smitten with Suspicion, and sees a
 dramatic miracle in the very operation of the gastric juices,
 what help is there? Such Nation is already a mere hypochondriac
 bundle of diseases; as good as changed into glass; atrabiliar,
 decadent; and will suffer crises. Is not Suspicion itself the one
 thing to be suspected, as Montaigne feared only fear? Now, however, the short hour has struck. His Majesty is in his
 carriage, with his Queen, sister Elizabeth, and two royal
 children. Not for another hour can the infinite Procession get
 marshalled, and under way. The weather is dim drizzling; the mind
 confused; and noise great. Processional marches not a few our world has seen; Roman triumphs
 and ovations, Cabiric cymbal-beatings, Royal progresses, Irish
 funerals: but this of the French Monarchy marching to its bed
 remained to be seen. Miles long, and of breadth losing itself in
 vagueness, for all the neighbouring country crowds to see. Slow;
 stagnating along, like shoreless Lake, yet with a noise like
 Niagara, like Babel and Bedlam. A splashing and a tramping; a
 hurrahing, uproaring, musket-volleying;—the truest segment of
 Chaos seen in these latter Ages! Till slowly it disembogue
 itself, in the thickening dusk, into expectant Paris, through a
 double row of faces all the way from Passy to the Hôtel-de-Ville. Consider this: Vanguard of National troops; with trains of
 artillery; of pikemen and pikewomen, mounted on cannons, on
 carts, hackney-coaches, or on foot;—tripudiating, in tricolor
 ribbons from head to heel; loaves stuck on the points of
 bayonets, green boughs stuck in gun barrels.[258] Next, as
 main-march, “fifty cartloads of corn,” which have been lent, for
 peace, from the stores of Versailles. Behind which follow
 stragglers of the Garde-du-Corps; all humiliated, in Grenadier
 bonnets. Close on these comes the Royal Carriage; come Royal
 Carriages: for there are an Hundred National Deputies too, among
 whom sits Mirabeau,—his remarks not given. Then finally,
 pellmell, as rearguard, Flandre, Swiss, Hundred Swiss, other
 Bodyguards, Brigands, whosoever cannot get before. Between and
 among all which masses, flows without limit Saint-Antoine, and
 the Menadic Cohort. Menadic especially about the Royal Carriage;
 tripudiating there, covered with tricolor; singing “allusive
 songs;” pointing with one hand to the Royal Carriage, which the
 illusions hit, and pointing to the Provision-wagons, with the
 other hand, and these words: ‘Courage, Friends! We shall not want
 bread now; we are bringing you the Baker, the Bakeress, and
 Baker’s Boy (_le Boulanger, la Boulangère, et le petit
 Mitron_).’[259] The wet day draggles the tricolor, but the joy is
 unextinguishable. Is not all well now? ‘_Ah, Madame, notre bonne
 Reine_,’ said some of these Strong-women some days hence, ‘Ah
 Madame, our good Queen, don’t be a traitor any more (_ne soyez
 plus traître_), and we will all love you!’ Poor Weber went
 splashing along, close by the Royal carriage, with the tear in
 his eye: “their Majesties did me the honour,” or I thought they
 did it, “to testify, from time to time, by shrugging of the
 shoulders, by looks directed to Heaven, the emotions they felt.”
 Thus, like frail cockle, floats the Royal Life-boat, helmless, on
 black deluges of Rascality. Mercier, in his loose way, estimates the Procession and
 assistants at two hundred thousand. He says it was one boundless
 inarticulate Haha;—_transcendent_ World-Laughter; comparable to
 the Saturnalia of the Ancients. Why not? Here too, as we said, is
 Human Nature once more human; shudder at it whoso is of
 shuddering humour: yet behold it is human. It has “swallowed all
 formulas;” it tripudiates even so. For which reason they that
 collect Vases and Antiques, with figures of Dancing Bacchantes
 “in wild and all but impossible positions,” may look with some
 interest on it. Thus, however, has the slow-moving Chaos or modern Saturnalia of
 the Ancients, reached the Barrier; and must halt, to be harangued
 by Mayor Bailly. Thereafter it has to lumber along, between the
 double row of faces, in the transcendent heaven-lashing Haha; two
 hours longer, towards the Hôtel-de-Ville. Then again to be
 harangued there, by several persons; by Moreau de Saint-Méry,
 among others; Moreau of the Three-thousand orders, now National
 Deputy for St. Domingo. To all which poor Louis, who seemed to
 “experience a slight emotion” on entering this Townhall, can
 answer only that he ‘comes with pleasure, with confidence among
 his people.’ Mayor Bailly, in reporting it, forgets “confidence;”
 and the poor Queen says eagerly: ‘Add, with
 confidence.’—‘Messieurs,’ rejoins Bailly, ‘You are happier than
 if I had not forgot.’ Finally, the King is shewn on an upper balcony, by torchlight,
 with a huge tricolor in his hat: “And all the ‘people,’ says
 Weber, grasped one another’s hands;—thinking _now_ surely the New
 Era was born.” Hardly till eleven at night can Royalty get to its
 vacant, long-deserted Palace of the Tuileries: to lodge there,
 somewhat in strolling-player fashion. It is Tuesday, the sixth of
 October, 1789. Poor Louis has Two other Paris Processions to make: one
 ludicrous-ignominious like this; the other not ludicrous nor
 ignominious, but serious, nay sublime. END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.

 BOOK 2.I.
 THE FEAST OF PIKES
 Chapter 2.1.I.
 In the Tuileries. The victim having once got his stroke-of-grace, the catastrophe
 can be considered as almost come. There is small interest now in
 watching his long low moans: notable only are his sharper
 agonies, what convulsive struggles he may take to cast the
 torture off from him; and then finally the last departure of life
 itself, and how he lies extinct and ended, either wrapt like
 Cæsar in decorous mantle-folds, or unseemly sunk together, like
 one that had not the force even to die. Was French Royalty, when wrenched forth from its tapestries in
 that fashion, on that Sixth of October 1789, such a victim?
 Universal France, and Royal Proclamation to all the Provinces,
 answers anxiously, _No._ Nevertheless one may fear the worst.
 Royalty was beforehand so decrepit, moribund, there is little
 life in it to heal an injury. How much of its strength, which was
 of the imagination merely, has fled; Rascality having looked
 plainly in the King’s face, and not died! When the assembled
 crows can pluck up their scarecrow, and say to it, Here shalt
 thou stand and not there; and can treat with it, and make it,
 from an infinite, a quite finite Constitutional scarecrow,—what
 is to be looked for? Not in the finite Constitutional scarecrow,
 but in what still unmeasured, infinite-seeming force may rally
 round it, is there thenceforth any hope. For it is most true that
 all available Authority is _mystic_ in its conditions, and comes
 “by the grace of God.” Cheerfuller than watching the death-struggles of Royalism will it
 be to watch the growth and gambollings of Sansculottism; for, in
 human things, especially in human society, all death is but a
 death-birth: thus if the sceptre is departing from Louis, it is
 only that, in other forms, other sceptres, were it even
 pike-sceptres, may bear sway. In a prurient element, rich with
 nutritive influences, we shall find that Sansculottism grows
 lustily, and even frisks in not ungraceful sport: as indeed most
 young creatures are sportful; nay, may it not be noted further,
 that as the grown cat, and cat-species generally, is the
 cruellest thing known, so the merriest is precisely the kitten,
 or growing cat? But fancy the Royal Family risen from its truckle-beds on the
 morrow of that mad day: fancy the Municipal inquiry, ‘How would
 your Majesty please to lodge?’—and then that the King’s rough
 answer, ‘Each may lodge as he can, I am well enough,’ is congeed
 and bowed away, in expressive grins, by the Townhall
 Functionaries, with obsequious upholsterers at their back; and
 how the Château of the Tuileries is repainted, regarnished into a
 golden Royal Residence; and Lafayette with his blue National
 Guards lies encompassing it, as blue Neptune (in the language of
 poets) does an island, wooingly. Thither may the wrecks of
 rehabilitated Loyalty gather; if it will become Constitutional;
 for Constitutionalism thinks no evil; Sansculottism itself
 rejoices in the King’s countenance. The rubbish of a Menadic
 Insurrection, as in this ever-kindly world all rubbish can and
 must be, is swept aside; and so again, on clear arena, under new
 conditions, with something even of a new stateliness, we begin a
 new course of action. Arthur Young has witnessed the strangest scene: Majesty walking
 unattended in the Tuileries Gardens; and miscellaneous tricolor
 crowds, who cheer it, and reverently make way for it: the very
 Queen commands at lowest respectful silence, regretful
 avoidance.[260] Simple ducks, in those royal waters, quackle for
 crumbs from young royal fingers: the little Dauphin has a little
 railed garden, where he is seen delving, with ruddy cheeks and
 flaxen curled hair; also a little hutch to put his tools in, and
 screen himself against showers. What peaceable simplicity! Is it
 peace of a Father restored to his children? Or of a Taskmaster
 who has lost his whip? Lafayette and the Municipality and
 universal Constitutionalism assert the former, and do what is in
 them to realise it. Such Patriotism as snarls dangerously, and
 shows teeth, Patrollotism shall suppress; or far better, Royalty
 shall soothe down the angry hair of it, by gentle pattings; and,
 most effectual of all, by fuller diet. Yes, not only shall Paris
 be fed, but the King’s hand be seen in that work. The household
 goods of the Poor shall, up to a certain amount, by royal bounty,
 be disengaged from pawn, and that insatiable _Mont de Piété_
 disgorge: rides in the city with their _Vive-le-Roi_ need not
 fail; and so by substance and show, shall Royalty, if man’s art
 can popularise it, be popularised.[261] Or, alas, is it neither restored Father nor diswhipped Taskmaster
 that walks there; but an anomalous complex of both these, and of
 innumerable other heterogeneities; reducible to no rubric, if not
 to this newly devised one: _King Louis Restorer of French
 Liberty?_ Man indeed, and King Louis like other men, lives in
 this world to make rule out of the ruleless; by his living
 energy, he shall force the absurd itself to become less absurd.
 But then if there _be_ no living energy; living passivity only?
 King Serpent, hurled into his unexpected watery dominion, did at
 least bite, and assert credibly that he was there: but as for the
 poor King Log, tumbled hither and thither as thousandfold chance
 and other will than his might direct, how happy for him that he
 was indeed wooden; and, doing nothing, could also see and suffer
 nothing! It is a distracted business. For his French Majesty, meanwhile, one of the worst things is
 that he can get no hunting. Alas, no hunting henceforth; only a
 fatal being-hunted! Scarcely, in the next June weeks, shall he
 taste again the joys of the game-destroyer; in next June, and
 never more. He sends for his smith-tools; gives, in the course of
 the day, official or ceremonial business being ended, “a few
 strokes of the file, _quelques coups de lime._[262] Innocent
 brother mortal, why wert thou not an obscure substantial maker of
 locks; but doomed in that other far-seen craft, to be a maker
 only of world-follies, unrealities; things self destructive,
 which no mortal hammering could rivet into coherence! Poor Louis is not without insight, nor even without the elements
 of will; some sharpness of temper, spurting at times from a
 stagnating character. If harmless inertness could save him, it
 were well; but he will slumber and painfully dream, and to _do_
 aught is not given him. Royalist Antiquarians still shew the
 rooms where Majesty and suite, in these extraordinary
 circumstances, had their lodging. Here sat the Queen;
 reading,—for she had her library brought hither, though the King
 refused his; taking vehement counsel of the vehement
 uncounselled; sorrowing over altered times; yet with sure hope of
 better: in her young rosy Boy, has she not the living emblem of
 hope! It is a murky, working sky; yet with golden gleams—of dawn,
 or of deeper meteoric night? Here again this chamber, on the
 other side of the main entrance, was the King’s: here his Majesty
 breakfasted, and did official work; here daily after breakfast he
 received the Queen; sometimes in pathetic friendliness; sometimes
 in human sulkiness, for flesh is weak; and, when questioned about
 business would answer: ‘Madame, your business is with the
 children.’ Nay, Sire, were it not better you, your Majesty’s
 self, took the children? So asks impartial History; scornful that
 the _thicker_ vessel was not also the stronger; pity-struck for
 the porcelain-clay of humanity rather than for the
 tile-clay,—though indeed _both_ were broken! So, however, in this Medicean Tuileries, shall the French King
 and Queen now sit, for one-and-forty months; and see a
 wild-fermenting France work out its own destiny, and theirs.
 Months bleak, ungenial, of rapid vicissitude; yet with a mild
 pale splendour, here and there: as of an April that were leading
 to leafiest Summer; as of an October that led only to everlasting
 Frost. Medicean Tuileries, how changed since it was a peaceful
 Tile field! Or is the ground itself fate-stricken, accursed: an
 Atreus’ Palace; for that Louvre window is still nigh, out of
 which a Capet, whipt of the Furies, fired his signal of the Saint
 Bartholomew! Dark is the way of the Eternal as mirrored in this
 world of Time: God’s way is in the sea, and His path in the great
 deep.
 Chapter 2.1.II.
 In the Salle de Manége. To believing Patriots, however, it is now clear, that the
 Constitution will march, _marcher_,—had it once legs to stand on.
 Quick, then, ye Patriots, bestir yourselves, and make it; shape
 legs for it! In the _Archevêché_, or Archbishop’s Palace, his
 Grace himself having fled; and afterwards in the Riding-hall,
 named Manege, close on the Tuileries: there does a National
 Assembly apply itself to the miraculous work. Successfully, had
 there been any heaven-scaling Prometheus among them; not
 successfully since there was none! There, in noisy debate, for
 the sessions are occasionally “scandalous,” and as many as three
 speakers have been seen in the Tribune at once,—let us continue
 to fancy it wearing the slow months. Tough, dogmatic, long of wind is Abbé Maury; Ciceronian pathetic
 is Cazalès. Keen-trenchant, on the other side, glitters a young
 Barnave; abhorrent of sophistry; sheering, like keen Damascus
 sabre, all sophistry asunder,—reckless what else he sheer with
 it. Simple seemest thou, O solid Dutch-built Pétion; if solid,
 surely dull. Nor lifegiving in that tone of thine, livelier
 polemical Rabaut. With ineffable serenity sniffs great Sieyes,
 aloft, alone; his Constitution ye may babble over, ye may mar,
 but can by no possibility mend: is not Polity a science he has
 exhausted? Cool, slow, two military Lameths are visible, with
 their quality sneer, or demi-sneer; they shall gallantly refund
 their Mother’s Pension, when the Red Book is produced; gallantly
 be wounded in duels. A Marquis Toulongeon, whose Pen we yet
 thank, sits there; in stoical meditative humour, oftenest silent,
 accepts what destiny will send. Thouret and Parlementary Duport
 produce mountains of Reformed Law; liberal, Anglomaniac,
 available and unavailable. Mortals rise and fall. Shall goose
 Gobel, for example,—or Go(with an umlaut)bel, for he is of
 Strasburg German breed, be a Constitutional Archbishop? Alone of all men there, Mirabeau may begin to discern clearly
 whither all this is tending. Patriotism, accordingly, regrets
 that his zeal seems to be getting cool. In that famed
 Pentecost-Night of the Fourth of August, when new Faith rose
 suddenly into miraculous fire, and old Feudality was burnt up,
 men remarked that Mirabeau took no hand in it; that, in fact, he
 luckily happened to be absent. But did he not defend the _Veto_,
 nay _Veto Absolu;_ and tell vehement Barnave that six hundred
 irresponsible senators would make of all tyrannies the
 insupportablest? Again, how anxious was he that the King’s
 Ministers should have seat and voice in the National
 Assembly;—doubtless with an eye to being Minister himself!
 Whereupon the National Assembly decides, what is very momentous,
 that no Deputy shall be Minister; he, in his haughty stormful
 manner, advising us to make it, “no Deputy called Mirabeau.”[263]
 A man of perhaps inveterate Feudalisms; of stratagems; too often
 visible leanings towards the Royalist side: a man suspect; whom
 Patriotism will unmask! Thus, in these June days, when the
 question _Who shall have right to declare war?_ comes on, you
 hear hoarse Hawkers sound dolefully through the streets, ‘Grand
 Treason of Count Mirabeau, price only one sou;’—because he pleads
 that it shall be not the Assembly but the King! Pleads; nay
 prevails: for in spite of the hoarse Hawkers, and an endless
 Populace raised by them to the pitch even of “_Lanterne_,” he
 mounts the Tribune next day; grim-resolute; murmuring aside to
 his friends that speak of danger: ‘I know it: I must come hence
 either in triumph, or else torn in fragments;’ and it was in
 triumph that he came. A man of stout heart; whose popularity is not of the populace,
 “_pas populacière;_” whom no clamour of unwashed mobs without
 doors, or of washed mobs within, can scarce from his way! Dumont
 remembers hearing him deliver a Report on Marseilles; “every word
 was interrupted on the part of the _Côté Droit_ by abusive
 epithets; calumniator, liar, assassin, scoundrel (_scélérat_):
 Mirabeau pauses a moment, and, in a honeyed tone, addressing the
 most furious, says: ‘I wait, Messieurs, till these amenities be
 exhausted.’”[264] A man enigmatic, difficult to unmask! For
 example, whence comes his money? Can the profit of a Newspaper,
 sorely eaten into by Dame Le Jay; can this, and the eighteen
 francs a-day your National Deputy has, be supposed equal to this
 expenditure? House in the Chaussée d’Antin; Country-house at
 Argenteuil; splendours, sumptuosities, orgies;—living as if he
 had a mint! All saloons barred against Adventurer Mirabeau, are
 flung wide open to King Mirabeau, the cynosure of Europe, whom
 female France flutters to behold,—though the Man Mirabeau is one
 and the same. As for money, one may conjecture that Royalism
 furnishes it; which if Royalism do, will not the same be welcome,
 as money always is to him? “Sold,” whatever Patriotism thinks, he cannot readily be: the
 spiritual fire which is in that man; which shining through such
 confusions is nevertheless Conviction, and makes him strong, and
 without which he had no strength,—is not buyable nor saleable; in
 such transference of barter, it would vanish and not _be_.
 Perhaps “paid and not sold, _payé pas vendu:_” as poor Rivarol,
 in the unhappier converse way, calls himself “sold and not paid!”
 A man travelling, comet-like, in splendour and nebulosity, his
 wild way; whom telescopic Patriotism may long watch, but, without
 higher mathematics, will not make out. A questionable most
 blameable man; yet to us the far notablest of all. With rich
 munificence, as we often say, in a most blinkard, bespectacled,
 logic-chopping generation, Nature has gifted this man with an
 eye. Welcome is his word, there where he speaks and works; and
 growing ever welcomer; for it alone goes to the heart of the
 business: logical cobwebbery shrinks itself together; and thou
 seest a _thing_, how it is, how is may be worked with.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Unhappily our National Assembly has much to do: a France to
 regenerate; and France is short of so many requisites; short even
 of cash! These same Finances give trouble enough; no choking of
 the Deficit; which gapes ever, _Give, give!_ To appease the
 Deficit we venture on a hazardous step, sale of the Clergy’s
 Lands and superfluous Edifices; most hazardous. Nay, given the
 sale, who is to buy them, ready-money having fled? Wherefore, on
 the 19th day of December, a paper-money of “_Assignats_,” of
 Bonds secured, or _assigned_, on that Clerico-National Property,
 and unquestionable at least in payment of that,—is decreed: the
 first of a long series of like financial performances, which
 shall astonish mankind. So that now, while old rags last, there
 shall be no lack of circulating medium; whether of commodities to
 circulate thereon is another question. But, after all, does not
 this Assignat business speak volumes for modern science?
 Bankruptcy, we may say, was come, as the _end_ of all Delusions
 needs must come: yet how gently, in softening diffusion, in mild
 succession, was it hereby made to fall;—like no all-destroying
 avalanche; like gentle showers of a powdery impalpable snow,
 shower after shower, till all was indeed buried, and yet little
 was destroyed that could not be replaced, be dispensed with! To
 such length has modern machinery reached. Bankruptcy, we said,
 was great; but indeed Money itself is a standing miracle. On the whole, it is a matter of endless difficulty, that of the
 Clergy. Clerical property may be made the Nation’s, and the
 Clergy hired servants of the State; but if so, is it not an
 altered Church? Adjustment enough, of the most confused sort, has
 become unavoidable. Old landmarks, in any sense, avail not in a
 new France. Nay literally, the very Ground is new divided; your
 old party-coloured _Provinces_ become new uniform _Departments_,
 Eighty-three in number;—whereby, as in some sudden shifting of
 the Earth’s axis, no mortal knows his new latitude at once. The
 Twelve old Parlements too, what is to be done with them? The old
 Parlements are declared to be all “in permanent vacation,”—till
 once the new equal-justice, of Departmental Courts, National
 Appeal-Court, of elective Justices, Justices of Peace, and other
 Thouret-and-Duport apparatus be got ready. They have to sit
 there, these old Parlements, uneasily waiting; as it were, with
 the rope round their neck; crying as they can, _Is there none to
 deliver us?_ But happily the answer being, _None, none_, they are
 a manageable class, these Parlements. They can be bullied, even
 into silence; the Paris Parliament, wiser than most, has never
 whimpered. They will and must sit there; in such vacation as is
 fit; their Chamber of Vacation distributes in the interim what
 little justice is going. With the rope round their neck, their
 destiny may be succinct! On the 13th of November 1790, Mayor
 Bailly shall walk to the Palais de Justice, few even heeding him;
 and with municipal seal-stamp and a little hot wax, seal up the
 Parlementary Paper-rooms,—and the dread Parlement of Paris pass
 away, into Chaos, gently as does a Dream! So shall the Parlements
 perish, succinctly; and innumerable eyes be dry. Not so the Clergy. For granting even that Religion were dead;
 that it had died, half-centuries ago, with unutterable Dubois; or
 emigrated lately, to Alsace, with Necklace-Cardinal Rohan; or
 that it now walked as goblin _revenant_ with Bishop Talleyrand of
 Autun; yet does not the Shadow of Religion, the Cant of Religion,
 still linger? The Clergy have means and material: means, of
 number, organization, social weight; a material, at lowest, of
 public ignorance, known to be the mother of devotion. Nay,
 withal, is it incredible that there might, in simple hearts,
 latent here and there like gold grains in the mud-beach, still
 dwell some real Faith in God, of so singular and tenacious a sort
 that even a Maury or a Talleyrand, could still be the symbol for
 it?—Enough, and Clergy has strength, the Clergy has craft and
 indignation. It is a most fatal business this of the Clergy. A
 weltering hydra-coil, which the National Assembly has stirred up
 about its ears; hissing, stinging; which cannot be appeased,
 alive; which cannot be trampled dead! Fatal, from first to last!
 Scarcely after fifteen months’ debating, can a _Civil
 Constitution of the Clergy_ be so much as got to paper; and then
 for getting it into reality? Alas, such Civil Constitution is but
 an agreement to disagree. It divides France from end to end, with
 a new split, infinitely complicating all the other
 splits;—Catholicism, what of it there is left, with the Cant of
 Catholicism, raging on the one side, and sceptic Heathenism on
 the other; both, by contradiction , waxing fanatic. What endless
 jarring, of Refractory hated Priests, and Constitutional despised
 ones; of tender consciences, like the King’s, and consciences
 hot-seared, like certain of his People’s: the whole to end in
 Feasts of Reason and a War of La Vendée! So deep-seated is
 Religion in the heart of man, and holds of all infinite passions.
 If the dead echo of it still did so much, what could not the
 living voice of it once do? Finance and Constitution, Law and Gospel: this surely were work
 enough; yet this is not all. In fact, the Ministry, and Necker
 himself whom a brass inscription “fastened by the people over his
 door-lintel” testifies to be the “_Ministre adoré_,” are
 dwindling into clearer and clearer nullity. Execution or
 legislation, arrangement or detail, from their nerveless fingers
 all drops undone; all lights at last on the toiled shoulders of
 an august Representative Body. Heavy-laden National Assembly! It
 has to hear of innumerable fresh revolts, Brigand expeditions; of
 Châteaus in the West, especially of Charter-chests, _Chartiers_,
 set on fire; for there too the overloaded Ass frightfully
 recalcitrates. Of Cities in the South full of heats and
 jealousies; which will end in crossed sabres, Marseilles against
 Toulon, and Carpentras beleaguered by Avignon;—such Royalist
 collision in a career of Freedom; nay Patriot collision, which a
 mere difference of _velocity_ will bring about! Of a Jourdan
 Coup-tete, who has skulked thitherward, from the claws of the
 Chatelet; and will raise whole scoundrel-regiments. Also it has to hear of Royalist _Camp of Jalès:_ Jalès
 mountain-girdled Plain, amid the rocks of the Cevennes; whence
 Royalism, as is feared and hoped, may dash down like a mountain
 deluge, and submerge France! A singular thing this camp of Jalès;
 existing mostly on paper. For the Soldiers at Jalès, being
 peasants or National Guards, were in heart sworn Sansculottes;
 and all that the Royalist Captains could do was, with false
 words, to keep them, or rather keep the report of them, drawn up
 there, visible to all imaginations, for a terror and a sign,—if
 peradventure France might be reconquered by theatrical machinery,
 by the _picture_ of a Royalist Army done to the life![265] Not
 till the third summer was this portent, burning out by fits and
 then fading, got finally extinguished; was the old Castle of
 Jalès, no Camp being visible to the bodily eye, got blown asunder
 by some National Guards. Also it has to hear not only of Brissot and his _Friends of the
 Blacks_, but by and by of a whole St. Domingo blazing skyward;
 blazing in literal fire, and in far worse metaphorical; beaconing
 the nightly main. Also of the shipping interest, and the
 landed-interest, and all manner of interests, reduced to
 distress. Of Industry every where manacled, bewildered; and only
 Rebellion thriving. Of sub-officers, soldiers and sailors in
 mutiny by land and water. Of soldiers, at Nanci, as we shall see,
 needing to be cannonaded by a brave Bouillé. Of sailors, nay the
 very galley-slaves, at Brest, needing also to be cannonaded; but
 with no Bouillé to do it. For indeed, to say it in a word, in
 those days there was _no King_ in Israel, and every man did that
 which was right in his own eyes.[266] Such things has an august National Assembly to hear of, as it
 goes on regenerating France. Sad and stern: but what remedy? Get
 the Constitution ready; and all men will swear to it: for do not
 “Addresses of adhesion” arrive by the cartload? In this manner,
 by Heaven’s blessing, and a Constitution got ready, shall the
 bottomless fire-gulf be vaulted in, with rag-paper; and Order
 will wed Freedom, and live with her there,—till it grow too hot
 for them. _O Côté Gauche_, worthy are ye, as the adhesive
 Addresses generally say, to “fix the regards of the Universe;”
 the regards of this one poor Planet, at lowest!— Nay, it must be owned, the _Côté Droit_ makes a still madder
 figure. An irrational generation; irrational, imbecile, and with
 the vehement obstinacy characteristic of that; a generation which
 will not learn. Falling Bastilles, Insurrections of Women,
 thousands of smoking Manorhouses, a country bristling with no
 crop but that of Sansculottic steel: these were tolerably
 didactic lessons; but them they have not taught. There are still
 men, of whom it was of old written, Bray them in a mortar! Or, in
 milder language, They have _wedded_ their delusions: fire nor
 steel, nor any sharpness of Experience, shall sever the bond;
 till death do us part! Of such may the Heavens have mercy; for
 the Earth, with her rigorous Necessity, will have none. Admit, at the same time, that it was most natural. Man lives by
 Hope: Pandora when her box of gods’-gifts flew all out, and
 became gods’-curses, still retained Hope. How shall an irrational
 mortal, when his high-place is never so evidently pulled down,
 and he, being irrational, is left resourceless,—part with the
 belief that it will be rebuilt? It would make all so straight
 again; it seems so unspeakably desirable; so reasonable,—would
 you but look at it aright! For, must not the thing which was
 continue to be; or else the solid World dissolve? Yes, persist, O
 infatuated Sansculottes of France! Revolt against constituted
 Authorities; hunt out your rightful Seigneurs, who at bottom so
 loved you, and readily shed their blood for you,—in country’s
 battles as at Rossbach and elsewhere; and, even in preserving
 game, were preserving _you_, could ye but have understood it:
 hunt them out, as if they were wild wolves; set fire to their
 Châteaus and Chartiers as to wolf-dens; and what then? Why, then
 turn every man his hand against his fellow! In confusion, famine,
 desolation, regret the days that are gone; rueful recall them,
 recall us with them. To repentant prayers we will not be deaf. So, with dimmer or clearer consciousness, must the Right Side
 reason and act. An inevitable position perhaps; but a most false
 one for them. Evil, be thou our good: this henceforth must
 virtually be their prayer. The fiercer the effervescence grows,
 the sooner will it pass; for after all it is but some mad
 effervescence; the World is solid, and cannot dissolve. For the rest, if they have any positive industry, it is that of
 plots, and backstairs conclaves. Plots which cannot be executed;
 which are mostly theoretic on their part;—for which nevertheless
 this and the other practical Sieur Augeard, Sieur Maillebois,
 Sieur Bonne Savardin, gets into trouble, gets imprisoned, and
 escapes with difficulty. Nay there is a poor practical Chevalier
 Favras who, not without some passing reflex on Monsieur himself,
 gets hanged for them, amid loud uproar of the world. Poor Favras,
 he keeps dictating his last will at the “Hôtel-de-Ville, through
 the whole remainder of the day,” a weary February day; offers to
 reveal secrets, if they will save him; handsomely declines since
 they will not; then dies, in the flare of torchlight, with
 politest composure; remarking, rather than exclaiming, with
 outspread hands: ‘People, I die innocent; pray for me.’[267] Poor
 Favras;—type of so much that has prowled indefatigable over
 France, in days now ending; and, in freer field, might have
 _earned_ instead of prowling,—to thee it is no theory! In the Senate-house again, the attitude of the Right Side is that
 of calm unbelief. Let an august National Assembly make a
 Fourth-of-August Abolition of Feudality; declare the Clergy
 State-servants who shall have wages; vote Suspensive Vetos, new
 Law-Courts; vote or decree what contested thing it will; have it
 responded to from the four corners of France, nay get King’s
 Sanction, and what other Acceptance were conceivable,—the Right
 Side, as we find, persists, with imperturbablest tenacity, in
 considering, and ever and anon shews that it still considers, all
 these so-called Decrees as mere temporary whims, which indeed
 stand on paper, but in practice and fact are not, and cannot be.
 Figure the brass head of an Abbé Maury flooding forth Jesuitic
 eloquence in this strain; dusky d’Espréménil, Barrel Mirabeau
 (probably in liquor), and enough of others, cheering him from the
 Right; and, for example, with what visage a seagreen Robespierre
 eyes him from the Left. And how Sieyes ineffably sniffs on him,
 or does not deign to sniff; and how the Galleries groan in
 spirit, or bark rabid on him: so that to escape the Lanterne, on
 stepping forth, he needs presence of mind, and a pair of pistols
 in his girdle! For he is one of the toughest of men. Here indeed becomes notable one great difference between our two
 kinds of civil war; between the modern _lingual_ or
 Parliamentary-logical kind, and the ancient, or _manual_ kind, in
 the steel battle-field;—much to the disadvantage of the former.
 In the manual kind, where you front your foe with drawn weapon,
 one right stroke is final; for, physically speaking, when the
 brains are out the man does honestly die, and trouble you no
 more. But how different when it is with arguments you fight! Here
 no victory yet definable can be considered as final. Beat him
 down, with Parliamentary invective, till sense be fled; cut him
 in two, hanging one half in this dilemma-horn, the other on that;
 blow the brains or thinking-faculty quite out of him for the
 time: it skills not; he rallies and revives on the morrow;
 tomorrow he repairs his golden fires! The think that _will_
 logically extinguish him is perhaps still a desideratum in
 Constitutional civilisation. For how, till a man know, in some
 measure, at what point he becomes logically defunct, can
 Parliamentary Business be carried on, and Talk cease or slake? Doubtless it was some feeling of this difficulty; and the clear
 insight how little such knowledge yet existed in the French
 Nation, new in the Constitutional career, and how defunct
 Aristocrats would continue to walk for unlimited periods, as
 Partridge the Alamanack-maker did,—that had sunk into the deep
 mind of People’s-friend Marat, an eminently practical mind; and
 had grown there, in that richest putrescent soil, into the most
 original plan of action ever submitted to a People. Not yet has
 it grown; but it has germinated, it is growing; rooting itself
 into Tartarus, branching towards Heaven: the second season hence,
 we shall see it risen out of the bottomless Darkness, full-grown,
 into disastrous Twilight,—a Hemlock-tree, great as the world; on
 or under whose boughs all the People’s-friends of the world may
 lodge. “Two hundred and sixty thousand Aristocrat heads:” that is
 the precisest calculation, though one would not stand on a few
 hundreds; yet we never rise as high as the round three hundred
 thousand. Shudder at it, O People; but it is as true as that ye
 yourselves, and your People’s-friend, are alive. These prating
 Senators of yours hover ineffectual on the barren letter, and
 will never save the Revolution. A Cassandra-Marat cannot do it,
 with his single shrunk arm; but with a few determined men it were
 possible. ‘Give me,’ said the People’s-friend, in his cold way,
 when young Barbaroux, once his pupil in a course of what was
 called Optics, went to see him, ‘Give me two hundred Naples
 Bravoes, armed each with a good dirk, and a muff on his left arm
 by way of shield: with them I will traverse France, and
 accomplish the Revolution.’[268] Nay, be brave, young Barbaroux;
 for thou seest, there is no jesting in those rheumy eyes; in that
 soot-bleared figure, most earnest of created things; neither
 indeed is there madness, of the strait-waistcoat sort. Such produce shall the Time ripen in cavernous Marat, the man
 forbid; living in Paris cellars, lone as fanatic Anchorite in his
 Thebaid; say, as far-seen Simon on his Pillar,—taking peculiar
 views therefrom. Patriots may smile; and, using him as bandog now
 to be muzzled, now to be let bark, name him, as Desmoulins does,
 “Maximum of Patriotism” and “Cassandra-Marat:” but were it not
 singular if this dirk-and-muff plan of his (with superficial
 modifications) proved to be precisely the plan adopted? After this manner, in these circumstances, do august Senators
 regenerate France. Nay, they are, in very deed, _believed_ to be
 regenerating it; on account of which great fact, main fact of
 their history, the wearied eye can never be permitted wholly to
 ignore them. But, looking away now from these precincts of the Tuileries,
 where Constitutional Royalty, let Lafayette water it as he will,
 languishes too like a cut branch; and august Senators are perhaps
 at bottom only perfecting their “theory of defective verbs,”—how
 does the young Reality, young Sansculottism thrive? The attentive
 observer can answer: It thrives bravely; putting forth new buds;
 expanding the old buds into leaves, into boughs. Is not French
 Existence, as before, most prurient, all _loosened_, most
 nutrient for it? Sansculottism has the property of growing by
 what other things die of: by agitation, contention,
 disarrangement; nay in a word, by what is the symbol and fruit of
 all these: Hunger. In such a France as this, Hunger, as we have remarked, can hardly
 fail. The Provinces, the Southern Cities feel it in their turn;
 and what it brings: Exasperation, preternatural Suspicion. In
 Paris some halcyon days of abundance followed the Menadic
 Insurrection, with its Versailles grain-carts, and recovered
 Restorer of Liberty; but they could not continue. The month is
 still October when famishing Saint-Antoine, in a moment of
 passion, seizes a poor Baker, innocent “François the Baker;”[269]
 and hangs him, in Constantinople wise;—but even this, singular as
 it my seem, does not cheapen bread! Too clear it is, no Royal
 bounty, no Municipal dexterity can adequately feed a
 Bastille-destroying Paris. Wherefore, on view of the hanged
 Baker, Constitutionalism in sorrow and anger demands “_Loi
 Martiale_,” a kind of Riot Act;—and indeed gets it, most readily,
 almost before the sun goes down. This is that famed _Martial law_, with its Red Flag, its
 “_Drapeau Rouge:_” in virtue of which Mayor Bailly, or any Mayor,
 has but henceforth to hang out that new _Oriflamme_ of his; then
 to read or mumble something about the King’s peace; and, after
 certain pauses, serve any undispersing Assemblage with
 musket-shot, or whatever shot will disperse it. A decisive Law;
 and most just on one proviso: that all Patrollotism be of God,
 and all mob-assembling be of the Devil;—otherwise not so just.
 Mayor Bailly be unwilling to use it! Hang not out that new
 Oriflamme, _flame_ not _of gold_ but of the want of gold! The
 thrice-blessed Revolution is _done_, thou thinkest? If so it will
 be well with thee. But now let no mortal say henceforth that an august National
 Assembly wants riot: all it ever wanted was riot enough to
 balance Court-plotting; all it now wants, of Heaven or of Earth,
 is to get its theory of defective verbs perfected.
 Chapter 2.1.III.
 The Muster. With famine and a Constitutional theory of defective verbs going
 on, all other excitement is conceivable. A universal shaking and
 sifting of French Existence this is: in the course of which, for
 one thing, what a multitude of low-lying figures are sifted to
 the top, and set busily to work there! Dogleech Marat, now for-seen as Simon Stylites, we already know;
 him and others, raised aloft. The mere sample, these, of what is
 coming, of what continues coming, upwards from the realm of
 Night!—Chaumette, by and by Anaxagoras Chaumette, one already
 descries: mellifluous in street-groups; not now a sea-boy on the
 high and giddy mast: a mellifluous tribune of the common people,
 with long curling locks, on _bourne_stone of the thoroughfares;
 able sub-editor too; who shall rise—to the very gallows. Clerk
 Tallien, he also is become sub-editor; shall become able editor;
 and more. Bibliopolic Momoro, Typographic Pruhomme see new trades
 opening. Collot d’Herbois, tearing a passion to rags, pauses on
 the Thespian boards; listens, with that black bushy head, to the
 sound of the world’s drama: shall the Mimetic become Real? Did ye
 hiss him, O men of Lyons?[270] Better had ye clapped! Happy now, indeed, for all manner of _mimetic_, half-original
 men! Tumid blustering, with more or less of sincerity, which need
 not be entirely sincere, yet the sincerer the better, is like to
 go far. Shall we say, the Revolution-element works itself rarer
 and rarer; so that only lighter and lighter bodies will float in
 it; till at last the mere blown-bladder is your only swimmer?
 Limitation of mind, then vehemence, promptitude, audacity, shall
 all be available; to which add only these two: cunning and good
 lungs. Good fortune must be presupposed. Accordingly, of all
 classes the rising one, we observe, is now the Attorney class:
 witness Bazires, Carriers, Fouquier-Tinvilles, Bazoche-Captain
 Bourdons: more than enough. Such figures shall Night, from her
 wonder-bearing bosom, emit; swarm after swarm. Of another deeper
 and deepest swarm, not yet dawned on the astonished eye; of
 pilfering Candle-snuffers, Thief-valets, disfrocked Capuchins,
 and so many Héberts, Henriots, Ronsins, Rossignols, let us, as
 long as possible, forbear speaking. Thus, over France, all stirs that has what the Physiologists call
 _irritability_ in it: how much more all wherein irritability has
 perfected itself into vitality; into actual vision, and force
 that can will! All stirs; and if not in Paris, flocks thither.
 Great and greater waxes President Danton in his Cordeliers
 Section; his rhetorical tropes are all “gigantic:” energy flashes
 from his black brows, menaces in his athletic figure, rolls in
 the sound of his voice “reverberating from the domes;” this man
 also, like Mirabeau, has a natural _eye_, and begins to see
 whither Constitutionalism is tending, though with a wish in it
 different from Mirabeau’s. Remark, on the other hand, how General Dumouriez has quitted
 Normandy and the Cherbourg Breakwater, to come—whither we may
 guess. It is his second or even third trial at Paris, since this
 New Era began; but now it is in right earnest, for he has quitted
 all else. Wiry, elastic unwearied man; whose life was but a
 battle and a march! No, _not_ a creature of Choiseul’s; ‘the
 creature of God and of my sword,’—he fiercely answered in old
 days. Overfalling Corsican batteries, in the deadly fire-hail;
 wriggling invincible from under his horse, at Closterkamp of the
 Netherlands, though tethered with “crushed stirrup-iron and
 nineteen wounds;” tough, minatory, standing at bay, as forlorn
 hope, on the skirts of Poland; intriguing, battling in cabinet
 and field; roaming far out, obscure, as King’s spial, or sitting
 sealed up, enchanted in Bastille; fencing, pamphleteering,
 scheming and struggling from the very birth of him,[271]—the man
 has come thus far. How repressed, how irrepressible! Like some
 incarnate spirit in prison, which indeed he _was;_ hewing on
 granite walls for deliverance; striking fire flashes from them.
 And now has the general earthquake rent his cavern too? Twenty
 years younger, what might he not have done! But his hair has a
 shade of gray: his way of thought is all fixed, military. He can
 _grow_ no further, and the new world is in such growth. We will
 name him, on the whole, one of Heaven’s Swiss; without faith;
 wanting above all things work, work on _any_ side. Work also is
 appointed him; and he will do it. Not from over France only are the unrestful flocking towards
 Paris; but from all sides of Europe. Where the carcase is,
 thither will the eagles gather. Think how many a Spanish Guzman,
 Martinico Fournier named “Fournier _l’Américain_,” Engineer
 Miranda from the very Andes, were flocking or had flocked!
 Walloon Pereyra might boast of the strangest parentage: him, they
 say, Prince Kaunitz the Diplomatist heedlessly dropped;” like
 ostrich-egg, to be hatched of Chance—into an ostrich-_eater!_
 Jewish or German Freys do business in the great Cesspool of
 _Agio;_ which Cesspool this _Assignat_-fiat has quickened, into a
 Mother of dead dogs. Swiss Clavière could found no Socinian
 Genevese Colony in Ireland; but he paused, years ago, prophetic
 before the Minister’s Hôtel at Paris; and said, it was borne on
 his mind that _he_ one day was to be Minister, and laughed.[272]
 Swiss Pachc, on the other hand, sits sleekheaded, frugal; the
 wonder of his own alley, and even of neighbouring ones, for
 humility of mind, and a thought deeper than most men’s: sit
 there, Tartuffe, till wanted! Ye Italian Dufournys, Flemish
 Prolys, flit hither all ye bipeds of prey! Come whosesoever head
 is hot; thou of mind _ungoverned_, be it chaos as of
 undevelopment or chaos as of ruin; the man who cannot get known,
 the man who is too well known; if thou have any vendible faculty,
 nay if thou have but edacity and loquacity, come! They come; with
 hot unutterabilities in their heart; as Pilgrims towards a
 miraculous shrine. Nay how many come as vacant Strollers,
 aimless, of whom Europe is full merely towards _something!_ For
 benighted fowls, when you beat their bushes, rush towards any
 light. Thus Frederick Baron Trenck too is here; mazed, purblind,
 from the cells of Magdeburg; Minotauric cells, and his Ariadne
 lost! Singular to say, Trenck, in these years, sells wine; not
 indeed in bottle, but in wood. Nor is our England without her missionaries. She has her
 live-saving Needham;[273] to whom was solemnly presented a “civic
 sword,”—long since rusted into nothingness. Her Paine: rebellious
 Staymaker; unkempt; who feels that he, a single Needleman, did by
 his “_Common-Sense_” Pamphlet, free America;—that he can and will
 free all this World; perhaps even the other. Price-Stanhope
 Constitutional Association sends over to congratulate;[274]
 welcomed by National Assembly, though they are but a London Club;
 whom Burke and Toryism eye askance. On thee too, for country’s sake, O Chevalier John Paul, be a word
 spent, or misspent! In faded naval uniform, Paul Jones lingers
 visible here; like a wine-skin from which the wine is all drawn.
 Like the ghost of himself! Low is his once loud bruit; scarcely
 audible, save, with extreme tedium in ministerial ante-chambers;
 in this or the other charitable dining-room, mindful of the past.
 What changes; culminatings and declinings! Not now, poor Paul,
 thou lookest wistful over the Solway brine, by the foot of native
 Criffel, into blue mountainous Cumberland, into blue Infinitude;
 environed with thrift, with humble friendliness; thyself, young
 fool, longing to be aloft from it, or even to be away from it.
 Yes, beyond that sapphire Promontory, which men name St. Bees,
 which is not sapphire either, but dull sandstone, when one gets
 _close_ to it, there is a world. Which world thou too shalt taste
 of!—From yonder White Haven rise his smoke-clouds; ominous though
 ineffectual. Proud Forth quakes at his bellying sails; had not
 the wind suddenly shifted. Flamborough reapers, homegoing, pause
 on the hill-side: for what sulphur-cloud is that that defaces the
 sleek sea; sulphur-cloud spitting streaks of fire? A sea
 cockfight it is, and of the hottest; where British _Serapis_ and
 French-American _Bon Homme Richard_ do lash and throttle each
 other, in their fashion; and lo the desperate valour has
 suffocated the deliberate, and Paul Jones too is of the Kings of
 the Sea! The Euxine, the Méotian waters felt thee next, and long-skirted
 Turks, O Paul; and thy fiery soul has wasted itself in thousand
 contradictions;—to no purpose. For, in far lands, with scarlet
 Nassau-Siegens, with sinful Imperial Catherines, is not the
 heart-broken, even as at home with the mean? Poor Paul! hunger
 and dispiritment track thy sinking footsteps: once or at most
 twice, in this Revolution-tumult the figure of thee emerges;
 mute, ghost-like, as “with stars dim-twinkling through.” And
 then, when the light is gone quite out, a National Legislature
 grants “ceremonial funeral!” As good had been the natural
 Presbyterian Kirk-bell, and six feet of Scottish earth, among the
 dust of thy loved ones.—_Such_ world lay beyond the Promontory of
 St. Bees. Such is the life of sinful mankind here below. But of all strangers, far the notablest for us is Baron Jean
 Baptiste de Clootz;—or, dropping baptisms and feudalisms,
 World-Citizen Anacharsis Clootz, from Cleves. Him mark, judicious
 Reader. Thou hast known his Uncle, sharp-sighted thorough-going
 Cornelius de Pauw, who mercilessly cuts down cherished illusions;
 and of the finest antique Spartans, will make mere modern
 cutthroat Mainots.[275] The like stuff is in Anacharsis: hot
 metal; full of scoriae, which should and could have been smelted
 out, but which will not. He has wandered over this terraqueous
 Planet; seeking, one may say, the Paradise we lost long ago. He
 has seen English Burke; has been seen of the Portugal
 Inquisition; has roamed, and fought, and written; is writing,
 among other things, “Evidences of the _Mahometan_ Religion.” But
 now, like his Scythian adoptive godfather, he finds himself in
 the Paris Athens; surely, at last, the haven of his soul. A
 dashing man, beloved at Patriotic dinner-tables; with gaiety, nay
 with humour; headlong, trenchant, of free purse; in suitable
 costume; though what mortal ever more despised costumes? Under
 all costumes Anacharsis seeks the man; not Stylites Marat will
 more freely trample costumes, if they hold no man. This is the
 faith of Anacharsis: That there is a Paradise discoverable; that
 all costumes ought to hold men. O Anacharsis, it is a headlong,
 swift-going faith. Mounted thereon, meseems, thou art bound
 hastily for the City of _Nowhere;_ and wilt _arrive!_ At best, we
 may say, arrive _in good riding attitude;_ which indeed is
 something. So many new persons, and new things, have come to occupy this
 France. Her old Speech and Thought, and Activity which springs
 from those, are all changing; fermenting towards unknown issues.
 To the dullest peasant, as he sits sluggish, overtoiled, by his
 evening hearth, one idea has come: that of Châteaus burnt; of
 Châteaus combustible. How altered all Coffeehouses, in Province
 or Capital! The _Antre de Procope_ has now other questions than
 the Three Stagyrite Unities to settle; not theatre-controversies,
 but a world-controversy: there, in the ancient pigtail mode, or
 with modern Brutus’ heads, do well-frizzed logicians hold hubbub,
 and Chaos umpire sits. The ever-enduring Melody of Paris Saloons
 has got a new ground-tone: ever-enduring; which has been heard,
 and by the listening Heaven too, since Julian the Apostate’s time
 and earlier; mad now as formerly.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Ex-Censor Suard, _Ex_-Censor, for we have freedom of the Press;
 he may be seen there; impartial, even neutral. Tyrant Grimm rolls
 large eyes, over a questionable coming Time. Atheist Naigeon,
 beloved disciple of Diderot, crows, in his small difficult way,
 heralding glad dawn.[276] But, on the other hand, how many
 Morellets, Marmontels, who had sat all their life hatching
 Philosophe eggs, cackle now, in a state bordering on distraction,
 at the brood they have brought out![277] It was so delightful to
 have one’s Philosophe Theorem demonstrated, crowned in the
 saloons: and now an infatuated people will not continue
 speculative, but have Practice? There also observe Preceptress Genlis, or Sillery, or
 Sillery-Genlis,—for our husband is both Count and Marquis, and we
 have more than one title. Pretentious, frothy; a puritan yet
 creedless; darkening counsel by words without wisdom! For, it is
 in that thin element of the Sentimentalist and
 Distinguished-Female that Sillery-Genlis works; she would gladly
 be sincere, yet can grow no sincerer than sincere-cant:
 sincere-cant of many forms, ending in the devotional form. For
 the present, on a neck still of moderate whiteness, she wears as
 jewel a miniature Bastille, cut on mere sandstone, but then
 actual Bastille sandstone. M. le Marquis is one of d’Orléans’s
 errandmen; in National Assembly, and elsewhere. Madame, for her
 part, trains up a youthful d’Orléans generation in what
 superfinest morality one can; gives meanwhile rather enigmatic
 account of fair Mademoiselle Pamela, the Daughter whom she has
 _adopted_. Thus she, in Palais Royal saloon;—whither, we remark,
 d’Orléans himself, spite of Lafayette, has returned from that
 English “mission” of his: surely no pleasant mission: for the
 English would not speak to him; and Saint Hannah More of England,
 so unlike Saint Sillery-Genlis of France, saw him shunned, in
 Vauxhall Gardens, like one pest-struck,[278] and his red-blue
 impassive visage waxing hardly a shade bluer.
 Chapter 2.1.IV.
 Journalism. As for Constitutionalism, with its National Guards, it is doing
 what it can; and has enough to do: it must, as ever, with one
 hand wave persuasively, repressing Patriotism; and keep the other
 clenched to menace Royalty plotters. A most delicate task;
 requiring tact. Thus, if People’s-friend Marat has today his writ of “_prise de
 corps_, or seizure of body,” served on him, and dives out of
 sight, tomorrow he is left at large; or is even encouraged, as a
 sort of bandog whose baying may be useful. President Danton, in
 open Hall, with reverberating voice, declares that, in a case
 like Marat’s, ‘force may be resisted by force.’ Whereupon the
 Chatelet serves Danton also with a writ;—which, however, as the
 whole Cordeliers District responds to it, what Constable will be
 prompt to execute? Twice more, on new occasions, does the
 Chatelet launch its writ; and twice more in vain: the body of
 Danton cannot be seized by Châtelet; he unseized, should he even
 fly for a season, shall behold the Châtelet itself flung into
 limbo. Municipality and Brissot, meanwhile, are far on with their
 Municipal Constitution. The Sixty _Districts_ shall become
 Forty-eight _Sections;_ much shall be adjusted, and Paris have
 its Constitution. A Constitution wholly Elective; as indeed all
 French Government shall and must be. And yet, one fatal element
 has been introduced: that of _citoyen actif_. No man who does not
 pay the _marc d’argent_, or yearly tax equal to three days’
 labour, shall be other than a _passive_ citizen: not the
 slightest vote for him; were he _acting_, all the year round,
 with sledge hammer, with forest-levelling axe! Unheard of! cry
 Patriot Journals. Yes truly, my Patriot Friends, if Liberty, the
 passion and prayer of all men’s souls, means Liberty to send your
 fifty-thousandth part of a new Tongue-fencer into National
 Debating-club, then, be the gods witness, ye are hardly
 entreated. Oh, if in National _Palaver_ (as the Africans name
 it), such blessedness is verily found, what tyrant would deny it
 to Son of Adam! Nay, might there not be a Female Parliament too,
 with “screams from the Opposition benches,” and “the honourable
 Member borne out in hysterics?” To a Children’s Parliament would
 I gladly consent; or even lower if ye wished it. Beloved
 Brothers! Liberty, one might fear, is actually, as the ancient
 wise men said, of Heaven. On this Earth, where, thinks the
 enlightened public, did a brave little Dame de Staal (not
 Necker’s Daughter, but a far shrewder than she) find the nearest
 approach to Liberty? After mature computation, cool as
 Dilworth’s, her answer is, _In the Bastille._[279] ‘Of Heaven?’
 answer many, asking. Wo that they should _ask;_ for that is the
 very misery! ‘Of Heaven’ means much; share in the National
 Palaver it may, or may as probably _not_ mean. One Sansculottic bough that cannot fail to flourish is
 Journalism. The voice of the People _being_ the voice of God,
 shall not such divine voice make itself heard? To the ends of
 France; and in as many dialects as when the _first_ great Babel
 was to be built! Some loud as the lion; some small as the sucking
 dove. Mirabeau himself has his instructive Journal or Journals,
 with Geneva hodmen working in them; and withal has quarrels
 enough with Dame le Jay, his Female Bookseller, so
 ultra-compliant otherwise.[280] _King’s-friend_ Royou still prints himself. Barrère sheds tears
 of loyal sensibility in _Break of Day_ Journal, though with
 declining sale. But why is Fréron so hot, democratic; Fréron, the
 King’s-friend’s Nephew? He has it by kind, that heat of his:
 _wasp_ Fréron begot him; Voltaire’s _Frélon;_ who fought
 stinging, while sting and poison-bag were left, were it only as
 Reviewer, and over Printed Waste-paper. Constant, illuminative,
 as the nightly lamplighter, issues the useful _Moniteur_, for it
 is now become diurnal: with facts and few commentaries; official,
 safe in the middle:—its able Editors sunk long since, recoverably
 or irrecoverably, in deep darkness. Acid Loustalot, with his
 “vigour,” as of young sloes, shall never ripen, but die untimely:
 his Prudhomme, however, will not let that _Révolutions de Paris_
 die; but edit it himself, with much else,—dull-blustering Printer
 though he be. Of Cassandra-Marat we have spoken often; yet the most surprising
 truth remains to be spoken: that he actually does not want sense;
 but, with croaking gelid throat, croaks out masses of the truth,
 on several things. Nay sometimes, one might almost fancy he had a
 perception of humour, and were laughing a little, far down in his
 inner man. Camille is wittier than ever, and more outspoken,
 cynical; yet sunny as ever. A light melodious creature; “born,”
 as he shall yet say with bitter tears, “to write verses;” light
 Apollo, so clear, soft-lucent, in this war of the Titans, wherein
 he shall not conquer! Folded and hawked Newspapers exist in all countries; but, in such
 a Journalistic element as this of France, other and stranger
 sorts are to be anticipated. What says the English reader to a
 _Journal-Affiche_, Placard Journal; legible to him that has no
 halfpenny; in bright prismatic colours, calling the eye from
 afar? Such, in the coming months, as Patriot Associations, public
 and private, advance, and can subscribe funds, shall plenteously
 hang themselves out: _leaves_, limed leaves, to catch what they
 can! The very Government shall have its Pasted Journal; Louvet,
 busy yet with a new “charming romance,” shall write
 _Sentinelles_, and post them with effect; nay Bertrand de
 Moleville, in his extremity, shall still more cunningly try
 it.[281] Great is Journalism. Is not every Able Editor a Ruler of
 the World, being a persuader of it; though self-elected, yet
 sanctioned, by the sale of his Numbers? Whom indeed the world has
 the readiest method of deposing, should need be: that of merely
 doing _nothing_ to him; which ends in starvation! Nor esteem it small what those Bill-stickers had to do in Paris:
 above Three Score of them: all with their crosspoles, haversacks,
 pastepots; nay with leaden badges, for the Municipality licenses
 them. A Sacred College, properly of World-rulers’ Heralds, though
 not respected as such, in an Era still incipient and raw. They
 made the walls of Paris didactic, suasive, with an ever fresh
 Periodical Literature, wherein he that ran might read: Placard
 Journals, Placard Lampoons, Municipal Ordinances, Royal
 Proclamations; the whole other or vulgar Placard-department
 super-added,—or omitted from contempt! What unutterable things
 the stone-walls spoke, during these five years! But it is all
 gone; Today swallowing Yesterday, and then being in its turn
 swallowed of Tomorrow, even as Speech ever is. Nay what, O thou
 immortal Man of Letters, is Writing itself but Speech conserved
 for a time? The Placard Journal conserved it for one day; some
 Books conserve it for the matter of ten years; nay some for three
 thousand: but what then? Why, _then_, the years being all run, it
 also dies, and the world is rid of it. Oh, were there not a
 spirit in the word of man, as in man himself, that survived the
 audible bodied word, and tended either Godward, or else Devilward
 for evermore, why should he trouble himself much with the truth
 of it, or the falsehood of it, except for commercial purposes?
 His immortality indeed, and whether it shall last half a
 lifetime, or a lifetime and half; is not that a very considerable
 thing? As mortality, was to the runaway, whom Great Fritz bullied
 back into the battle with a: ‘_R—, wollt ihr ewig leben_,
 Unprintable Off-scouring of Scoundrels, would ye live for ever!’ This is the Communication of Thought: how happy when there is any
 Thought to communicate! Neither let the simpler old methods be
 neglected, in their sphere. The Palais-Royal Tent, a tyrannous
 Patrollotism has removed; but can it remove the lungs of man?
 Anaxagoras Chaumette we saw mounted on bourne-stones, while
 Tallien worked sedentary at the subeditorial desk. In any corner
 of the civilised world, a tub can be inverted, and an
 articulate-speaking biped mount thereon. Nay, with contrivance, a
 portable trestle, or folding-stool, can be procured, for love or
 money; this the peripatetic Orator can take in his hand, and,
 driven out here, set it up again there; saying mildly, with a
 Sage Bias, _Omnia mea mecum porto._ Such is Journalism, hawked, pasted, spoken. How changed since One
 old Métra walked this same Tuileries Garden, in gilt cocked hat,
 with Journal at his nose, or held loose-folded behind his back;
 and was a notability of Paris, “Métra the Newsman;”[282] and
 Louis himself was wont to say: _Qu’en dit Métra?_ Since the first
 Venetian News-sheet was sold for a _gazza_, or farthing, and
 named _Gazette!_ We live in a fertile world.
 Chapter 2.1.V.
 Clubbism. Where the heart is full, it seeks, for a thousand reasons, in a
 thousand ways, to impart itself. How sweet, indispensable, in
 such cases, is fellowship; soul mystically strengthening soul!
 The meditative Germans, some think, have been of opinion that
 Enthusiasm in the general means simply excessive
 Congregating—_Schwärmerey_, or _Swarming_. At any rate, do we not
 see glimmering half-red embers, if laid _together_, get into the
 brightest white glow? In such a France, gregarious Reunions will needs multiply,
 intensify; French Life will step out of doors, and, from
 domestic, become a public Club Life. Old Clubs, which already
 germinated, grow and flourish; new every where bud forth. It is
 the sure symptom of Social Unrest: in such way, most infallibly
 of all, does Social Unrest exhibit itself; find solacement, and
 also nutriment. In every French head there hangs now, whether for
 terror or for hope, some prophetic picture of a New France:
 prophecy which brings, nay which almost is, its own fulfilment;
 and in all ways, consciously and unconsciously, works towards
 that. Observe, moreover, how the Aggregative Principle, let it be but
 deep enough, goes on aggregating, and this even in a geometrical
 progression: how when the whole world, in such a plastic time, is
 forming itself into Clubs, some One Club, the strongest or
 luckiest, shall, by friendly attracting, by victorious
 compelling, grow ever stronger, till it become immeasurably
 strong; and all the others, with their strength, be either
 lovingly absorbed into it, or hostilely abolished by it! This if
 the Club-spirit is universal; if the time _is_ plastic. Plastic
 enough is the time, universal the Club-spirit: such an all
 absorbing, paramount One Club cannot be wanting. What a progress, since the first salient-point of the Breton
 Committee! It worked long in secret, not languidly; it has come
 with the National Assembly to Paris; calls itself _Club;_ calls
 itself in imitation, as is thought, of those generous
 Price-Stanhope English, _French Revolution Club;_ but soon, with
 more originality, _Club of Friends of the Constitution._ Moreover
 it has leased, for itself, at a fair rent, the Hall of the
 Jacobin’s Convent, one of our “superfluous edifices;” and does
 therefrom now, in these spring months, begin shining out on an
 admiring Paris. And so, by degrees, under the shorter popular
 title of _Jacobins’ Club_, it shall become memorable to all times
 and lands. Glance into the interior: strongly yet modestly
 benched and seated; as many as Thirteen Hundred chosen Patriots;
 Assembly Members not a few. Barnave, the two Lameths are seen
 there; occasionally Mirabeau, perpetually Robespierre; also the
 ferret-visage of Fouquier-Tinville with other attorneys;
 Anacharsis of Prussian Scythia, and miscellaneous
 Patriots,—though all is yet in the most perfectly clean-washed
 state; decent, nay dignified. President on platform, President’s
 bell are not wanting; oratorical Tribune high-raised; nor
 strangers’ galleries, wherein also sit women. Has any French
 Antiquarian Society preserved that written Lease of the Jacobins
 Convent Hall? Or was it, unluckier even than Magna Charta,
 _clipt_ by sacrilegious Tailors? Universal History is not
 indifferent to it. These Friends of the Constitution have met mainly, as their name
 may foreshadow, to look after Elections when an Election comes,
 and procure fit men; but likewise to consult generally that the
 Commonweal take no damage; one as yet sees not how. For indeed
 let two or three gather together any where, if it be not in
 Church, where all are bound to the _passive_ state; no mortal can
 say accurately, themselves as little as any, for _what_ they are
 gathered. How often has the broached barrel proved not to be for
 joy and heart effusion, but for duel and head-breakage; and the
 promised feast become a Feast of the Lapithae! This Jacobins
 Club, which at first shone resplendent, and was thought to be a
 new celestial Sun for enlightening the Nations, had, as things
 all have, to work through its appointed phases: it burned
 unfortunately more and more lurid, more sulphurous,
 distracted;—and swam at last, through the astonished Heaven, like
 a Tartarean Portent, and lurid-burning Prison of Spirits in Pain. Its style of eloquence? Rejoice, Reader, that thou knowest it
 not, that thou canst never perfectly know. The Jacobins published
 a Journal of Debates, where they that have the heart may examine:
 Impassioned, full-droning Patriotic-eloquence; implacable,
 unfertile—save for Destruction, which was indeed its work: most
 wearisome, though most deadly. Be thankful that Oblivion covers
 so much; that all carrion is by and by buried in the green
 Earth’s bosom, and even makes her grow the greener. The Jacobins
 are buried; but their work is not; it continues “making the tour
 of the world,” as it can. It might be seen lately, for instance,
 with bared bosom and death-defiant eye, as far on as Greek
 Missolonghi; and, strange enough, old slumbering Hellas was
 resuscitated, into _somnambulism_ which will become clear
 wakefulness, by a voice from the Rue St. Honoré! All dies, as we
 often say; except the spirit of man, of what man _does_. Thus has
 not the very House of the Jacobins vanished; scarcely lingering
 in a few old men’s memories? The St. Honoré Market has brushed it
 away, and now where dull-droning eloquence, like a Trump of Doom,
 once shook the world, there is pacific chaffering for poultry and
 greens. The sacred National Assembly Hall itself has become
 common ground; President’s platform permeable to wain and
 dustcart; for the Rue de Rivoli runs there. Verily, at Cockcrow
 (of this Cock or the other), _all_ Apparitions do melt and
 dissolve in space. The Paris _Jacobins_ became “the Mother-Society, _Société-Mère;_”
 and had as many as “three hundred” shrill-tongued daughters in
 “direct correspondence” with her. Of indirectly corresponding,
 what we may call grand-daughters and minute progeny, she counted
 “forty-four thousand!”—But for the present we note only two
 things: the first of them a mere anecdote. One night, a couple of
 brother Jacobins are doorkeepers; for the members take this post
 of duty and honour in rotation, and admit none that have not
 tickets: one doorkeeper was the worthy Sieur Laïs, a patriotic
 Opera-singer, stricken in years, whose windpipe is long since
 closed without result; the other, young, and named Louis
 Philippe, D’Orléans’s firstborn, has in this latter time, after
 unheard-of destinies, become Citizen-King, and struggles to rule
 for a season. All-flesh is grass; higher reedgrass or creeping
 herb. The second thing we have to note is historical: that the
 Mother-Society, even in this its effulgent period, cannot content
 all Patriots. Already it must throw off, so to speak, two
 dissatisfied swarms; a swarm to the right, a swarm to the left.
 One party, which thinks the Jacobins lukewarm, constitutes itself
 into _Club of the Cordeliers;_ a hotter Club: it is Danton’s
 element: with whom goes Desmoulins. The other party, again, which
 thinks the Jacobins scalding-hot, flies off to the right, and
 becomes “Club of 1789, Friends of the _Monarchic_ Constitution.”
 They are afterwards named “_Feuillans Club;_” their place of
 meeting being the Feuillans Convent. Lafayette is, or becomes,
 their chief-man; supported by the respectable Patriot everywhere,
 by the mass of Property and Intelligence,—with the most
 flourishing prospects. They, in these June days of 1790, do, in
 the Palais Royal, dine solemnly with open windows; to the cheers
 of the people; with toasts, with inspiriting songs,—with one song
 at least, among the feeblest ever sung.[283] They shall, in due
 time be hooted forth, over the borders, into Cimmerian Night. Another expressly Monarchic or Royalist Club, “_Club des
 Monarchiens_,” though a Club of ample funds, and all sitting in
 damask sofas, cannot realise the smallest momentary cheer;
 realises only scoffs and groans;—till, ere long, certain Patriots
 in disorderly sufficient number, proceed thither, for a night or
 for nights, and groan it out of pain. Vivacious alone shall the
 Mother-Society and her family be. The very Cordeliers may, as it
 were, return into her bosom, which will have grown warm enough. Fatal-looking! Are not such Societies an incipient New Order of
 Society itself? The Aggregative Principle anew at work in a
 Society grown obsolete, cracked asunder, dissolving into rubbish
 and primary atoms?
 Chapter 2.1.VI.
 Je le jure. With these signs of the times, is it not surprising that the
 dominant feeling all over France was still continually Hope? O
 blessed Hope, sole boon of man; whereby, on his strait prison
 walls, are painted beautiful far-stretching landscapes; and into
 the night of very Death is shed holiest dawn! Thou art to all an
 indefeasible possession in this God’s-world: to the wise a sacred
 Constantine’s-banner, written on the eternal skies; under which
 they _shall_ conquer, for the battle itself is victory: to the
 foolish some secular _mirage_, or shadow of still waters, painted
 on the parched Earth; whereby at least their dusty pilgrimage, if
 devious, becomes cheerfuller, becomes possible. In the death-tumults of a sinking Society, French Hope sees only
 the birth-struggles of a new unspeakably better Society; and
 sings, with full assurance of faith, her brisk Melody, which some
 inspired fiddler has in these very days composed for her,—the
 world-famous _Ça-ira_. Yes; “that will go:” and then there will
 _come—?_ All men hope: even Marat hopes—that Patriotism will take
 muff and dirk. King Louis is not without hope: in the chapter of
 chances; in a flight to some Bouillé; in getting popularized at
 Paris. But what a hoping People he had, judge by the fact, and
 series of facts, now to be noted. Poor Louis, meaning the best, with little insight and even less
 determination of his own, has to follow, in that dim wayfaring of
 his, such signal as may be given him; by backstairs Royalism, by
 official or backstairs Constitutionalism, whichever for the month
 may have convinced the royal mind. If flight to Bouillé, and
 (horrible to think!) a drawing of the civil sword do hang as
 theory, portentous in the background, much nearer is this fact of
 these Twelve Hundred Kings, who sit in the _Salle de Manége_.
 Kings uncontrollable by him, not yet irreverent to him. Could
 kind management of these but prosper, how much better were it
 than armed Emigrants, Turin-intrigues, and the help of Austria!
 Nay, are the _two_ hopes inconsistent? Rides in the suburbs, we
 have found, cost little; yet they always brought _vivats_.[284]
 Still cheaper is a soft word; such as has many times turned away
 wrath. In these rapid days, while France is all getting divided
 into Departments, Clergy about to be remodelled, Popular
 Societies rising, and Feudalism and so much ever is ready to be
 hurled into the melting-pot,—might one not try? On the 4th of February, accordingly, M. le Président reads to his
 National Assembly a short autograph, announcing that his Majesty
 will step over, quite in an unceremonious way, probably about
 noon. Think, therefore, Messieurs, what it may mean; especially,
 how ye will get the Hall decorated a little. The Secretaries’
 Bureau can be shifted down from the platform; on the President’s
 chair be slipped this cover of velvet, “of a violet colour
 sprigged with gold fleur-de-lys;”—for indeed M. le Président has
 had previous notice underhand, and taken counsel with Doctor
 Guillotin. Then some fraction of “velvet carpet,” of like texture
 and colour, cannot that be spread in front of the chair, where
 the Secretaries usually sit? So has judicious Guillotin advised:
 and the effect is found satisfactory. Moreover, as it is probable
 that his Majesty, in spite of the fleur-de-lys-velvet, will stand
 and not sit at all, the President himself, in the interim,
 presides standing. And so, while some honourable Member is
 discussing, say, the division of a Department, Ushers announce:
 ‘His Majesty!’ In person, with small suite, enter Majesty: the
 honourable Member stops short; the Assembly starts to its feet;
 the Twelve Hundred Kings “almost all,” and the Galleries no less,
 do welcome the Restorer of French Liberty with loyal shouts. His
 Majesty’s Speech, in diluted conventional phraseology, expresses
 this mainly: That he, most of all Frenchmen, rejoices to see
 France getting regenerated; is sure, at the same time, that they
 will deal gently with her in the process, and not regenerate her
 _roughly_. Such was his Majesty’s Speech: the feat he performed
 was coming to speak it, and going back again. Surely, except to a very hoping People, there was not much here
 to build upon. Yet what did they not build! The fact that the
 King has spoken, that he has voluntarily come to speak, how
 inexpressibly encouraging! Did not the glance of his royal
 countenance, like concentrated sunbeams, kindle all hearts in an
 august Assembly; nay thereby in an inflammable enthusiastic
 France? To move “Deputation of thanks” can be the happy lot of
 but one man; to go in such Deputation the lot of not many. The
 Deputed have gone, and returned with what highest-flown
 compliment they could; whom also the Queen met, Dauphin in hand.
 And still do not our hearts burn with insatiable gratitude; and
 to one other man a still higher blessedness suggests itself: To
 move that we all renew the National Oath. Happiest honourable Member, with his word so in season as word
 seldom was; magic Fugleman of a whole National Assembly, which
 sat there bursting to do somewhat; Fugleman of a whole onlooking
 France! The President swears; declares that every one shall
 swear, in distinct _je le jure_. Nay the very Gallery sends him
 down a written slip signed, with their Oath on it; and as the
 Assembly now casts an eye that way, the Gallery all stands up and
 swears again. And then out of doors, consider at the
 Hôtel-de-Ville how Bailly, the great Tennis-Court swearer, again
 swears, towards nightful, with all the Municipals, and Heads of
 Districts assembled there. And “M. Danton suggests that the
 public would like to partake:” whereupon Bailly, with escort of
 Twelve, steps forth to the great outer staircase; sways the
 ebullient multitude with stretched hand: takes their oath, with a
 thunder of “rolling drums,” with shouts that rend the welkin. And
 on all streets the glad people, with moisture and fire in their
 eyes, “spontaneously formed groups, and swore one
 another,”[285]—and the whole City was illuminated. This was the
 Fourth of February 1790: a day to be marked white in
 Constitutional annals. Nor is the illumination for a night only, but partially or
 totally it lasts a series of nights. For each District, the
 Electors of each District, will swear specially; and always as
 the District swears; it illuminates itself. Behold them, District
 after District, in some open square, where the Non-Electing
 People can all see and join: with their uplifted right hands, and
 _je le jure:_ with rolling drums, with embracings, and that
 infinite hurrah of the enfranchised,—which any tyrant that there
 may be can consider! Faithful to the King, to the Law, to the
 Constitution which the National Assembly _shall_ make. Fancy, for example, the Professors of Universities parading the
 streets with their young France, and swearing, in an enthusiastic
 manner, not without tumult. By a larger exercise of fancy, expand
 duly this little word: The like was repeated in every Town and
 District of France! Nay one Patriot Mother, in Lagnon of
 Brittany, assembles her ten children; and, with her own aged
 hand, swears them all herself, the highsouled venerable woman. Of
 all which, moreover, a National Assembly must be eloquently
 apprised. Such three weeks of swearing! Saw the sun ever such a
 swearing people? Have they been bit by a swearing tarantula? No:
 but they are men and Frenchmen; they have Hope; and, singular to
 say, they have Faith, were it only in the Gospel according to
 Jean Jacques. O my Brothers! would to Heaven it were even as ye
 think and have sworn! But there are Lovers’ Oaths, which, had
 they been true as love itself, _cannot_ be kept; not to speak of
 Dicers’ Oaths, also a known sort.
 Chapter 2.1.VII.
 Prodigies. To such length had the _Contrat Social_ brought it, in believing
 hearts. Man, as is well said, lives by faith; each generation has
 its own faith, more or less; and laughs at the faith of its
 predecessor,—most unwisely. Grant indeed that this faith in the
 Social Contract belongs to the stranger sorts; that an unborn
 generation may very wisely, if not laugh, yet stare at it, and
 piously consider. For, alas, what is _Contrat?_ If all men were
 such that a mere spoken or sworn Contract would bind them, all
 men were then true men, and Government a superfluity. Not what
 thou and I have promised to each other, but what the balance of
 our forces can make us perform to each other: that, in so sinful
 a world as ours, is the thing to be counted on. But above all, a
 People and a Sovereign promising to one another; as if a whole
 People, changing from generation to generation, nay from hour to
 hour, could ever by any method be made to _speak_ or promise; and
 to speak mere solecisms:‘We, be the Heavens witness, which
 Heavens however do no miracles now; we, ever-changing Millions,
 will _allow_ thee, changeful Unit, to _force_ us or govern us!’
 The world has perhaps seen few faiths comparable to that. So nevertheless had the world then construed the matter. Had they
 _not_ so construed it, how different had their hopes been, their
 attempts, their results! But so and not otherwise did the Upper
 Powers will it to be. Freedom by Social Contract: such was verily
 the Gospel of that Era. And all men had believed in it, as in a
 Heaven’s Glad-tidings men should; and with overflowing heart and
 uplifted voice clave to it, and stood fronting Time and Eternity
 on it. Nay smile not; or only with a smile sadder than tears!
 This too was a better faith than the one it had replaced: than
 faith merely in the Everlasting Nothing and man’s Digestive
 Power; lower than _which_ no faith can go. Not that such universally prevalent, universally jurant, feeling
 of Hope, could be a unanimous one. Far from that! The time was
 ominous: social dissolution near and certain; social renovation
 still a problem, difficult and distant even though sure. But if
 ominous to some clearest onlooker, whose faith stood not with one
 side or with the other, nor in the ever-vexed jarring of Greek
 with Greek at all,—how unspeakably ominous to dim Royalist
 participators; for whom Royalism was Mankind’s palladium; for
 whom, with the abolition of Most-Christian Kingship and
 Most-Talleyrand Bishopship, all loyal obedience, all religious
 faith was to expire, and final Night envelope the Destinies of
 Man! On serious hearts, of that persuasion, the matter sinks down
 deep; prompting, as we have seen, to backstairs Plots, to
 Emigration with pledge of war, to Monarchic Clubs; nay to still
 madder things. The Spirit of Prophecy, for instance, had been considered extinct
 for some centuries: nevertheless these last-times, as indeed is
 the tendency of last-times, do revive it; that so, of French mad
 things, we might have sample also of the maddest. In remote rural
 districts, whither Philosophism has not yet radiated, where a
 heterodox Constitution of the Clergy is bringing strife round the
 altar itself, and the very Church-bells are getting melted into
 small money-coin, it appears probable that the End of the World
 cannot be far off. Deep-musing atrabiliar old men, especially old
 women, hint in an obscure way that they know what they know. The
 Holy Virgin, silent so long, has not gone dumb;—and truly now, if
 ever more in this world, were the time for her to speak. One
 Prophetess, though careless Historians have omitted her name,
 condition, and whereabout, becomes audible to the general ear;
 credible to not a few: credible to Friar Gerle, poor Patriot
 Chartreux, in the National Assembly itself! She, in Pythoness’
 recitative, with wildstaring eye, sings that there shall be a
 Sign; that the heavenly Sun himself will hang out a Sign, or
 Mock-Sun,—which, many say, shall be stamped with the Head of
 hanged Favras. List, Dom Gerle, with that poor addled poll of
 thine; list, O list;—and hear nothing.[286]');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Notable however was that “magnetic vellum, _vélin magnétique_,”
 of the Sieurs d’Hozier and Petit-Jean, Parlementeers of Rouen.
 Sweet young d’Hozier, “bred in the faith of his Missal, and of
 parchment genealogies,” and of parchment generally: adust,
 melancholic, middle-aged Petit-Jean: why came these two to
 Saint-Cloud, where his Majesty was hunting, on the festival of
 St. Peter and St. Paul; and waited there, in antechambers, a
 wonder to whispering Swiss, the livelong day; and even waited
 without the Grates, when turned out; and had dismissed their
 valets to Paris, as with purpose of endless waiting? They have a
 _magnetic vellum_, these two; whereon the Virgin, wonderfully
 clothing herself in Mesmerean Cagliostric Occult-Philosophy, has
 inspired them to jot down instructions and predictions for a
 much-straitened King. To whom, by Higher Order, they will this
 day present it; and save the Monarchy and World. Unaccountable
 pair of visual-objects! Ye should be men, and of the Eighteenth
 Century; but your magnetic vellum forbids us so to interpret.
 Say, are ye aught? Thus ask the Guardhouse Captains, the Mayor of
 St. Cloud; nay, at great length, thus asks the Committee of
 Researches, and not the Municipal, but the National Assembly one.
 No distinct answer, for weeks. At last it becomes plain that the
 right answer is _negative_. Go, ye Chimeras, with your magnetic
 vellum; sweet young Chimera, adust middle-aged one! The
 Prison-doors are open. Hardly again shall ye preside the Rouen
 Chamber of Accounts; but vanish obscurely into Limbo.[287]
 Chapter 2.1.VIII.
 Solemn League and Covenant. Such dim masses, and specks of even deepest black, work in that
 white-hot glow of the French mind, now wholly in fusion, and
 _con_fusion. Old women here swearing their ten children on the
 new Evangel of Jean Jacques; old women there looking up for
 Favras’ Heads in the celestial Luminary: these _are_
 preternatural signs, prefiguring somewhat. In fact, to the Patriot children of Hope themselves, it is
 undeniable that difficulties exist: emigrating Seigneurs;
 Parlements in sneaking but most malicious mutiny (though the rope
 is round their neck); above all, the most decided “deficiency of
 grains.” Sorrowful: but, to a Nation that hopes, not
 irremediable. To a Nation which is in fusion and ardent communion
 of thought; which, for example, on signal of one Fugleman, will
 lift its right hand like a drilled regiment, and swear and
 illuminate, till every village from Ardennes to the Pyrenees has
 rolled its village-drum, and sent up its little oath, and glimmer
 of tallow-illumination some fathoms into the reign of Night! If grains are defective, the fault is not of Nature or National
 Assembly, but of Art and Antinational Intriguers. Such malign
 individuals, of the scoundrel species, have power to vex us,
 while the Constitution is a-making. Endure it, ye heroic
 Patriots: nay rather, why not cure it? Grains do grow, they lie
 extant there in sheaf or sack; only that regraters and Royalist
 plotters, to provoke the people into illegality, obstruct the
 transport of grains. Quick, ye organised Patriot Authorities,
 armed National Guards, meet together; unite your goodwill; in
 union is tenfold strength: let the concentred flash of your
 Patriotism strike stealthy Scoundrelism blind, paralytic, as with
 a _coup de soleil._ Under which hat or nightcap of the Twenty-five millions, this
 pregnant Idea first rose, for in some one head it did rise, no
 man can now say. A most small idea, near at hand for the whole
 world: but a living one, fit; and which waxed, whether into
 greatness or not, into immeasurable size. When a Nation is in
 this state that the Fugleman can operate on it, what will the
 word in season, the act in season, not do! It will grow verily,
 like the Boy’s Bean in the Fairy-Tale, heaven-high, with
 habitations and adventures on it, in one night. It is
 nevertheless unfortunately still a Bean (for your long-lived Oak
 grows _not_ so); and, the next night, it may lie felled,
 horizontal, trodden into common mud.—But remark, at least, how
 natural to any agitated Nation, which has Faith, this business of
 Covenanting is. The Scotch, believing in a righteous Heaven above
 them, and also in a Gospel, far other than the Jean-Jacques one,
 swore, in their extreme need, a Solemn League and Covenant,—as
 Brothers on the forlorn-hope, and imminence of battle, who
 embrace looking Godward; and got the whole Isle to swear it; and
 even, in their tough Old-Saxon Hebrew-Presbyterian way, to keep
 it more or less;—for the thing, as such things are, was heard in
 Heaven, and partially ratified there; neither is it yet dead, if
 thou wilt look, nor like to die. The French too, with their
 Gallic-Ethnic excitability and effervescence, have, as we have
 seen, real Faith, of a sort; they are hard bestead, though in the
 middle of Hope: a National Solemn League and Covenant there may
 be in France too; under how different conditions; with how
 different developement and issue! Note, accordingly, the small commencement; first spark of a
 mighty firework: for if the particular _hat_ cannot be fixed
 upon, the particular District can. On the 29th day of last
 November, were National Guards by the thousand seen filing, from
 far and near, with military music, with Municipal officers in
 tricolor sashes, towards and along the Rhone-stream, to the
 little town of Etoile. There with ceremonial evolution and
 manœuvre, with fanfaronading, musketry-salvoes, and what else the
 Patriot genius could devise, they made oath and obtestation to
 stand faithfully by one another, under Law and King; in
 particular, to have all manner of grains, while grains there
 were, freely circulated, in spite both of robber and regrater.
 This was the meeting of Etoile, in the mild end of November 1789. But now, if a mere empty Review, followed by Review-dinner, ball,
 and such gesticulation and flirtation as there may be, interests
 the happy County-town, and makes it the envy of surrounding
 County-towns, how much more might this! In a fortnight, larger
 Montélimart, half ashamed of itself, will do as good, and better.
 On the Plain of Montélimart, or what is equally sonorous, “under
 the Walls of Montélimart,” the thirteenth of December sees new
 gathering and obtestation; six thousand strong; and now indeed,
 with these three remarkable improvements, as unanimously resolved
 on there. First that the men of Montélimart do federate with the
 already federated men of Etoile. Second, that, implying not
 expressing the circulation of grain, they “swear in the face of
 God and their Country” with much more emphasis and
 comprehensiveness, “to obey all decrees of the National Assembly,
 and see them obeyed, till death, _jusqu’à la mort_.” Third, and
 most important, that official record of all this be solemnly
 delivered in to the National Assembly, to M. de Lafayette, and
 “to the Restorer of French Liberty;” who shall all take what
 comfort from it they can. Thus does larger Montélimart vindicate
 its Patriot importance, and maintain its rank in the municipal
 scale.[288] And so, with the New-year, the signal is hoisted; for is not a
 National Assembly, and solemn deliverance there, at lowest a
 National Telegraph? Not only grain shall circulate, while there
 is grain, on highways or the Rhone-waters, over all that
 South-Eastern region,—where also if Monseigneur d’Artois saw good
 to break in from Turin, hot welcome might wait him; but
 whatsoever Province of France is straitened for grain, or vexed
 with a mutinous Parlement, unconstitutional plotters, Monarchic
 Clubs, or any other Patriot ailment,—can go and do likewise, or
 even do better. And now, especially, when the February swearing
 has set them all agog! From Brittany to Burgundy, on most plains
 of France, under most City-walls, it is a blaring of trumpets,
 waving of banners, a constitutional manœuvring: under the vernal
 skies, while Nature too is putting forth her green Hopes, under
 bright sunshine defaced by the stormful East; like Patriotism
 victorious, though with difficulty, over Aristocracy and defect
 of grain! There march and constitutionally wheel, to the
 _ça-ira_-ing mood of fife and drum, under their tricolor
 Municipals, our clear-gleaming Phalanxes; or halt, with uplifted
 right-hand, and artillery-salvoes that imitate Jove’s thunder;
 and all the Country, and metaphorically all “the Universe,” is
 looking on. Wholly, in their best apparel, brave men, and
 beautifully dizened women, most of whom have lovers there;
 swearing, by the eternal Heavens and this green-growing
 all-nutritive Earth, that France is free! Sweetest days, when (astonishing to say) mortals have actually
 met together in communion and fellowship; and man, were it only
 once through long despicable centuries, is for moments verily the
 brother of man!—And then the Deputations to the National
 Assembly, with highflown descriptive harangue; to M. de
 Lafayette, and the Restorer; very frequently moreover to the
 Mother of Patriotism sitting on her stout benches in that Hall of
 the Jacobins! The general ear is filled with Federation. New
 names of Patriots emerge, which shall one day become familiar:
 Boyer-Fonfrede eloquent denunciator of a rebellious Bourdeaux
 Parlement; Max Isnard eloquent reporter of the Federation of
 Draguignan; eloquent pair, separated by the whole breadth of
 France, who are nevertheless to meet. Ever wider burns the flame
 of Federation; ever wider and also brighter. Thus the Brittany
 and Anjou brethren mention a Fraternity of _all_ true Frenchmen;
 and go the length of invoking “perdition and death” on any
 renegade: moreover, if in their National-Assembly harangue, they
 glance plaintively at the _marc d’argent_ which makes so many
 citizens _passive_, they, over in the Mother-Society, ask, being
 henceforth themselves “neither Bretons nor Angevins but French,”
 Why all France has not one Federation, and universal Oath of
 Brotherhood, once for all?[289] A most pertinent suggestion;
 dating from the end of March. Which pertinent suggestion the
 whole Patriot world cannot but catch, and reverberate and agitate
 till it become _loud;_—which, in that case, the Townhall
 Municipals had better take up, and meditate. Some universal Federation seems inevitable: the Where is given;
 clearly Paris: only the When, the How? These also productive Time
 will give; is already giving. For always as the Federative work
 goes on, it perfects itself, and Patriot genius adds contribution
 after contribution. Thus, at Lyons, in the end of the May month,
 we behold as many as fifty, or some say sixty thousand, met to
 federate; and a multitude looking on, which it would be difficult
 to number. From dawn to dusk! For our Lyons Guardsmen took rank,
 at five in the bright dewy morning; came pouring in,
 bright-gleaming, to the Quai de Rhone, to march thence to the
 Federation-field; amid wavings of hats and lady-handkerchiefs;
 glad shoutings of some two hundred thousand Patriot voices and
 hearts; the beautiful and brave! Among whom, courting no notice,
 and yet the notablest of all, what queenlike Figure is this; with
 her escort of house-friends and Champagneux the Patriot Editor;
 come abroad with the earliest? Radiant with enthusiasm are those
 dark eyes, is that strong Minerva-face, looking dignity and
 earnest joy; joyfullest she where all are joyful. It is Roland de
 la Platrière’s Wife![290] Strict elderly Roland, King’s Inspector
 of Manufactures here; and now likewise, by popular choice, the
 strictest of our new Lyons Municipals: a man who has gained much,
 if worth and faculty be gain; but above all things, has gained to
 wife Phlipon the Paris Engraver’s daughter. Reader, mark that
 queenlike burgher-woman: beautiful, Amazonian-graceful to the
 eye; more so to the mind. Unconscious of her worth (as all worth
 is), of her greatness, of her crystal clearness; genuine, the
 creature of Sincerity and Nature, in an age of Artificiality,
 Pollution and Cant; there, in her still completeness, in her
 still invincibility, _she_, if thou knew it, is the noblest of
 all living Frenchwomen,—and will be seen, one day. O blessed
 rather while unseen, even of herself! For the present she gazes,
 nothing doubting, into this grand theatricality; and thinks her
 young dreams are to be fulfilled. From dawn to dusk, as we said, it lasts; and truly a sight like
 few. Flourishes of drums and trumpets are something: but think of
 an “artificial Rock fifty feet high,” all cut into crag-steps,
 not without the similitude of “shrubs!” The interior cavity, for
 in sooth it is made of deal,—stands solemn, a “Temple of
 Concord:” on the outer summit rises “a Statue of Liberty,”
 colossal, seen for miles, with her Pike and Phrygian Cap, and
 civic column; at her feet a Country’s Altar, “_Autel de la
 Patrie:_”—on all which neither deal-timber nor lath and plaster,
 with paint of various colours, have been spared. But fancy then
 the banners all placed on the steps of the Rock; high-mass
 chaunted; and the civic oath of fifty thousand: with what
 volcanic outburst of sound from iron and other throats, enough to
 frighten back the very Saone and Rhone; and how the brightest
 fireworks, and balls, and even repasts closed in that night of
 the gods![291] And so the Lyons Federation vanishes too,
 swallowed of darkness;—and yet not wholly, for our brave fair
 Roland was there; also she, though in the deepest privacy, writes
 her Narrative of it in Champagneux’s _Courier de Lyons;_ a piece
 which “circulates to the extent of sixty thousand;” which one
 would like now to read. But on the whole, Paris, we may see, will have little to devise;
 will only have to borrow and apply. And then as to the day, what
 day of all the calendar is fit, if the Bastille Anniversary be
 not? The particular spot too, it is easy to see, must be the
 Champ-de-Mars; where many a Julian the Apostate has been lifted
 on bucklers, to France’s or the world’s sovereignty; and iron
 Franks, loud-clanging, have responded to the voice of a
 Charlemagne; and from of old mere sublimities have been familiar.
 Chapter 2.1.IX.
 Symbolic. How natural, in all decisive circumstances, is Symbolic
 Representation to all kinds of men! Nay, what is man’s whole
 terrestrial Life but a Symbolic Representation, and making
 visible, of the Celestial invisible Force that is in him? By act
 and word he strives to do it; with sincerity, if possible;
 failing that, with theatricality, which latter also may have its
 meaning. An Almack’s Masquerade is not nothing; in more genial
 ages, your Christmas Guisings, Feasts of the Ass, Abbots of
 Unreason, were a considerable something: since sport they were;
 as Almacks may still be sincere wish for sport. But what, on the
 other hand, must not sincere earnest have been: say, a Hebrew
 Feast of Tabernacles have been! A whole Nation gathered, in the
 name of the Highest, under the eye of the Highest; imagination
 herself flagging under the reality; and all noblest Ceremony as
 yet not grown ceremonial, but solemn, significant to the outmost
 fringe! Neither, in modern private life, are theatrical scenes,
 of tearful women wetting whole ells of cambric in concert, of
 impassioned bushy-whiskered youth threatening suicide, and such
 like, to be so entirely detested: drop thou a tear over them
 thyself rather. At any rate, one can remark that no Nation will throw-by its
 work, and deliberately go out to make a scene, without meaning
 something thereby. For indeed no scenic individual, with knavish
 hypocritical views, will take the trouble to _soliloquise_ a
 scene: and now consider, is not a scenic Nation placed precisely
 in that predicament of soliloquising; for its own behoof alone;
 to solace its own sensibilities, maudlin or other?—Yet in this
 respect, of readiness for scenes, the difference of Nations, as
 of men, is very great. If our Saxon-Puritanic friends, for
 example, swore and signed their National Covenant, without
 discharge of gunpowder, or the beating of any drum, in a dingy
 Covenant-Close of the Edinburgh High-street, in a mean room,
 where men now drink mean liquor, it was consistent with their
 ways so to swear it. Our Gallic-Encyclopedic friends, again, must
 have a Champ-de-Mars, seen of all the world, or universe; and
 such a Scenic Exhibition, to which the Coliseum Amphitheatre was
 but a stroller’s barn, as this old Globe of ours had never or
 hardly ever beheld. Which method also we reckon natural, then and
 there. Nor perhaps was the respective _keeping_ of these two
 Oaths far out of due proportion to such respective display in
 taking them: inverse proportion, namely. For the theatricality of
 a People goes in a compound-ratio: ratio indeed of their
 trustfulness, sociability, fervency; but then also of their
 excitability, of their porosity, not _continent;_ or say, of
 their explosiveness, hot-flashing, but which does not last. How true also, once more, is it that no man or Nation of men,
 _conscious_ of doing a great thing, was ever, in that thing,
 doing other than a small one! O Champ-de-Mars Federation, with
 three hundred drummers, twelve hundred wind-musicians, and
 artillery planted on height after height to boom the tidings of
 it all over France, in few minutes! Could no Atheist-Naigeon
 contrive to discern, eighteen centuries off, those Thirteen most
 poor mean-dressed men, at frugal Supper, in a mean Jewish
 dwelling, with no symbol but hearts god-initiated into the
 “Divine depth of Sorrow,” and a _Do this in remembrance of
 me;_—and so cease that small difficult crowing of his, if he were
 not doomed to it?
 Chapter 2.1.X.
 Mankind. Pardonable are human theatricalities; nay perhaps touching, like
 the passionate utterance of a tongue which with sincerity
 _stammers;_ of a head which with insincerity _babbles_,—having
 gone distracted. Yet, in comparison with unpremeditated outbursts
 of Nature, such as an Insurrection of Women, how foisonless,
 unedifying, undelightful; like small ale palled, like an
 effervescence that has effervesced! Such scenes, coming of
 forethought, were they world-great, and never so cunningly
 devised, are at bottom mainly pasteboard and paint. But the
 others are original; emitted from the great everliving heart of
 Nature herself: what figure _they_ will assume is unspeakably
 significant. To us, therefore, let the French National Solemn
 League, and Federation, be the highest recorded triumph of the
 Thespian Art; triumphant surely, since the whole Pit, which was
 of Twenty-five Millions, not only claps hands, but does itself
 spring on the boards and passionately set to playing there. And
 being such, be it treated as such: with sincere cursory
 admiration; with wonder from afar. A whole Nation gone mumming
 deserves so much; but deserves not that loving minuteness a
 Menadic Insurrection did. Much more let prior, and as it were,
 rehearsal scenes of Federation come and go, henceforward, as they
 list; and, on Plains and under City-walls, innumerable regimental
 bands blare off into the Inane, without note from us. One scene, however, the hastiest reader will momentarily pause
 on: that of Anacharsis Clootz and the Collective sinful Posterity
 of Adam.—For a Patriot Municipality has now, on the 4th of June,
 got its plan concocted, and got it sanctioned by National
 Assembly; a Patriot King assenting; to whom, were he even free to
 dissent, Federative harangues, overflowing with loyalty, have
 doubtless a transient sweetness. There shall come Deputed
 National Guards, so many in the hundred, from each of the
 Eighty-three Departments of France. Likewise from all Naval and
 Military King’s Forces, shall Deputed quotas come; such
 Federation of National with Royal Soldier has, taking place
 spontaneously, been already seen and sanctioned. For the rest, it
 is hoped, as many as forty thousand may arrive: expenses to be
 borne by the Deputing District; of all which let District and
 Department take thought, and elect fit men,—whom the Paris
 brethren will fly to meet and welcome. Now, therefore, judge if our Patriot Artists are busy; taking
 deep counsel how to make the Scene worthy of a look from the
 Universe! As many as fifteen thousand men, spade-men, barrow-men,
 stone-builders, rammers, with their engineers, are at work on the
 Champ-de-Mars; hollowing it out into a natural Amphitheatre, fit
 for such solemnity. For one may hope it will be annual and
 perennial; a “Feast of Pikes, _Fête des Piques_,” notablest among
 the high-tides of the year: in any case ought not a Scenic free
 Nation to have some permanent National Amphitheatre? The
 Champ-de-Mars is getting hollowed out; and the daily talk and the
 nightly dream in most Parisian heads is of Federation, and that
 only. Federate Deputies are already under way. National Assembly,
 what with its natural work, what with hearing and answering
 harangues of Federates, of this Federation, will have enough to
 do! Harangue of “American Committee,” among whom is that faint
 figure of Paul Jones “as with the stars dim-twinkling through
 it,”—come to congratulate us on the prospect of such auspicious
 day. Harangue of Bastille Conquerors, come to “renounce” any
 special recompense, any peculiar place at the solemnity;—since
 the Centre Grenadiers rather grumble. Harangue of “Tennis-Court
 Club,” who enter with far-gleaming Brass-plate, aloft on a pole,
 and the Tennis-Court Oath engraved thereon; which far gleaming
 Brass-plate they purpose to affix solemnly in the Versailles
 original locality, on the 20th of this month, which is the
 anniversary, as a deathless memorial, for some years: they will
 then dine, as they come back, in the Bois de
 Boulogne;[292]—cannot, however, do it without apprising the
 world. To such things does the august National Assembly ever and
 anon cheerfully listen, suspending its regenerative labours; and
 with some touch of impromptu eloquence, make friendly reply;—as
 indeed the wont has long been; for it is a gesticulating,
 sympathetic People, and has a heart, and wears it on its sleeve. In which circumstances, it occurred to the mind of Anacharsis
 Clootz that while so much was embodying itself into Club or
 Committee, and perorating applauded, there yet remained a greater
 and greatest; of which, if _it_ also took body and perorated,
 what might not the effect be: Humankind namely, _le Genre Humain_
 itself! In what rapt creative moment the Thought rose in
 Anacharsis’s soul; all his throes, while he went about giving
 shape and birth to it; how he was sneered at by cold worldlings;
 but did sneer again, being a man of polished sarcasm; and moved
 to and fro persuasive in coffeehouse and soirée, and dived down
 assiduous-obscure in the great deep of Paris, making his Thought
 a Fact: of all this the spiritual biographies of that period say
 nothing. Enough that on the 19th evening of June 1790, the Sun’s
 slant rays lighted a spectacle such as our foolish little Planet
 has not often had to show: Anacharsis Clootz entering the august
 Salle de Manége, with the Human Species at his heels. Swedes,
 Spaniards, Polacks; Turks, Chaldeans, Greeks, dwellers in
 Mesopotamia: behold them all; they have come to claim place in
 the grand Federation, having an undoubted interest in it. ‘Our ambassador titles,’ said the fervid Clootz, ‘are not written
 on parchment, but on the living hearts of all men.’ These
 whiskered Polacks, long-flowing turbaned Ishmaelites,
 astrological Chaldeans, who stand so mute here, let them plead
 with you, august Senators, more eloquently than eloquence could.
 They are the mute representatives of their tongue-tied,
 befettered, heavy-laden Nations; who from out of that dark
 bewilderment gaze wistful, amazed, with half-incredulous hope,
 towards you, and this your bright light of a French Federation:
 bright particular day-star, the herald of universal day. We claim
 to stand there, as mute monuments, pathetically adumbrative of
 much.—From bench and gallery comes “repeated applause;” for what
 august Senator but is flattered even by the very shadow of Human
 Species depending on him? From President Sieyes, who presides
 this remarkable fortnight, in spite of his small voice, there
 comes eloquent though shrill reply. Anacharsis and the
 “Foreigners Committee” shall have place at the Federation; on
 condition of telling their respective Peoples what they see
 there. In the mean time, we invite them to the “honours of the
 sitting, _honneur de la séance_.” A long-flowing Turk, for
 rejoinder, bows with Eastern solemnity, and utters articulate
 sounds: but owing to his imperfect knowledge of the French
 dialect,[293] his words are like spilt water; the thought he had
 in him remains conjectural to this day. Anacharsis and Mankind accept the honours of the sitting; and
 have forthwith, as the old Newspapers still testify, the
 satisfaction to see several things. First and chief, on the
 motion of Lameth, Lafayette, Saint-Fargeau and other Patriot
 Nobles, let the others repugn as they will: all Titles of
 Nobility, from Duke to Esquire, or lower, are henceforth
 _abolished_. Then, in like manner, Livery Servants, or rather the
 Livery of Servants. Neither, for the future, shall any man or
 woman, self-styled noble, be “incensed,”—foolishly fumigated with
 incense, in Church; as the wont has been. In a word, Feudalism
 being dead these ten months, why should her empty trappings and
 scutcheons survive? The very Coats-of-arms will require to be
 obliterated;—and yet Cassandra Marat on this and the other
 coach-panel notices that they “are but painted-over,” and
 threaten to peer through again. So that henceforth de Lafayette is but the Sieur Motier, and
 Saint-Fargeau is plain Michel Lepelletier; and Mirabeau soon
 after has to say huffingly, ‘With your _Riquetti_ you have set
 Europe at cross-purposes for three days.’ For his Counthood is
 not indifferent to this man; which indeed the admiring People
 treat him with to the last. But let extreme Patriotism rejoice,
 and chiefly Anacharsis and Mankind; for now it seems to be taken
 for granted that one Adam is Father of us all!— Such was, in historical accuracy, the famed feat of Anacharsis.
 Thus did the most extensive of Public Bodies find a sort of
 spokesman. Whereby at least we may judge of one thing: what a
 humour the once sniffing mocking City of Paris and Baron Clootz
 had got into; when such exhibition could appear a propriety, next
 door to a sublimity. It is true, Envy did in after times, pervert
 this success of Anacharsis; making him, from incidental “Speaker
 of the Foreign-Nations Committee,” claim to be official permanent
 “Speaker, _Orateur_, of the Human Species,” which he only
 deserved to be; and alleging, calumniously, that his astrological
 Chaldeans, and the rest, were a mere French tag-rag-and-bobtail
 disguised for the nonce; and, in short, sneering and fleering at
 him in _her_ cold barren way; all which, however, he, the man he
 was, could receive on thick enough panoply, or even rebound
 therefrom, and also go _his_ way. Most extensive of Public Bodies, we may call it; and also the
 most unexpected: for who could have thought to see All Nations in
 the Tuileries Riding-Hall? But so it is; and truly as strange
 things may happen when a whole People goes mumming and miming.
 Hast not thou thyself perchance seen diademed Cleopatra, daughter
 of the Ptolemies, pleading, almost with bended knee, in unheroic
 tea-parlour, or dimlit retail-shop, to inflexible gross Burghal
 Dignitary, for leave to reign and die; being dressed for it, and
 moneyless, with small children;—while suddenly Constables have
 shut the Thespian barn, and her Antony pleaded in vain? Such
 visual spectra flit across this Earth, if the Thespian Stage be
 rudely interfered with: but much more, when, as was said, Pit
 jumps on Stage, then is it verily, as in Herr Tieck’s Drama, a
 _Verkehrte Welt_, of World Topsy-turvied! Having seen the Human Species itself, to have seen the “_Dean_ of
 the Human Species,” ceased now to be a miracle. Such “_Doyen du
 Genre Humain_, Eldest of Men,” had shewn himself there, in these
 weeks: Jean Claude Jacob, a born Serf, deputed from his native
 Jura Mountains to thank the National Assembly for enfranchising
 them. On his bleached worn face are ploughed the furrowings of
 one hundred and twenty years. He has heard dim _patois_-talk, of
 immortal Grand-Monarch victories; of a burnt Palatinate, as _he_
 toiled and moiled to make a little speck of this Earth greener;
 of Cevennes Dragoonings; of Marlborough going to the war. Four
 generations have bloomed out, and loved and hated, and rustled
 off: he was forty-six when Louis Fourteenth died. The Assembly,
 as one man, spontaneously rose, and did reverence to the Eldest
 of the World; old Jean is to take _séance_ among them,
 honourably, with covered head. He gazes feebly there, with his
 old eyes, on that new wonder-scene; dreamlike to him, and
 uncertain, wavering amid fragments of old memories and dreams.
 For Time is all growing unsubstantial, dreamlike; Jean’s eyes and
 mind are weary, and about to close,—and open on a far other
 wonder-scene, which shall be real. Patriot Subscription, Royal
 Pension was got for him, and he returned home glad; but in two
 months more he left it all, and went on his unknown way.[294]
 Chapter 2.1.XI.
 As in the Age of Gold. Meanwhile to Paris, ever going and returning, day after day, and
 all day long, towards that Field of Mars, it becomes painfully
 apparent that the spadework there cannot be got done in time.
 There is such an area of it; three hundred thousand square feet:
 for from the Ecole militaire (which will need to be done up in
 wood with balconies and galleries) westward to the Gate by the
 river (where also shall be wood, in triumphal arches), we count
 same thousand yards of length; and for breadth, from this
 umbrageous Avenue of eight rows, on the South side, to that
 corresponding one on the North, some thousand feet, more or less.
 All this to be scooped out, and wheeled up in slope along the
 sides; high enough; for it must be rammed down there, and shaped
 stair-wise into as many as “thirty ranges of convenient seats,”
 firm-trimmed with turf, covered with enduring timber;—and then
 our huge pyramidal Fatherland’s-Altar, _Autel de la Patrie_, in
 the centre, also to be raised and stair-stepped! Force-work with
 a vengeance; it is a World’s Amphitheatre! There are but fifteen
 days good; and at this languid rate, it might take half as many
 weeks. What is singular too, the spademen seem to work lazily;
 they will not work double-tides, even for offer of more wages,
 though their tide is but seven hours; they declare angrily that
 the human tabernacle requires occasional rest! Is it Aristocrats secretly bribing? Aristocrats were capable of
 that. Only six months since, did not evidence get afloat that
 subterranean Paris, for we stand over quarries and catacombs,
 dangerously, as it were midway between Heaven and the Abyss, and
 are hollow underground,—was charged with gunpowder, which should
 make us “leap?” Till a Cordelier’s Deputation actually went to
 examine, and found it—carried off again![295] An accursed,
 incurable brood; all asking for “passports,” in these sacred
 days. Trouble, of rioting, château-burning, is in the Limousin
 and elsewhere; for they are busy! Between the best of Peoples and
 the best of Restorer-Kings, they would sow grudges; with what a
 fiend’s-grin would they see this Federation, looked for by the
 Universe, fail!');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Fail for want of spadework, however, it shall not. He that has
 four limbs, and a French heart, can do spadework; and will! On
 the first July Monday, scarcely has the signal-cannon boomed;
 scarcely have the languescent mercenary Fifteen Thousand laid
 down their tools, and the eyes of onlookers turned sorrowfully of
 the still high Sun; when this and the other Patriot, fire in his
 eye, snatches barrow and mattock, and himself begins indignantly
 wheeling. Whom scores and then hundreds follow; and soon a
 volunteer Fifteen Thousand are shovelling and trundling; with the
 heart of giants; and all in right order, with that extemporaneous
 adroitness of theirs: whereby _such_ a lift has been given, worth
 three mercenary ones;—which may end when the late twilight
 thickens, in triumph shouts, heard or heard of beyond Montmartre! A sympathetic population will _wait_, next day, with eagerness,
 till the tools are free. Or why wait? Spades elsewhere exist! And
 so now bursts forth that effulgence of Parisian enthusiasm,
 good-heartedness and brotherly love; such, if Chroniclers are
 trustworthy, as was not witnessed since the Age of Gold. Paris,
 male and female, precipitates itself towards its South-west
 extremity, spade on shoulder. Streams of men, without order; or
 in order, as ranked fellow-craftsmen, as natural or accidental
 reunions, march towards the Field of Mars. Three-deep these
 march; to the sound of stringed music; preceded by young girls
 with green boughs, and tricolor streamers: they have shouldered,
 soldier-wise, their shovels and picks; and with one throat are
 singing _ça-ira_. Yes, _pardieu ça-ira_, cry the passengers on
 the streets. All corporate Guilds, and public and private Bodies
 of Citizens, from the highest to the lowest, march; the very
 Hawkers, one finds, have ceased bawling for one day. The
 neighbouring Villages turn out: their able men come marching, to
 village fiddle or tambourine and triangle, under their Mayor, or
 Mayor and Curate, who also walk bespaded, and in tricolor sash.
 As many as one hundred and fifty thousand workers: nay at certain
 seasons, as some count, two hundred and fifty thousand; for, in
 the afternoon especially, what mortal but, finishing his hasty
 day’s work, would run! A stirring city: from the time you reach
 the Place Louis Quinze, southward over the River, by all Avenues,
 it is one living throng. So many workers; and no mercenary
 mock-workers, but real ones that lie freely to it: each Patriot
 _stretches_ himself against the stubborn glebe; hews and wheels
 with the whole weight that is in him. Amiable infants, _aimables enfans!_ They do the “_police des
 l’atelier_” too, the guidance and governance, themselves; with
 that ready will of theirs, with that extemporaneous adroitness.
 It is a true brethren’s work; all distinctions confounded,
 abolished; as it was in the beginning, when Adam himself delved.
 Longfrocked tonsured Monks, with short-skirted Water-carriers,
 with swallow-tailed well-frizzled _Incroyables_ of a Patriot
 turn; dark Charcoalmen, meal-white Peruke-makers; or
 Peruke-wearers, for Advocate and Judge are there, and all Heads
 of Districts: sober Nuns sisterlike with flaunting Nymphs of the
 Opera, and females in common circumstances named unfortunate: the
 patriot Rag-picker, and perfumed dweller in palaces; for
 Patriotism like New-birth, and also like Death, levels all. The
 Printers have come marching, Prudhomme’s all in Paper-caps with
 _Révolutions de Paris_ printed on them; as Camille notes; wishing
 that in these great days there should be a _Pacte des Ecrivains_
 too, or Federation of Able Editors.[296] Beautiful to see! The
 snowy linen and delicate pantaloon alternates with the soiled
 check-shirt and bushel-breeches; for both have cast their coats,
 and under both are four limbs and a set of Patriot muscles. There
 do they pick and shovel; or bend forward, yoked in long strings
 to box-barrow or overloaded tumbril; joyous, with one mind. Abbé
 Sieyes is seen pulling, wiry, vehement, if too light for draught;
 by the side of Beauharnais, who shall get Kings though he be
 none. Abbé Maury did not pull; but the Charcoalmen brought a
 mummer guised like him, so he had to pull in effigy. Let no
 august Senator disdain the work: Mayor Bailly, Generalissimo
 Lafayette are there;—and, alas, shall be there again another day!
 The King himself comes to see: sky-rending _Vive-le-Roi;_ “and
 suddenly with shouldered spades they form a guard of honour round
 him.” Whosoever can come comes, to work, or to look, and bless
 the work. Whole families have come. One whole family we see clearly, of
 three generations: the father picking, the mother shovelling, the
 young ones wheeling assiduous; old grandfather, hoary with
 ninety-three years, holds in his arms the youngest of all:[297]
 frisky, not helpful this one; who nevertheless may tell it to
 _his_ grandchildren; and how the Future and the Past alike looked
 on, and with failing or with half-formed voice, faltered their
 _ça-ira_. A vintner has wheeled in, on Patriot truck, beverage of
 wine: ‘Drink not, my brothers, if ye are not dry; that your cask
 may last the longer;’ neither did any drink, but men “evidently
 exhausted.” A dapper Abbé looks on, sneering. ‘To the barrow!’
 cry several; whom he, lest a worse thing befal him, obeys:
 nevertheless one wiser Patriot barrowman, arriving now,
 interposes his ‘_arrêtez;_’ setting down his own barrow, he
 snatches the Abbé’s; trundles it fast, like an infected thing;
 forth of the Champ-de-Mars circuit, and discharges it _there_.
 Thus too a certain person (of some quality, or private capital,
 to appearance), entering hastily, flings down his coat, waistcoat
 and two watches, and is rushing to the thick of the work: ‘But
 your watches?’ cries the general voice.—‘Does one distrust his
 brothers?’ answers he; nor were the watches stolen. How beautiful
 is noble-sentiment: like gossamer gauze, beautiful and cheap;
 which will stand no tear and wear! Beautiful cheap gossamer
 gauze, thou film-shadow of a raw-material of Virtue, which art
 not woven, nor likely to be, into Duty; thou art better than
 nothing, and also worse! Young Boarding-school Boys, College Students, shout _Vive la
 Nation_, and regret that they have yet “only their sweat to
 give.” What say we of Boys? Beautifullest Hebes; the loveliest of
 Paris, in their light air-robes, with riband-girdle of tricolor,
 are there; shovelling and wheeling with the rest; their Hebe eyes
 brighter with enthusiasm, and long hair in beautiful
 dishevelment: hard-pressed are their small fingers; but they make
 the patriot barrow go, and even force it to the summit of the
 slope (with a little tracing, which what man’s arm were not too
 happy to lend?)—then bound down with it again, and go for more;
 with their long locks and tricolors blown back: graceful as the
 rosy Hours. O, as that evening Sun fell over the Champ-de-Mars,
 and tinted with fire the thick umbrageous boscage that shelters
 it on this hand and on that, and struck direct on those Domes and
 two-and-forty Windows of the Ecole Militaire, and made them all
 of burnished gold,—saw he on his wide zodiac road other such
 sight? A living garden spotted and dotted with such flowerage;
 all colours of the prism; the beautifullest blent friendly with
 the usefullest; all growing and working brotherlike there, under
 one warm feeling, were it but for days; once and no second time!
 But Night is sinking; these Nights too, into Eternity. The
 hastiest Traveller Versailles-ward has drawn bridle on the
 heights of Chaillot: and looked for moments over the River;
 reporting at Versailles what he saw, not without tears.[298] Meanwhile, from all points of the compass, Federates are
 arriving: fervid children of the South, “who glory in their
 Mirabeau;” considerate North-blooded Mountaineers of Jura; sharp
 Bretons, with their Gaelic suddenness; Normans not to be
 overreached in bargain: all now animated with one noblest fire of
 Patriotism. Whom the Paris brethren march forth to receive; with
 military solemnities, with fraternal embracing, and a hospitality
 worthy of the heroic ages. They assist at the Assembly’s Debates,
 these Federates: the Galleries are reserved for them. They assist
 in the toils of the Champ-de-Mars; each new troop will put its
 hand to the spade; lift a hod of earth on the Altar of the
 Fatherland. But the flourishes of rhetoric, for it is a
 gesticulating People; the moral-sublime of those Addresses to an
 august Assembly, to a Patriot Restorer! Our Breton Captain of
 Federates kneels even, in a fit of enthusiasm, and gives up his
 sword; he wet-eyed to a King wet-eyed. Poor Louis! These, as he
 said afterwards, were among the bright days of his life. Reviews also there must be; royal Federate-reviews, with King,
 Queen and tricolor Court looking on: at lowest, if, as is too
 common, it rains, our Federate Volunteers will file through the
 inner gateways, Royalty standing dry. Nay there, should some stop
 occur, the beautifullest fingers in France may take you softly by
 the lapelle, and, in mild flute-voice, ask: ‘Monsieur, of what
 Province are you?’ Happy he who can reply, chivalrously lowering
 his sword’s point, ‘Madame, from the Province your ancestors
 reigned over.’ He that happy “Provincial Advocate,” now
 Provincial Federate, shall be rewarded by a sun-smile, and such
 melodious glad words addressed to a King: ‘Sire, these are your
 faithful Lorrainers.’ Cheerier verily, in these holidays, is this
 “skyblue faced with red” of a National Guardsman, than the dull
 black and gray of a Provincial Advocate, which in workdays one
 was used to. For the same thrice-blessed Lorrainer shall, this
 evening, stand sentry at a Queen’s door; and feel that he could
 die a thousand deaths for her: then again, at the outer gate, and
 even a third time, she shall see him; nay he will make her do it;
 presenting arms with emphasis, “making his musket jingle again”:
 and in her salute there shall again be a sun-smile, and that
 little blonde-locked too hasty Dauphin shall be admonished,
 ‘Salute then, Monsieur, don’t be unpolite;’ and therewith she,
 like a bright Sky-wanderer or Planet with her little Moon, issues
 forth peculiar.[299] But at night, when Patriot spadework is over, figure the sacred
 rights of hospitality! Lepelletier Saint-Fargeau, a mere private
 senator, but with great possessions, has daily his “hundred
 dinner-guests;” the table of Generalissimo Lafayette may double
 that number. In lowly parlour, as in lofty saloon, the wine-cup
 passes round; crowned by the smiles of Beauty; be it of
 lightly-tripping Grisette, or of high-sailing Dame, for both
 equally have beauty, and smiles precious to the brave.
 Chapter 2.1.XII.
 Sound and Smoke. And so now, in spite of plotting Aristocrats, lazy hired
 spademen, and almost of Destiny itself (for there has been much
 rain), the Champ-de-Mars, on the 13th of the month is fairly
 ready; trimmed, rammed, buttressed with firm masonry; and
 Patriotism can stroll over it admiring; and as it were
 rehearsing, for in every head is some unutterable image of the
 morrow. Pray Heaven there be not clouds. Nay what far worse cloud
 is this, of a misguided Municipality that talks of admitting
 Patriotism, to the solemnity, by tickets! Was it by tickets we
 were admitted to the work; and to what brought the work? Did we
 take the Bastille by tickets? A misguided Municipality sees the
 error; at late midnight, rolling drums announce to Patriotism
 starting half out of its bed-clothes, that it is to be
 ticketless. Pull down thy night-cap therefore; and, with
 demi-articulate grumble, significant of several things, go
 pacified to sleep again. Tomorrow is Wednesday morning;
 unforgetable among the _fasti_ of the world. The morning comes, cold for a July one; but such a festivity
 would make Greenland smile. Through every inlet of that National
 Amphitheatre (for it is a league in circuit, cut with openings at
 due intervals), floods-in the living throng; covers without
 tumult space after space. The Ecole Militaire has galleries and
 overvaulting canopies, where Carpentry and Painting have vied,
 for the upper Authorities; triumphal arches, at the Gate by the
 River, bear inscriptions, if weak, yet well-meant, and orthodox.
 Far aloft, over the Altar of the Fatherland, on their tall crane
 standards of iron, swing pensile our antique _Cassolettes_ or
 pans of incense; dispensing sweet incense-fumes,—unless for the
 Heathen Mythology, one sees not for whom. Two hundred thousand
 Patriotic Men; and, twice as good, one hundred thousand Patriotic
 Women, all decked and glorified as one can fancy, sit waiting in
 this Champ-de-Mars. What a picture: that circle of bright-eyed Life, spread up there,
 on its thirty-seated Slope; leaning, one would say, on the thick
 umbrage of those Avenue-Trees, for the stems of them are hidden
 by the height; and all beyond it mere greenness of Summer Earth,
 with the gleams of waters, or white sparklings of stone-edifices:
 little circular enamel-picture in the centre of such a vase—of
 emerald! A vase not empty: the Invalides Cupolas want not their
 population, nor the distant Windmills of Montmartre; on remotest
 steeple and invisible village belfry, stand men with spy-glasses.
 On the heights of Chaillot are many-coloured undulating groups;
 round and far on, over all the circling heights that embosom
 Paris, it is as one more or less peopled Amphitheatre; which the
 eye grows dim with measuring. Nay heights, as was before hinted,
 have cannon; and a floating-battery of cannon is on the Seine.
 When eye fails, ear shall serve; and all France properly is but
 one Amphitheatre: for in paved town and unpaved hamlet, men walk
 listening; till the muffled thunder sound audible on their
 horizon, that they too may begin swearing and firing![300] But
 now, to streams of music, come Federates enough,—for they have
 assembled on the Boulevard Saint-Antoine or thereby, and come
 marching through the City, with their Eighty-three Department
 Banners, and blessings not loud but deep; comes National
 Assembly, and takes seat under its Canopy; comes Royalty, and
 takes seat on a throne beside it. And Lafayette, on white
 charger, is here, and all the civic Functionaries; and the
 Federates form dances, till their strictly military evolutions
 and manœuvres can begin. Evolutions and manœuvres? Task not the pen of mortal to describe
 them: truant imagination droops;—declares that it is not worth
 while. There is wheeling and sweeping, to slow, to quick, and
 double quick-time: Sieur Motier, or Generalissimo Lafayette, for
 they are one and the same, and he is General of France, in the
 King’s stead, for four-and-twenty hours; Sieur Motier must step
 forth, with that sublime chivalrous gait of his; solemnly ascend
 the steps of the Fatherland’s Altar, in sight of Heaven and of
 the scarcely breathing Earth; and, under the creak of those
 swinging _Cassolettes_, “pressing his sword’s point firmly
 there,” pronounce the Oath, _To King, to Law, and Nation_ (not to
 mention “grains” with their circulating), in his own name and
 that of armed France. Whereat there is waving of banners and
 acclaim sufficient. The National Assembly must swear, standing in
 its place; the King himself audibly. The King swears; and now
 _be_ the welkin split with vivats; let citizens enfranchised
 embrace, each smiting heartily his palm into his fellow’s; and
 armed Federates clang their arms; above all, that floating
 battery speak! It has spoken,—to the four corners of France. From
 eminence to eminence, bursts the thunder; faint-heard,
 loud-repeated. What a stone, cast into what a lake; in circles
 that do _not_ grow fainter. From Arras to Avignon; from Metz to
 Bayonne! Over Orléans and Blois it rolls, in cannon-recitative;
 Puy bellows of it amid his granite mountains; Pau where is the
 shell-cradle of Great Henri. At far Marseilles, one can think,
 the ruddy evening witnesses it; over the deep-blue Mediterranean
 waters, the Castle of If ruddy-tinted darts forth, from every
 cannon’s mouth, its tongue of fire; and all the people shout:
 Yes, France is free. O glorious France that has burst out so;
 into universal sound and smoke; and attained—the Phrygian _Cap_
 of Liberty! In all Towns, Trees of Liberty also may be planted;
 with or without advantage. Said we not, it is the highest stretch
 attained by the Thespian Art on this Planet, or perhaps
 attainable? The Thespian Art, unfortunately, one must still call it; for
 behold there, on this Field of Mars, the National Banners, before
 there could be any swearing, were to be all blessed. A most
 proper operation; since surely without Heaven’s blessing
 bestowed, say even, audibly or inaudibly _sought_, no Earthly
 banner or contrivance can prove victorious: but now the means of
 doing it? By what thrice-divine Franklin thunder-rod shall
 miraculous fire be drawn out of Heaven; and descend gently,
 life-giving, with health to the souls of men? Alas, by the
 simplest: by Two Hundred shaven-crowned Individuals, “in
 snow-white albs, with tricolor girdles,” arranged on the steps of
 Fatherland’s Altar; and, at their head for spokesman, Soul’s
 Overseer Talleyrand-Perigord! These shall act as miraculous
 thunder-rod,—to such length as they can. O ye deep azure Heavens,
 and thou green all-nursing Earth; ye Streams ever-flowing;
 deciduous Forests that die and are born again, continually, like
 the sons of men; stone Mountains that die daily with every
 rain-shower, yet are not dead and levelled for ages of ages, nor
 born again (it seems) but with new world-explosions, and such
 tumultuous seething and tumbling, steam half way to the Moon; O
 thou unfathomable mystic All, garment and dwellingplace of the
 UNNAMED; O spirit, lastly, of Man, who mouldest and modellest
 that Unfathomable Unnameable even as we see,—is not _there_ a
 miracle: That some French mortal should, we say not have
 believed, but pretended to imagine that he believed that
 Talleyrand and Two Hundred pieces of white Calico could do it! Here, however, we are to remark with the sorrowing Historians of
 that day, that suddenly, while Episcopus Talleyrand, long-stoled,
 with mitre and tricolor belt, was yet but hitching up the
 Altar-steps, to do his miracle, the material Heaven grew black; a
 north-wind, moaning cold moisture, began to sing; and there
 descended a very deluge of rain. Sad to see! The thirty-staired
 Seats, all round our Amphitheatre, get instantaneously slated
 with mere umbrellas, fallacious when so thick set: our antique
 _Cassolettes_ become Water-pots; their incense-smoke gone
 hissing, in a whiff of muddy vapour. Alas, instead of vivats,
 there is nothing now but the furious peppering and rattling. From
 three to four hundred thousand human individuals feel that they
 have a skin; happily _im_pervious. The General’s sash runs water:
 how all military banners droop; and will not wave, but lazily
 flap, as if metamorphosed into painted tin-banners! Worse, far
 worse, these hundred thousand, such is the Historian’s testimony,
 of the fairest of France! Their snowy muslins all splashed and
 draggled; the ostrich feather shrunk shamefully to the backbone
 of a feather: all caps are ruined; innermost pasteboard molten
 into its original pap: Beauty no longer swims decorated in her
 garniture, like Love-goddess hidden-revealed in her Paphian
 clouds, but struggles in disastrous imprisonment in it, for “the
 shape was noticeable;” and now only sympathetic interjections,
 titterings, teeheeings, and resolute good-humour will avail. A
 deluge; an incessant sheet or fluid-column of rain;—such that our
 Overseer’s very mitre must be filled; not a mitre, but a filled
 and leaky fire-bucket on his reverend head!—Regardless of which,
 Overseer Talleyrand performs his miracle: the Blessing of
 Talleyrand, another than that of Jacob, is on all the
 Eighty-three departmental flags of France; which wave or flap,
 with such thankfulness as needs. Towards three o’clock, the sun
 beams out again: the remaining evolutions can be transacted under
 bright heavens, though with decorations much damaged.[301] On Wednesday our Federation is consummated: but the festivities
 last out the week, and over into the next. Festivities such as no
 Bagdad Caliph, or Aladdin with the Lamp, could have equalled.
 There is a Jousting on the River; with its water-somersets,
 splashing and haha-ing: Abbé Fauchet, _Te-Deum_ Fauchet,
 preaches, for his part, in “the rotunda of the Corn-market,” a
 Harangue on Franklin; for whom the National Assembly has lately
 gone three days in black. The Motier and Lepelletier tables still
 groan with viands; roofs ringing with patriotic toasts. On the
 fifth evening, which is the Christian Sabbath, there is a
 universal Ball. Paris, out of doors and in, man, woman and child,
 is jigging it, to the sound of harp and four-stringed fiddle. The
 hoariest-headed man will tread one other measure, under this
 nether Moon; speechless nurselings, _infants_ as we call them,
 νήπια τέκνα, crow in arms; and sprawl out numb-plump little
 limbs,—impatient for muscularity, they know not why. The stiffest
 balk bends more or less; all joists creak. Or out, on the Earth’s breast itself, behold the Ruins of the
 Bastille. All lamplit, allegorically decorated: a Tree of Liberty
 sixty feet high; and Phrygian Cap on it, of size enormous, under
 which King Arthur and his round-table might have dined! In the
 depths of the background, is a single lugubrious lamp, rendering
 dim-visible one of your iron cages, half-buried, and some Prison
 stones,—Tyranny vanishing downwards, all gone but the skirt: the
 rest wholly lamp-festoons, trees real or of pasteboard; in the
 similitude of a fairy grove; with this inscription, readable to
 runner: “_Ici l’on danse_, Dancing Here.” As indeed had been
 obscurely foreshadowed by Cagliostro[302] prophetic Quack of
 Quacks, when he, four years ago, quitted the grim durance;—to
 fall into a grimmer, of the Roman Inquisition, and not quit it. But, after all, what is this Bastille business to that of the
 _Champs Elysées!_ Thither, to these Fields well named Elysian,
 all feet tend. It is radiant as day with festooned lamps; little
 oil-cups, like variegated fire-flies, daintily illumine the
 highest leaves: trees there are all sheeted with variegated fire,
 shedding far a glimmer into the dubious wood. There, under the
 free sky, do tight-limbed Federates, with fairest newfound
 sweethearts, elastic as Diana, and not of that coyness and tart
 humour of Diana, thread their jocund mazes, all through the
 ambrosial night; and hearts were touched and fired; and seldom
 surely had our old Planet, in that huge conic Shadow of hers
 “which goes beyond the Moon, and is named _Night_,” curtained
 such a Ball-room. O if, according to Seneca, the very gods look
 down on a good man struggling with adversity, and smile; what
 must they think of Five-and-twenty million indifferent ones
 victorious over it,—for eight days and more? In this way, and in such ways, however, has the Feast of Pikes
 danced itself off; gallant Federates wending homewards, towards
 every point of the compass, with feverish nerves, heart and head
 much heated; some of them, indeed, as Dampmartin’s elderly
 respectable friend, from Strasbourg, quite “burnt out with
 liquors,” and flickering towards extinction.[303] The Feast of
 Pikes has danced itself off, and become defunct, and the ghost of
 a Feast;—nothing of it now remaining but this vision in men’s
 memory; and the place that knew it (for the slope of that
 Champ-de-Mars is crumbled to half the original height[304]) now
 knowing it no more. Undoubtedly one of the memorablest National
 Hightides. Never or hardly ever, as we said, was Oath sworn with
 such heart-effusion, emphasis and expenditure of joyance; and
 then it was broken irremediably within year and day. Ah, why?
 When the swearing of it was so heavenly-joyful, bosom clasped to
 bosom, and Five-and-twenty million hearts all burning together: O
 ye inexorable Destinies, why?—Partly _because_ it was sworn with
 such over-joyance; but chiefly, indeed, for an older reason: that
 Sin had come into the world and Misery by Sin! These
 Five-and-twenty millions, if we will consider it, have now
 henceforth, with that Phrygian Cap of theirs, no force _over_
 them, to bind and guide; neither in them, more than heretofore,
 is guiding force, or rule of just living: how then, while they
 all go rushing at such a _pace_, on unknown ways, with no bridle,
 towards no aim, can hurlyburly unutterable fail? For verily not
 Federation-rosepink is the colour of this Earth and her work: not
 by outbursts of noble-sentiment, but with far other ammunition,
 shall a man front the world. But how wise, in all cases, to “husband your fire;” to keep it
 deep down, rather, as genial radical-heat! Explosions, the
 forciblest, and never so well directed, are questionable; far
 oftenest futile, always frightfully wasteful: but think of a man,
 of a Nation of men, spending its whole stock of fire in one
 artificial Firework! So have we seen fond weddings (for
 individuals, like Nations, have their Hightides) celebrated with
 an outburst of triumph and deray, at which the elderly shook
 their heads. Better had a serious cheerfulness been; for the
 enterprise was great. Fond pair! the more triumphant ye feel, and
 victorious over terrestrial evil, which seems all abolished, the
 wider-eyed will your disappointment be to find terrestrial evil
 still extant. ‘And why extant?’ will each of you cry: ‘Because my
 false mate has played the traitor: evil was abolished; I meant
 faithfully, and did, or would have done.’ Whereby the oversweet
 moon of honey changes itself into long years of vinegar; perhaps
 divulsive vinegar, like Hannibal’s. Shall we say then, the French Nation has led Royalty, or wooed
 and teased poor Royalty to lead _her_, to the hymeneal
 Fatherland’s Altar, in such oversweet manner; and has, most
 thoughtlessly, to celebrate the nuptials with due shine and
 demonstration,—burnt her bed?

 Bouillé. Dimly visible, at Metz on the North-Eastern frontier, a certain
 brave Bouillé, last refuge of Royalty in all straits and
 meditations of flight, has for many months hovered occasionally
 in our eye; some name or shadow of a brave Bouillé: let us now,
 for a little, look fixedly at him, till he become a substance and
 person for us. The man himself is worth a glance; his position
 and procedure there, in these days, will throw light on many
 things. For it is with Bouillé as with all French Commanding Officers;
 only in a more emphatic degree. The grand National Federation, we
 already guess, was but empty sound, or worse: a last loudest
 universal _Hep-hep-hurrah_, with full bumpers, in that National
 Lapithae-feast of Constitution-making; as in loud denial of the
 palpably existing; as if, with hurrahings, you would shut out
 notice of the inevitable already knocking at the gates! Which new
 National bumper, one may say, can but deepen the drunkenness; and
 so, the _louder_ it swears Brotherhood, will the sooner and the
 more surely lead to Cannibalism. Ah, under that fraternal shine
 and clangour, what a deep world of irreconcileable discords lie
 momentarily assuaged, damped down for one moment! Respectable
 military Federates have barely got home to their quarters; and
 the inflammablest, “dying, burnt up with liquors, and kindness,”
 has not yet got extinct; the shine is hardly out of men’s eyes,
 and still blazes filling all men’s memories,—when your discords
 burst forth again very considerably darker than ever. Let us look
 at Bouillé, and see how. Bouillé for the present commands in the Garrison of Metz, and far
 and wide over the East and North; being indeed, by a late act of
 Government with sanction of National Assembly, appointed one of
 our Four supreme Generals. Rochambeau and Mailly, men and
 Marshals of note in these days, though to us of small moment, are
 two of his colleagues; tough old babbling Lückner, also of small
 moment for us, will probably be the third. Marquis de Bouillé is
 a determined Loyalist; not indeed disinclined to moderate reform,
 but resolute against immoderate. A man long suspect to
 Patriotism; who has more than once given the august Assembly
 trouble; who would not, for example, take the National Oath, as
 he was bound to do, but always put it off on this or the other
 pretext, till an autograph of Majesty requested him to do it as a
 favour. There, in this post if not of honour, yet of eminence and
 danger, he waits, in a silent concentered manner; very dubious of
 the future. “Alone,” as he says, or almost alone, of all the old
 military Notabilities, he has not emigrated; but thinks always,
 in atrabiliar moments, that there will be nothing for him too but
 to cross the marches. He might cross, say, to Treves or Coblentz
 where Exiled Princes will be one day ranking; or say, over into
 Luxemburg where old Broglie loiters and languishes. Or is there
 not the great dim Deep of European Diplomacy; where your
 Calonnes, your Bréteuils are beginning to hover, dimly
 discernible? With immeasurable confused outlooks and purposes, with no clear
 purpose but this of still trying to do His Majesty a service,
 Bouillé waits; struggling what he can to keep his district loyal,
 his troops faithful, his garrisons furnished. He maintains, as
 yet, with his Cousin Lafayette, some thin diplomatic
 correspondence, by letter and messenger; chivalrous
 constitutional professions on the one side, military gravity and
 brevity on the other; which thin correspondence one can see
 growing ever the thinner and hollower, towards the verge of
 entire vacuity.[305] A quick, choleric, sharply discerning,
 stubbornly endeavouring man; with suppressed-explosive
 resolution, with valour, nay headlong audacity: a man who was
 more in his place, lionlike defending those Windward Isles, or,
 as with military tiger-spring, clutching Nevis and Montserrat
 from the English,—than here in this suppressed condition, muzzled
 and fettered by diplomatic packthreads; looking out for a civil
 war, which may never arrive. Few years ago Bouillé was to have
 led a French East-Indian Expedition, and reconquered or conquered
 Pondicherri and the Kingdoms of the Sun: but the whole world is
 suddenly changed, and he with it; Destiny willed it not in that
 way but in this.

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Indeed, as to the general outlook of things, Bouillé himself
 augurs not well of it. The French Army, ever since those old
 Bastille days, and earlier, has been universally in the
 questionablest state, and growing daily worse. Discipline, which
 is at all times a kind of miracle, and works by faith, broke down
 then; one sees not with that near prospect of recovering itself.
 The Gardes Françaises played a deadly game; but how they won it,
 and wear the prizes of it, all men know. In that general
 overturn, we saw the Hired Fighters refuse to fight. The very
 Swiss of Château-Vieux, which indeed is a kind of French Swiss,
 from Geneva and the Pays de Vaud, are understood to have
 declined. Deserters glided over; Royal-Allemand itself looked
 disconsolate, though stanch of purpose. In a word, we there saw
 _Military Rule_, in the shape of poor Besenval with that
 convulsive unmanageable Camp of his, pass two martyr days on the
 Champ-de-Mars; and then, veiling itself, so to speak, “under the
 cloud of night,” depart “down the left bank of the Seine,” to
 seek refuge elsewhere; _this_ ground having clearly become too
 hot for it. But what new ground to seek, what remedy to try? Quarters that
 were “uninfected:” this doubtless, with judicious strictness of
 drilling, were the plan. Alas, in all quarters and places, from
 Paris onward to the remotest hamlet, is infection, is seditious
 contagion: inhaled, propagated by contact and converse, till the
 dullest soldier catch it! There is speech of men in uniform with
 men not in uniform; men in uniform read journals, and even write
 in them.[306] There are public petitions or remonstrances,
 private emissaries and associations; there is discontent,
 jealousy, uncertainty, sullen suspicious humour. The whole French
 Army, fermenting in dark heat, glooms ominous, boding good to no
 one. So that, in the general social dissolution and revolt, we are to
 have this deepest and dismallest kind of it, a revolting
 soldiery? Barren, desolate to look upon is this same business of
 revolt under all its aspects; but how infinitely more so, when it
 takes the aspect of military mutiny! The very implement of rule
 and restraint, whereby all the rest was managed and held in
 order, has become precisely the frightfullest immeasurable
 implement of misrule; like the element of Fire, our indispensable
 all-ministering servant, when it gets the _mastery_, and becomes
 conflagration. Discipline we called a kind of miracle: in fact,
 is it not miraculous how one man moves hundreds of thousands;
 each unit of whom it may be loves him not, and singly fears him
 not, yet has to obey him, to go hither or go thither, to march
 and halt, to give death, and even to receive it, as if a Fate had
 spoken; and the word-of-command becomes, almost in the literal
 sense, a magic-word? Which magic-word, again, if it be once _forgotten;_ the spell of
 it once broken! The legions of assiduous ministering spirits rise
 on you now as menacing fiends; your free orderly arena becomes a
 tumult-place of the Nether Pit, and the hapless magician is rent
 limb from limb. Military mobs are mobs with muskets in their
 hands; and also with death hanging over their heads, for death is
 the penalty of disobedience and they have disobeyed. And now if
 all mobs are properly frenzies, and work frenetically with mad
 fits of hot and of cold, fierce rage alternating so incoherently
 with panic terror, consider what your military mob will be, with
 such a conflict of duties and penalties, whirled between remorse
 and fury, and, for the hot fit, loaded fire-arms in its hand! To
 the soldier himself, revolt is frightful, and oftenest perhaps
 pitiable; and yet so dangerous, it can only be hated, cannot be
 pitied. An anomalous class of mortals these poor Hired Killers!
 With a frankness, which to the Moralist in these times seems
 surprising, they have sworn to become machines; and nevertheless
 they are still partly men. Let no prudent person in authority
 remind them of this latter fact; but always let force, let
 injustice above all, stop short clearly on _this_ side of the
 rebounding-point! Soldiers, as we often say, do revolt: were it
 not so, several things which are transient in this world might be
 perennial. Over and above the general quarrel which all sons of Adam
 maintain with their lot here below, the grievances of the French
 soldiery reduce themselves to two, First that their Officers are
 Aristocrats; secondly that they cheat them of their Pay. Two
 grievances; or rather we might say one, capable of becoming a
 hundred; for in that single first proposition, that the Officers
 are Aristocrats, what a multitude of corollaries lie ready! It is
 a bottomless ever-flowing fountain of grievances this; what you
 may call a general raw-material of grievance, wherefrom
 individual grievance after grievance will daily body itself
 forth. Nay there will even be a kind of comfort in getting it,
 from time to time, so embodied. Peculation of one’s Pay! It is
 embodied; made tangible, made denounceable; exhalable, if only in
 angry words. For unluckily that grand fountain of grievances does exist:
 Aristocrats almost all our Officers necessarily are; they have it
 in the blood and bone. By the law of the case, no man can pretend
 to be the pitifullest lieutenant of militia, till he have first
 verified, to the satisfaction of the Lion-King, a Nobility of
 four generations. Not Nobility only, but four generations of it:
 this latter is the improvement hit upon, in comparatively late
 years, by a certain War-minister much pressed for
 commissions.[307] An improvement which did relieve the
 over-pressed War-minister, but which split France still further
 into yawning contrasts of Commonalty and Nobility, nay of new
 Nobility and old; as if already with your new and old, and then
 with your old, older and oldest, there were not contrasts and
 discrepancies enough;—the general clash whereof men now see and
 hear, and in the singular whirlpool, all contrasts gone together
 to the bottom! Gone to the bottom or going; with uproar, without
 return; going every where save in the Military section of things;
 and there, it may be asked, can they hope to continue always at
 the top? Apparently, not. It is true, in a time of external Peace, when there is no
 fighting but only drilling, this question, How you rise from the
 ranks, may seem theoretical rather. But in reference to the
 Rights of Man it is continually practical. The soldier has sworn
 to be faithful not to the King only, but to the Law and the
 Nation. Do our commanders love the Revolution? ask all soldiers.
 Unhappily no, they hate it, and love the Counter-Revolution.
 Young epauletted men, with quality-blood in them, poisoned with
 quality-pride, do sniff openly, with indignation struggling to
 become contempt, at our Rights of Man, as at some newfangled
 cobweb, which shall be brushed down again. Old officers, more
 cautious, keep silent, with closed uncurled lips; but one guesses
 what is passing within. Nay who knows, how, under the plausiblest
 word of command, might lie Counter-Revolution itself, sale to
 Exiled Princes and the Austrian Kaiser: treacherous Aristocrats
 hoodwinking the small insight of us common men?—In such manner
 works that general raw-material of grievance; disastrous; instead
 of trust and reverence, breeding hate, endless suspicion, the
 impossibility of commanding and obeying. And now when this second
 more tangible grievance has articulated itself universally in the
 mind of the common man: Peculation of his Pay! Peculation of the
 despicablest sort does exist, and has long existed; but, unless
 the new-declared Rights of Man, and all rights whatsoever, be a
 cobweb, it shall no longer exist. The French Military System seems dying a sorrowful suicidal
 death. Nay more, citizen, as is natural, ranks himself against
 citizen in this cause. The soldier finds audience, of numbers and
 sympathy unlimited, among the Patriot lower-classes. Nor are the
 higher wanting to the officer. The officer still dresses and
 perfumes himself for such sad unemigrated _soirée_ as there may
 still be; and speaks his woes,—which woes, are they not Majesty’s
 and Nature’s? Speaks, at the same time, his gay defiance, his
 firm-set resolution. Citizens, still more Citizenesses, see the
 right and the wrong; not the Military System alone will die by
 suicide, but much along with it. As was said, there is yet
 possible a deepest overturn than any yet witnessed: that deepest
 _up_turn of the black-burning sulphurous stratum whereon all
 rests and grows! But how these things may act on the rude soldier-mind, with its
 military pedantries, its inexperience of all that lies off the
 parade-ground; inexperience as of a child, yet fierceness of a
 man and vehemence of a Frenchman! It is long that secret
 communings in mess-room and guard-room, sour looks, thousandfold
 petty vexations between commander and commanded, measure every
 where the weary military day. Ask Captain Dampmartin; an
 authentic, ingenious literary officer of horse; who loves the
 Reign of Liberty, after a sort; yet has had his heart grieved to
 the quick many times, in the hot South-Western region and
 elsewhere; and has seen riot, civil battle by daylight and by
 torchlight, and anarchy hatefuller than death. How insubordinate
 Troopers, with drink in their heads, meet Captain Dampmartin and
 another on the ramparts, where there is no escape or side-path;
 and make military salute punctually, for we look calm on them;
 yet make it in a snappish, almost insulting manner: how one
 morning they “leave all their chamois shirts” and superfluous
 buffs, which they are tired of, laid in piles at the Captain’s
 doors; whereat “we laugh,” as the ass does, eating thistles: nay
 how they “knot two forage-cords together,” with universal noisy
 cursing, with evident intent to hang the Quarter-master:—all this
 the worthy Captain, looking on it through the ruddy-and-sable of
 fond regretful memory, has flowingly written down.[308] Men growl
 in vague discontent; officers fling up their commissions, and
 emigrate in disgust. Or let us ask another literary Officer; not yet Captain;
 Sublieutenant only, in the Artillery Regiment La Fère: a young
 man of twenty-one; not unentitled to speak; the name of him is
 _Napoleon Buonaparte._ To such height of Sublieutenancy has he
 now got promoted, from Brienne School, five years ago; “being
 found qualified in mathematics by La Place.” He is lying at
 Auxonne, in the West, in these months; not sumptuously lodged—“in
 the house of a Barber, to whose wife he did not pay the customary
 degree of respect;” or even over at the Pavilion, in a chamber
 with bare walls; the only furniture an indifferent “bed without
 curtains, two chairs, and in the recess of a window a table
 covered with books and papers: his Brother Louis sleeps on a
 coarse mattrass in an adjoining room.” However, he is doing
 something great: writing his first Book or Pamphlet,—eloquent
 vehement _Letter to M. Matteo Buttafuoco_, our Corsican Deputy,
 who is not a Patriot but an Aristocrat, unworthy of Deputyship.
 Joly of Dôle is Publisher. The literary Sublieutenant corrects
 the proofs; “sets out on foot from Auxonne, every morning at four
 o’clock, for Dôle: after looking over the proofs, he partakes of
 an extremely frugal breakfast with Joly, and immediately prepares
 for returning to his Garrison; where he arrives before noon,
 having thus walked above twenty miles in the course of the
 morning.” This Sublieutenant can remark that, in drawing-rooms, on streets,
 on highways, at inns, every where men’s minds are ready to kindle
 into a flame. That a Patriot, if he appear in the drawing-room,
 or amid a group of officers, is liable enough to be discouraged,
 so great is the majority against him: but no sooner does he get
 into the street, or among the soldiers, than he feels again as if
 the whole Nation were with him. That after the famous Oath, _To
 the King, to the Nation and Law_, there was a great change; that
 before this, if ordered to fire on the people, he for one would
 have done it in the King’s name; but that after this, in the
 Nation’s name, he would not have done it. Likewise that the
 Patriot officers, more numerous too in the Artillery and
 Engineers than elsewhere, were few in number; yet that having the
 soldiers on their side, they ruled the regiment; and did often
 deliver the Aristocrat brother officer out of peril and strait.
 One day, for example, “a member of our own mess roused the mob,
 by singing, from the windows of our dining-room, _O Richard, O my
 King;_ and I had to snatch him from their fury.”[309] All which let the reader multiply by ten thousand; and spread it
 with slight variations over all the camps and garrisons of
 France. The French Army seems on the verge of universal mutiny. Universal mutiny! There is in that what may well make Patriot
 Constitutionalism and an august Assembly shudder. Something
 behoves to be done; yet what to do no man can tell. Mirabeau
 proposes even that the Soldiery, having come to such a pass, be
 forthwith disbanded, the whole Two Hundred and Eighty Thousands
 of them; and organised anew.[310] Impossible this, in so sudden a
 manner! cry all men. And yet literally, answer we, it is
 inevitable, in one manner or another. Such an Army, with its
 four-generation Nobles, its Peculated Pay, and men knotting
 forage cords to hang their quartermaster, cannot subsist beside
 such a Revolution. Your alternative is a slow-pining chronic
 dissolution and new organization; or a swift decisive one; the
 agonies spread over years, or concentrated into an hour. With a
 Mirabeau for Minister or Governor the latter had been the choice;
 with no Mirabeau for Governor it will naturally be the former.
 Chapter 2.2.III.
 Bouillé at Metz. To Bouillé, in his North-Eastern circle, none of these things are
 altogether hid. Many times flight over the marches gleams out on
 him as a last guidance in such bewilderment: nevertheless he
 continues here: struggling always to hope the best, not from new
 organisation but from happy Counter-Revolution and return to the
 old. For the rest it is clear to him that this same National
 Federation, and universal swearing and fraternising of People and
 Soldiers, has done “incalculable mischief.” So much that
 fermented secretly has hereby got vent and become open: National
 Guards and Soldiers of the line, solemnly embracing one another
 on all parade-fields, drinking, swearing patriotic oaths, fall
 into disorderly street-processions, constitutional unmilitary
 exclamations and hurrahings. On which account the Regiment
 Picardie, for one, has to be drawn out in the square of the
 barracks, here at Metz, and sharply harangued by the General
 himself; but expresses penitence.[311] Far and near, as accounts testify, insubordination has begun
 grumbling louder and louder. Officers have been seen shut up in
 their mess-rooms; assaulted with clamorous demands, not without
 menaces. The insubordinate ringleader is dismissed with “yellow
 furlough,” yellow infamous thing they call _cartouche jaune:_ but
 ten new ringleaders rise in his stead, and the yellow _cartouche_
 ceases to be thought disgraceful. “Within a fortnight,” or at
 furthest a month, of that sublime Feast of Pikes, the whole
 French Army, demanding Arrears, forming Reading Clubs,
 frequenting Popular Societies, is in a state which Bouillé can
 call by no name but that of mutiny. Bouillé knows it as few do;
 and speaks by dire experience. Take one instance instead of many. It is still an early day of August, the precise date now
 undiscoverable, when Bouillé, about to set out for the waters of
 Aix la Chapelle, is once more suddenly summoned to the barracks
 of Metz. The soldiers stand ranked in fighting order, muskets
 loaded, the officers all there on compulsion; and require, with
 many-voiced emphasis, to have their arrears paid. Picardie was
 penitent; but we see it has relapsed: the wide space bristles and
 lours with mere mutinous armed men. Brave Bouillé advances to the
 nearest Regiment, opens his commanding lips to harangue; obtains
 nothing but querulous-indignant discordance, and the sound of so
 many thousand livres legally due. The moment is trying; there are
 some ten thousand soldiers now in Metz, and one spirit seems to
 have spread among them. Bouillé is firm as the adamant; but what shall he do? A German
 Regiment, named of Salm, is thought to be of better temper:
 nevertheless Salm too may have heard of the precept, _Thou shalt
 not steal;_ Salm too may know that money is money. Bouillé walks
 trustfully towards the Regiment de Salm, speaks trustful words;
 but here again is answered by the cry of forty-four thousand
 livres odd sous. A cry waxing more and more vociferous, as Salm’s
 humour mounts; which cry, as it will produce no cash or promise
 of cash, ends in the wide simultaneous whirr of shouldered
 muskets, and a determined quick-time march on the part of
 Salm—towards its Colonel’s house, in the next street, there to
 seize the colours and military chest. Thus does Salm, for its
 part; strong in the faith that _meum_ is not _tuum_, that fair
 speeches are not forty-four thousand livres odd sous. Unrestrainable! Salm tramps to military time, quick consuming the
 way. Bouillé and the officers, drawing sword, have to dash into
 double quick _pas-de-charge_, or unmilitary running; to get the
 start; to station themselves on the outer staircase, and stand
 there with what of death-defiance and sharp steel they have; Salm
 truculently coiling itself up, rank after rank, opposite them, in
 such humour as we can fancy, which happily has not yet mounted to
 the murder-pitch. There will Bouillé stand, certain at least of
 _one_ man’s purpose; in grim calmness, awaiting the issue. What
 the intrepidest of men and generals can do is done. Bouillé,
 though there is a barricading picket at each end of the street,
 and death under his eyes, contrives to send for a Dragoon
 Regiment with orders to charge: the dragoon officers mount; the
 dragoon men will not: hope is none there for him. The street, as
 we say, barricaded; the Earth all shut out, only the indifferent
 heavenly Vault overhead: perhaps here or there a timorous
 householder peering out of window, with prayer for Bouillé;
 copious Rascality, on the pavement, with prayer for Salm: there
 do the two parties stand;—like chariots locked in a narrow
 thoroughfare; like locked wrestlers at a dead-grip! For two hours
 they stand; Bouillé’s sword glittering in his hand, adamantine
 resolution clouding his brows: for two hours by the clocks of
 Metz. Moody-silent stands Salm, with occasional clangour; but
 does not fire. Rascality from time to time urges some grenadier
 to level his musket at the General; who looks on it as a bronze
 General would; and always some corporal or other strikes it up. In such remarkable attitude, standing on that staircase for two
 hours, does brave Bouillé, long a shadow, dawn on us visibly out
 of the dimness, and become a person. For the rest, since Salm has
 not shot him at the first instant, and since in himself there is
 no variableness, the danger will diminish. The Mayor, “a man
 infinitely respectable,” with his Municipals and tricolor sashes,
 finally gains entrance; remonstrates, perorates, promises; gets
 Salm persuaded home to its barracks. Next day, our respectable
 Mayor lending the money, the officers pay down the _half_ of the
 demand in ready cash. With which liquidation Salm pacifies
 itself, and for the present all is hushed up, as much as may
 be.[312] Such scenes as this of Metz, or preparations and demonstrations
 towards such, are universal over France: Dampmartin, with his
 knotted forage-cords and piled chamois jackets, is at Strasburg
 in the South-East; in these same days or rather nights, Royal
 Champagne is “shouting _Vive la Nation, au diable les
 Aristocrates_, with some thirty lit candles,” at Hesdin, on the
 far North-West. ‘The garrison of Bitche,’ Deputy Rewbell is sorry
 to state, ‘went out of the town, with drums beating; deposed its
 officers; and then returned into the town, sabre in hand.’[313]
 Ought not a National Assembly to occupy itself with these
 objects? Military France is everywhere full of sour inflammatory
 humour, which exhales itself fuliginously, this way or that: a
 whole continent of smoking flax; which, blown on here or there by
 any angry wind, might so easily start into a blaze, into a
 continent of fire! Constitutional Patriotism is in deep natural alarm at these
 things. The august Assembly sits diligently deliberating; dare
 nowise resolve, with Mirabeau, on an instantaneous disbandment
 and extinction; finds that a course of palliatives is easier. But
 at least and lowest, this grievance of the Arrears shall be
 rectified. A plan, much noised of in those days, under the name
 “Decree of the Sixth of August,” has been devised for that.
 Inspectors shall visit all armies; and, with certain elected
 corporals and “soldiers able to write,” verify what arrears and
 peculations do lie due, and make them good. Well, if in this way
 the smoky heat be cooled down; if it be not, as we say,
 ventilated over-much, or, by sparks and collision somewhere, sent
 _up!_
 Chapter 2.2.IV.
 Arrears at Nanci. We are to remark, however, that of all districts, this of
 Bouillé’s seems the inflammablest. It was always to Bouillé and
 Metz that Royalty would fly: Austria lies near; here more than
 elsewhere must the disunited People look over the borders, into a
 dim sea of Foreign Politics and Diplomacies, with hope or
 apprehension, with mutual exasperation. It was but in these days that certain Austrian troops, marching
 peaceably across an angle of this region, seemed an Invasion
 realised; and there rushed towards Stenai, with musket on
 shoulder, from all the winds, some thirty thousand National
 Guards, to inquire what the matter was.[314] A matter of mere
 diplomacy it proved; the Austrian Kaiser, in haste to get to
 Belgium, had bargained for this short cut. The infinite dim
 movement of European Politics waved a skirt over these spaces,
 passing on its way; like the passing shadow of a condor; and such
 a winged flight of thirty thousand, with mixed cackling and
 crowing, rose in consequence! For, in addition to all, this
 people, as we said, is much divided: Aristocrats abound;
 Patriotism has both Aristocrats and Austrians to watch. It is
 Lorraine, this region; not so illuminated as old France: it
 remembers ancient Feudalisms; nay, within man’s memory, it had a
 Court and King of its own, or indeed the splendour of a Court and
 King, without the burden. Then, contrariwise, the Mother Society,
 which sits in the Jacobins Church at Paris, has Daughters in the
 Towns here; shrill-tongued, driven acrid: consider how the memory
 of good King Stanislaus, and ages of Imperial Feudalism, may
 comport with this New acrid Evangel, and what a virulence of
 discord there may be! In all which, the Soldiery, officers on one
 side, private men on the other, takes part, and now indeed
 principal part; a Soldiery, moreover, all the hotter here as it
 lies the denser, the frontier Province requiring more of it. So stands Lorraine: but the capital City, more especially so. The
 pleasant City of Nanci, which faded Feudalism loves, where King
 Stanislaus personally dwelt and shone, has an Aristocrat
 Municipality, and then also a Daughter Society: it has some forty
 thousand divided souls of population; and three large Regiments,
 one of which is Swiss Château-Vieux, dear to Patriotism ever
 since it refused fighting, or was thought to refuse, in the
 Bastille days. Here unhappily all evil influences seem to meet
 concentered; here, of all places, may jealousy and heat evolve
 itself. These many months, accordingly, man has been set against
 man, Washed against Unwashed; Patriot Soldier against Aristocrat
 Captain, ever the more bitterly; and a long score of grudges has
 been running up. Nameable grudges, and likewise unnameable: for there is a
 punctual nature in Wrath; and daily, were there but glances of
 the eye, tones of the voice, and minutest commissions or
 omissions, it will jot down somewhat, to account, under the head
 of sundries, which always swells the sum-total. For example, in
 April last, in those times of preliminary Federation, when
 National Guards and Soldiers were every where swearing
 brotherhood, and all France was locally federating, preparing for
 the grand National Feast of Pikes, it was observed that these
 Nanci Officers threw cold water on the whole brotherly business;
 that they first hung back from appearing at the Nanci Federation;
 then did appear, but in mere _rédingote_ and undress, with
 scarcely a clean shirt on; nay that one of them, as the National
 Colours flaunted by in that solemn moment, did, without visible
 necessity, take occasion to _spit_.[315] Small “sundries as per journal,” but then incessant ones! The
 Aristocrat Municipality, pretending to be Constitutional, keeps
 mostly quiet; not so the Daughter Society, the five thousand
 adult male Patriots of the place, still less the five thousand
 female: not so the young, whiskered or whiskerless,
 four-generation Noblesse in epaulettes; the grim Patriot Swiss of
 Château-Vieux, effervescent infantry of Regiment du Roi, hot
 troopers of Mestre-de-Camp! Walled Nanci, which stands so bright
 and trim, with its straight streets, spacious squares, and
 Stanislaus’ Architecture, on the fruitful alluvium of the
 Meurthe; so bright, amid the yellow cornfields in these
 Reaper-Months,—is inwardly but a den of discord, anxiety,
 inflammability, not far from exploding. Let Bouillé look to it.
 If that universal military heat, which we liken to a vast
 continent of smoking flax, do any where take fire, his beard,
 here in Lorraine and Nanci, may the most readily of all get
 singed by it. Bouillé, for his part, is busy enough, but only with the general
 superintendence; getting his pacified Salm, and all other still
 tolerable Regiments, marched out of Metz, to southward towns and
 villages; to rural Cantonments as at Vic, Marsal and thereabout,
 by the still waters; where is plenty of horse-forage, sequestered
 parade-ground, and the soldier’s speculative faculty can be
 stilled by drilling. Salm, as we said, received only half payment
 of arrears; naturally not without grumbling. Nevertheless that
 scene of the drawn sword may, after all, have raised Bouillé in
 the mind of Salm; for men and soldiers love intrepidity and swift
 inflexible decision, even when they suffer by it. As indeed is
 not this fundamentally the quality of qualities for a man? A
 quality which by itself is next to nothing, since inferior
 animals, asses, dogs, even mules have it; yet, in due
 combination, it is the indispensable basis of all. Of Nanci and its heats, Bouillé, commander of the whole, knows
 nothing special; understands generally that the troops in that
 City are perhaps the _worst_.[316] The Officers there have it
 all, as they have long had it, to themselves; and unhappily seem
 to manage it ill. “Fifty yellow furloughs,” given out in one
 batch, do surely betoken difficulties. But what was Patriotism to
 think of certain light-fencing Fusileers “set on,” or supposed to
 be set on, “to insult the Grenadier-club,” considerate
 speculative Grenadiers, and that reading-room of theirs? With
 shoutings, with hootings; till the speculative Grenadier drew his
 side-arms too; and there ensued battery and duels! Nay more, are
 not swashbucklers of the same stamp “sent out” visibly, or sent
 out presumably, now in the dress of Soldiers to pick quarrels
 with the Citizens; now, disguised as Citizens, to pick quarrels
 with the Soldiers? For a certain Roussière, expert in fence, was
 taken in the very fact; four Officers (presumably of tender
 years) hounding him on, who thereupon fled precipitately!
 Fence-master Roussière, haled to the guardhouse, had sentence of
 three months’ imprisonment: but his comrades demanded “yellow
 furlough” for _him_ of all persons; nay, thereafter they produced
 him on parade; capped him in paper-helmet inscribed, _Iscariot;_
 marched him to the gate of City; and there sternly commanded him
 to vanish for evermore. On all which suspicions, accusations and noisy procedure, and on
 enough of the like continually accumulating, the Officer could
 not but look with disdainful indignation; perhaps disdainfully
 express the same in words, and “soon after fly over to the
 Austrians.” So that when it here as elsewhere comes to the question of
 Arrears, the humour and procedure is of the bitterest: Regiment
 Mestre-de-Camp getting, amid loud clamour, some three gold louis
 a-man,—which have, as usual, to be borrowed from the
 Municipality; Swiss Château-Vieux applying for the like, but
 getting instead instantaneous _courrois_, or cat-o’-nine-tails,
 with subsequent unsufferable hisses from the women and children;
 Regiment du Roi, sick of hope deferred, at length seizing its
 military chest, and marching it to quarters, but next day
 marching it back again, through streets all struck
 silent:—unordered paradings and clamours, not without strong
 liquor; objurgation, insubordination; your military ranked
 Arrangement going all (as the Typographers say of set types, in a
 similar case) rapidly _to pie!_[317] Such is Nanci in these early
 days of August; the sublime Feast of Pikes not yet a month old. Constitutional Patriotism, at Paris and elsewhere, may well quake
 at the news. War-Minister Latour du Pin runs breathless to the
 National Assembly, with a written message that “all is burning,
 _tout brûle, tout presse_.” The National Assembly, on spur of the
 instant, renders such _Decret_, and “order to submit and repent,”
 as he requires; if it will avail any thing. On the other hand,
 Journalism, through all its throats, gives hoarse outcry,
 condemnatory, elegiac-applausive. The Forty-eight Sections, lift
 up voices; sonorous Brewer, or call him now _Colonel_ Santerre,
 is not silent, in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. For, meanwhile, the
 Nanci Soldiers have sent a Deputation of Ten, furnished with
 documents and proofs; who will tell another story than the
 “all-is-burning” one. Which deputed Ten, before ever they reach
 the Assembly Hall, assiduous Latour du Pin picks up, and on
 warrant of Mayor Bailly, claps in prison! Most
 unconstitutionally; for they had officers’ furloughs. Whereupon
 Saint-Antoine, in indignant uncertainty of the future, closes its
 shops. Is Bouillé a traitor then, sold to Austria? In that case,
 these poor private sentinels have revolted mainly out of
 Patriotism? New Deputation, Deputation of National Guardsmen now, sets forth
 from Nanci to enlighten the Assembly. It meets the old deputed
 Ten returning, quite unexpectedly _un_hanged; and proceeds
 thereupon with better prospects; but effects nothing.
 Deputations, Government Messengers, Orderlies at hand-gallops,
 Alarms, thousand-voiced Rumours, go vibrating continually;
 backwards and forwards,—scattering distraction. Not till the last
 week of August does M. de Malseigne, selected as Inspector, get
 down to the scene of mutiny; with Authority, with cash, and
 “Decree of the Sixth of August.” He now shall see these Arrears
 liquidated, justice done, or at least tumult quashed.
 Chapter 2.2.V.
 Inspector Malseigne. Of Inspector Malseigne we discern, by direct light, that he is
 “of Herculean stature;” and infer, with probability, that he is
 of truculent moustachioed aspect,—for _Royalist_ Officers now
 leave the upper lip unshaven; that he is of indomitable
 bull-heart; and also, unfortunately, of thick bull-head. On Tuesday the 24th of August, 1790, he opens session as
 Inspecting Commissioner; meets those “elected corporals, and
 soldiers that can write.” He finds the accounts of Château-Vieux
 to be complex; to require delay and reference: he takes to
 haranguing, to reprimanding; ends amid audible grumbling. Next
 morning, he resumes session, not at the Townhall as prudent
 Municipals counselled, but once more at the barracks.
 Unfortunately Château-Vieux, grumbling all night, will now hear
 of no delay or reference; from reprimanding on his part, it goes
 to bullying,—answered with continual cries of ‘_Jugez tout de
 suite_, Judge it at once;’ whereupon M. de Malseigne will off in
 a huff. But lo, Château Vieux, swarming all about the
 barrack-court, has sentries at every gate; M. de Malseigne,
 demanding egress, cannot get it, though Commandant Denoue backs
 him; can get only ‘_Jugez tout de suite_.’ Here is a nodus!');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Bull-hearted M. de Malseigne draws his sword; and will force
 egress. Confused splutter. M. de Malseigne’s sword breaks; he
 snatches Commandant Denoue’s: the sentry is wounded. M. de
 Malseigne, whom one is loath to kill, does force egress,—followed
 by Château-Vieux all in disarray; a spectacle to Nanci. M. de
 Malseigne walks at a sharp pace, yet never runs; wheeling from
 time to time, with menaces and movements of fence; and so reaches
 Denoue’s house, unhurt; which house Château-Vieux, in an agitated
 manner, invests,—hindered as yet from entering, by a crowd of
 officers formed on the staircase. M. de Malseigne retreats by
 back ways to the Townhall, flustered though undaunted; amid an
 escort of National Guards. From the Townhall he, on the morrow,
 emits fresh orders, fresh plans of settlement with Château-Vieux;
 to none of which will Château-Vieux listen: whereupon finally he,
 amid noise enough, emits order that Château-Vieux shall march on
 the morrow morning, and quarter at Sarre Louis. Château-Vieux
 flatly refuses marching; M. de Malseigne “takes _act_,” due
 notarial protest, of such refusal,—if happily that may avail him. This is end of Thursday; and, indeed, of M. de Malseigne’s
 Inspectorship, which has lasted some fifty hours. To such length,
 in fifty hours, has he unfortunately brought it. Mestre-de-Camp
 and Regiment du Roi hang, as it were, fluttering: Château-Vieux
 is clean gone, in what way we see. Over night, an Aide-de-Camp of
 Lafayette’s, stationed here for such emergency, sends swift
 emissaries far and wide, to summon National Guards. The slumber
 of the country is broken by clattering hoofs, by loud fraternal
 knockings; every where the Constitutional Patriot must clutch his
 fighting-gear, and take the road for Nanci. And thus the Herculean Inspector has sat all Thursday, among
 terror-struck Municipals, a centre of confused noise: all
 Thursday, Friday, and till Saturday towards noon. Château-Vieux,
 in spite of the notarial protest, will not march a step. As many
 as four thousand National Guards are dropping or pouring in;
 uncertain what is expected of them, still more uncertain what
 will be obtained of them. For all is uncertainty, commotion, and
 suspicion: there goes a word that Bouillé, beginning to bestir
 himself in the rural Cantonments eastward, is but a Royalist
 traitor; that Château-Vieux and Patriotism are sold to Austria,
 of which latter M. de Malseigne is probably some agent.
 Mestre-de-Camp and Roi flutter still more questionably:
 Château-Vieux, far from marching, “waves red flags out of two
 carriages,” in a passionate manner, along the streets; and next
 morning answers its Officers: ‘Pay us, then; and we will march
 with you to the world’s end!’ Under which circumstances, towards noon on Saturday, M. de
 Malseigne thinks it were good perhaps to inspect the ramparts,—on
 horseback. He mounts, accordingly, with escort of three troopers.
 At the gate of the city, he bids two of them wait for his return;
 and with the third, a trooper to be depended upon, he—gallops off
 for Lunéville; where lies a certain Carabineer Regiment not yet
 in a mutinous state! The two left troopers soon get uneasy;
 discover how it is, and give the alarm. Mestre-de-Camp, to the
 number of a hundred, saddles in frantic haste, as if sold to
 Austria; gallops out pellmell in chase of its Inspector. And so
 they spur, and the Inspector spurs; careering, with noise and
 jingle, up the valley of the River Meurthe, towards Lunéville and
 the midday sun: through an astonished country; indeed almost
 their own astonishment. What a hunt, Actæon-like;—which Actæon de Malseigne happily
 _gains._ To arms, ye Carabineers of Lunéville: to chastise
 mutinous men, insulting your General Officer, insulting your own
 quarters;—above all things, fire _soon_, lest there be parleying
 and ye refuse to fire! The Carabineers fire soon, exploding upon
 the first stragglers of Mestre-de-Camp; who shrink at the very
 flash, and fall back hastily on Nanci, in a state not far from
 distraction. Panic and fury: sold to Austria without an _if;_ so
 much per regiment, the very sums can be specified; and traitorous
 Malseigne is fled! Help, O Heaven; help, thou Earth,—ye unwashed
 Patriots; ye too are sold like us! Effervescent Regiment du Roi primes its firelocks, Mestre-de-Camp
 saddles wholly: Commandant Denoue is seized, is flung in prison
 with a “canvass shirt” (_sarreau de toile_) about him;
 Château-Vieux bursts up the magazines; distributes “three
 thousand fusils” to a Patriot people: Austria shall have a hot
 bargain. Alas, the unhappy hunting-dogs, as we said, have _hunted
 away_ their huntsman; and do now run howling and baying, on what
 trail they know not; nigh rabid! And so there is tumultuous march of men, through the night; with
 halt on the heights of Flinval, whence Lunéville can be seen all
 illuminated. Then there is parley, at four in the morning; and
 reparley; finally there is agreement: the Carabineers give in;
 Malseigne is surrendered, with apologies on all sides. After
 weary confused hours, he is even got under way; the Lunévillers
 all turning out, in the idle Sunday, to see such departure:
 home-going of mutinous Mestre-de-Camp with its Inspector captive.
 Mestre-de-Camp accordingly marches; the Lunévillers look. See! at
 the corner of the first street, our Inspector bounds off again,
 bull-hearted as he is; amid the slash of sabres, the crackle of
 musketry; and escapes, full gallop, with only a ball lodged in
 his buff-_jerkin_. The Herculean man! And yet it is an escape to
 no purpose. For the Carabineers, to whom after the hardest
 Sunday’s ride on record, he has come circling back, “stand
 deliberating by their nocturnal watch-fires;” deliberating of
 Austria, of traitors, and the rage of Mestre-de-Camp. So that, on
 the whole, the next sight we have is that of M. de Malseigne, on
 the Monday afternoon, faring bull-hearted through the streets of
 Nanci; in open carriage, a soldier standing over him with drawn
 sword; amid the “furies of the women,” hedges of National Guards,
 and confusion of Babel: to the Prison beside Commandant Denoue!
 That finally is the lodging of Inspector Malseigne.[318] Surely it is time Bouillé were drawing near. The Country all
 round, alarmed with watchfires, illuminated towns, and marching
 and rout, has been sleepless these several nights. Nanci, with
 its uncertain National Guards, with its distributed fusils,
 mutinous soldiers, black panic and redhot ire, is not a City but
 a Bedlam.
 Chapter 2.2.VI.
 Bouillé at Nanci. Haste with help, thou brave Bouillé: if swift help come not, all
 is now verily “burning;” and may burn,—to what lengths and
 breadths! Much, in these hours, depends on Bouillé; as it shall
 now fare with him, the whole Future may be this way or be that.
 If, for example, he were to loiter dubitating, and not come: if
 he were to come, and fail: the whole Soldiery of France to blaze
 into mutiny, National Guards going some this way, some that; and
 Royalism to draw its rapier, and Sansculottism to snatch its
 pike; and the Spirit if Jacobinism, as yet young, girt with
 sun-rays, to grow instantaneously mature, girt with hell-fire,—as
 mortals, in one night of deadly crisis, have had their heads
 turned gray! Brave Bouillé is advancing fast, with the old inflexibility;
 gathering himself, unhappily “in small affluences,” from East,
 from West and North; and now on Tuesday morning, the last day of
 the month, he stands all concentred, unhappily still in small
 force, at the village of Frouarde, within some few miles. Son of
 Adam with a more dubious task before him is not in the world this
 Tuesday morning. A weltering inflammable sea of doubt and peril,
 and Bouillé sure of simply one thing, his own determination.
 Which one thing, indeed, may be worth many. He puts a most firm
 face on the matter: “Submission, or unsparing battle and
 destruction; twenty-four hours to make your choice:” this was the
 tenor of his Proclamation; thirty copies of which he sent
 yesterday to Nanci:—all which, we find, were intercepted and not
 posted.[319] Nevertheless, at half-past eleven, this morning, seemingly by way
 of answer, there does wait on him at Frouarde, some Deputation
 from the mutinous Regiments, from the Nanci Municipals, to see
 what can be done. Bouillé receives this Deputation, “in a large
 open court adjoining his lodging:” pacified Salm, and the rest,
 attend also, being invited to do it,—all happily still in the
 right humour. The Mutineers pronounce themselves with a
 decisiveness, which to Bouillé seems insolence; and happily to
 Salm also. Salm, forgetful of the Metz staircase and sabre,
 demands that the scoundrels “be hanged” there and then. Bouillé
 represses the hanging; but answers that mutinous Soldiers have
 one course, and not more than one: To liberate, with heartfelt
 contrition, Messieurs Denoue and de Malseigne; to get ready
 forthwith for marching off, whither he shall order; and “submit
 and repent,” as the National Assembly has decreed, as he
 yesterday did in thirty printed Placards proclaim. These are his
 terms, unalterable as the decrees of Destiny. Which terms as
 they, the Mutineer deputies, seemingly do not accept, it were
 good for them to vanish from this spot, and even promptly; with
 him too, in few instants, the word will be, Forward! The Mutineer
 deputies vanish, not unpromptly; the Municipal ones, anxious
 beyond right for their own individualities, prefer abiding with
 Bouillé. Brave Bouillé, though he puts a most firm face on the matter,
 knows his position full well: how at Nanci, what with rebellious
 soldiers, with uncertain National Guards, and so many distributed
 fusils, there rage and roar some ten thousand fighting men; while
 with himself is scarcely the third part of that number, in
 National Guards also uncertain, in mere pacified Regiments,—for
 the present full of rage, and clamour to march; but whose rage
 and clamour may next moment take such a fatal new figure. On the
 top of one uncertain billow, therewith to calm billows! Bouillé
 must “abandon himself to Fortune;” who is said sometimes to
 favour the brave. At half-past twelve, the Mutineer deputies
 having vanished, our drums beat; we march: for Nanci! Let Nanci
 bethink itself, then; for Bouillé has thought and determined. And yet how shall Nanci think: not a City but a Bedlam! Grim
 Château-Vieux is for defence to the death; forces the
 Municipality to order, by tap of drum, all citizens acquainted
 with artillery to turn out, and assist in managing the cannon. On
 the other hand, effervescent Regiment du Roi, is drawn up in its
 barracks; quite disconsolate, hearing the humour Salm is in; and
 ejaculates dolefully from its thousand throats: ‘_La loi, la
 loi_, Law, law!’ Mestre-de-Camp blusters, with profane swearing,
 in mixed terror and furor; National Guards look this way and
 that, not knowing what to do. What a Bedlam-City: as many plans
 as heads; all ordering, none obeying: quiet none,—except the
 Dead, who sleep underground, having _done_ their fighting! And, behold, Bouillé proves as good as his word: “at half-past
 two” scouts report that he is within half a league of the gates;
 rattling along, with cannon, and array; breathing nothing but
 destruction. A new Deputation, Municipals, Mutineers, Officers,
 goes out to meet him; with passionate entreaty for yet one other
 hour. Bouillé grants an hour. Then, at the end thereof, no Denoue
 or Malseigne appearing as promised, he rolls his drums, and again
 takes the road. Towards four o’clock, the terror-struck Townsmen
 may see him face to face. His cannons rattle there, in their
 carriages; his vanguard is within thirty paces of the Gate
 Stanislaus. Onward like a Planet, by appointed times, by law of
 Nature! What next? Lo, flag of truce and chamade; conjuration to
 halt: Malseigne and Denoue are on the street, coming hither; the
 soldiers all repentant, ready to submit and march! Adamantine
 Bouillé’s look alters not; yet the word _Halt_ is given: gladder
 moment he never saw. Joy of joys! Malseigne and Denoue do verily
 issue; escorted by National Guards; from streets all frantic,
 with sale to Austria and so forth: they salute Bouillé,
 unscathed. Bouillé steps aside to speak with them, and with other
 heads of the Town there; having already ordered by what Gates and
 Routes the mutineer Regiments shall file out. Such colloquy with these two General Officers and other principal
 Townsmen, was natural enough; nevertheless one wishes Bouillé had
 postponed it, and _not_ stepped aside. Such tumultuous
 inflammable masses, tumbling along, making way for each other;
 this of keen nitrous oxide, that of sulphurous fire-damp,—were it
 not well to stand _between_ them, keeping them well separate,
 till the space be cleared? Numerous stragglers of Château-Vieux
 and the rest have not marched with their main columns, which are
 filing out by the appointed Gates, taking station in the open
 meadows. National Guards are in a state of nearly distracted
 uncertainty; the populace, armed and unharmed, roll openly
 delirious,—betrayed, sold to the Austrians, sold to the
 Aristocrats. There are loaded cannon with lit matches among them,
 and Bouillé’s vanguard is halted within thirty paces of the Gate.
 Command dwells not in that mad inflammable mass; which smoulders
 and tumbles there, in blind smoky rage; which will not open the
 Gate when summoned; says it will open the cannon’s throat
 sooner!—Cannonade not, O Friends, or be it through my body! cries
 heroic young Desilles, young Captain of _Roi_, clasping the
 murderous engine in his arms, and holding it. Château-Vieux
 Swiss, by main force, with oaths and menaces, wrench off the
 heroic youth; who undaunted, amid still louder oaths seats
 himself on the touch-hole. Amid still louder oaths; with ever
 louder clangour,—and, alas, with the loud crackle of first one,
 and then three other muskets; which explode into his body; which
 roll _it_ in the dust,—and do also, in the loud madness of such
 moment, bring lit cannon-match to ready priming; and so, with one
 thunderous belch of grapeshot, blast some fifty of Bouillé’s
 vanguard into air! Fatal! That sputter of the first musket-shot has kindled such a
 cannon-shot, such a death-blaze; and all is now redhot madness,
 conflagration as of Tophet. With demoniac rage, the Bouillé
 vanguard storms through that Gate Stanislaus; with fiery sweep,
 sweeps Mutiny clear away, to death, or into shelters and cellars;
 from which latter, again, Mutiny continues firing. The ranked
 Regiments hear it in their meadow; they rush back again through
 the nearest Gates; Bouillé gallops in, distracted, inaudible;—and
 now has begun, in Nanci, as in that doomed Hall of the
 Nibelungen, “a murder grim and great.” Miserable: such scene of dismal aimless madness as the anger of
 Heaven but rarely permits among men! From cellar or from garret,
 from open street in front, from successive corners of
 cross-streets on each hand, Château-Vieux and Patriotism keep up
 the murderous rolling-fire, on murderous not Unpatriotic fires.
 Your blue National Captain, riddled with balls, one hardly knows
 on whose side fighting, requests to be laid on the colours to
 die: the patriotic Woman (name not given, deed surviving) screams
 to Château-Vieux that it must _not_ fire the other cannon; and
 even flings a pail of water on it, since screaming avails
 not.[320] Thou shalt fight; thou shalt not fight; and with whom
 shalt thou fight! Could tumult awaken the old Dead, Burgundian
 Charles the Bold might stir from under that Rotunda of his: never
 since he, raging, sank in the ditches, and lost Life and Diamond,
 was such a noise heard here. Three thousand, as some count, lie mangled, gory; the half of
 Château-Vieux has been shot, without need of Court Martial.
 Cavalry, of Mestre-de-Camp or their foes, can do little. Regiment
 du Roi was persuaded to its barracks; stands there palpitating.
 Bouillé, armed with the terrors of the Law, and favoured of
 Fortune, finally triumphs. In two murderous hours he has
 penetrated to the grand Squares, dauntless, though with loss of
 forty officers and five hundred men: the shattered remnants of
 Château-Vieux are seeking covert. Regiment du Roi, not
 effervescent now, alas no, but _having_ effervesced, will offer
 to ground its arms; will “march in a quarter of an hour.” Nay
 these poor effervesced require “escort” to march with, and get
 it; though they are thousands strong, and have thirty
 ball-cartridges a man! The Sun is not yet down, when Peace, which
 might have come bloodless, has come bloody: the mutinous
 Regiments are on march, doleful, on their three Routes; and from
 Nanci rises wail of women and men, the voice of weeping and
 desolation; the City weeping for its slain who awaken not. These
 streets are empty but for victorious patrols. Thus has Fortune, favouring the brave, dragged Bouillé, as
 himself says, out of such a frightful peril, “by the hair of the
 head.” An intrepid adamantine man this Bouillé:—had _he_ stood in
 old Broglie’s place, in those Bastille days, it might have been
 all different! He has extinguished mutiny, and immeasurable civil
 war. Not for nothing, as we see; yet at a rate which he and
 Constitutional Patriotism considers cheap. Nay, as for Bouillé,
 he, urged by subsequent contradiction which arose, declares
 coldly, it was rather against his own private mind, and more by
 public military rule of duty, that he did extinguish
 it,[321]—immeasurable civil war being now the only chance. Urged,
 we say, by subsequent contradiction! Civil war, indeed, is Chaos;
 and in all vital Chaos, there is new Order shaping itself free:
 but what a faith this, that of all new Orders out of Chaos and
 Possibility of Man and his Universe, Louis Sixteenth and
 Two-Chamber Monarchy were precisely the one that would shape
 itself! It is like undertaking to throw deuce-ace, say only five
 hundred successive times, and any other throw to be fatal—for
 Bouillé. Rather thank Fortune, and Heaven, always, thou intrepid
 Bouillé; and let contradiction of its way! Civil war,
 conflagrating universally over France at this moment, might have
 led to one thing or to another thing: meanwhile, to _quench_
 conflagration, wheresoever one finds it, wheresoever one can;
 this, in all times, is the rule for man and General Officer. But at Paris, so agitated and divided, fancy how it went, when
 the continually vibrating Orderlies vibrated _thither_ at hand
 gallop, with such questionable news! High is the gratulation; and
 also deep the indignation. An august Assembly, by overwhelming
 majorities, passionately thanks Bouillé; a King’s autograph, the
 voices of all Loyal, all Constitutional men run to the same
 tenor. A solemn National funeral-service, for the Law-defenders
 slain at Nanci; is said and sung in the Champ de Mars; Bailly,
 Lafayette and National Guards, all except the few that protested,
 assist. With pomp and circumstance, with episcopal Calicoes in
 tricolor girdles, Altar of Fatherland smoking with cassolettes,
 or incense-kettles; the vast Champ-de-Mars wholly hung round with
 black mortcloth,—which mortcloth and expenditure Marat thinks had
 better have been laid out in bread, in these dear days, and given
 to the hungry living Patriot.[322] On the other hand, living
 Patriotism, and Saint-Antoine, which we have seen noisily closing
 its shops and such like, assembles now “to the number of forty
 thousand;” and, with loud cries, under the very windows of the
 thanking National Assembly, demands revenge for murdered
 Brothers, judgment on Bouillé, and instant dismissal of
 War-Minister Latour du Pin. At sound and sight of which things, if not War-Minister Latour,
 yet “Adored Minister” Necker, sees good on the 3d of September
 1790, to withdraw softly almost privily,—with an eye to the
 “recovery of his health.” Home to native Switzerland; not as he
 last came; lucky to reach it alive! Fifteen months ago, we saw
 him coming, with escort of horse, with sound of clarion and
 trumpet: and now at Arcis-sur-Aube, while he departs unescorted
 soundless, the Populace and Municipals stop him as a fugitive,
 are not unlike massacring him as a traitor; the National
 Assembly, consulted on the matter, gives him free egress as a
 nullity. Such an unstable “drift-mould of Accident” is the
 substance of this lower world, for them that dwell in houses of
 clay; so, especially in hot regions and times, do the proudest
 palaces we build of it take wings, and become Sahara
 sand-palaces, spinning many pillared in the whirlwind, and bury
 us under their sand!— In spite of the forty thousand, the National Assembly persists in
 its thanks; and Royalist Latour du Pin continues Minister. The
 forty thousand assemble next day, as loud as ever; roll towards
 Latour’s Hôtel; find cannon on the porch-steps with flambeau lit;
 and have to retire elsewhither, and digest their spleen, or
 re-absorb it into the blood. Over in Lorraine, meanwhile, they of the distributed fusils,
 ringleaders of Mestre-de-Camp, of Roi, have got marked out for
 judgment;—yet shall never get judged. Briefer is the doom of
 Château-Vieux. Château-Vieux is, by Swiss law, given up for
 instant trial in Court-Martial of its own officers. Which
 Court-Martial, with all brevity (in not many hours), has hanged
 some Twenty-three, on conspicuous gibbets; marched some
 Three-score in chains to the Galleys; and so, to appearance,
 finished the matter off. Hanged men do cease for ever from this
 Earth; but out of chains and the Galleys there may be
 resuscitation in triumph. Resuscitation for the chained Hero; and
 even for the chained Scoundrel, or Semi-scoundrel! Scottish John
 Knox, such World-Hero, as we know, sat once nevertheless pulling
 grim-taciturn at the oar of French Galley, “in the _Water of
 Lore;_” and even flung their Virgin-Mary over, instead of kissing
 her,—as “a _pented bredd_,” or timber Virgin, who could naturally
 swim.[323] So, ye of Château-Vieux, tug patiently, not without
 hope! But indeed at Nanci generally, Aristocracy rides triumphant,
 rough. Bouillé is gone again, the second day; an Aristocrat
 Municipality, with free course, is as cruel as it had before been
 cowardly. The Daughter Society, as the mother of the whole
 mischief, lies ignominiously suppressed; the Prisons can hold no
 more; bereaved down-beaten Patriotism murmurs, not loud but deep.
 Here and in the neighbouring Towns, “flattened balls” picked from
 the streets of Nanci are worn at buttonholes: balls flattened in
 carrying death to Patriotism; men wear them there, in perpetual
 memento of revenge. Mutineer Deserters roam the woods; have to
 demand charity at the musket’s end. All is dissolution, mutual
 rancour, gloom and despair:—till National-Assembly Commissioners
 arrive, with a steady gentle flame of Constitutionalism in their
 hearts; who gently lift up the down-trodden, gently pull down the
 too uplifted; reinstate the Daughter Society, recall the Mutineer
 Deserter; gradually levelling, strive in all wise ways to smooth
 and soothe. With such gradual mild levelling on the one side; as
 with solemn funeral-service, Cassolettes, Courts-Martial,
 National thanks,—all that Officiality can do is done. The
 buttonhole will drop its flat ball; the black ashes, so far as
 may be, get green again. This is the “Affair of Nanci;” by some called the “Massacre of
 Nanci;”—properly speaking, the unsightly _wrong_-side of that
 thrice glorious Feast of Pikes, the right-side of which formed a
 spectacle for the very gods. Right-side and wrong lie always so
 near: the one was in July, in August the other! Theatres, the
 theatres over in London, are bright with their pasteboard
 simulacrum of that “Federation of the French People,” brought out
 as Drama: this of Nanci, we may say, though not played in any
 pasteboard Theatre, did for many months enact itself, and even
 walk spectrally—in all French heads. For the news of it fly
 pealing through all France; awakening, in town and village, in
 clubroom, messroom, to the utmost borders, some mimic reflex or
 imaginative repetition of the business; always with the angry
 questionable assertion: It was right; It was wrong. Whereby come
 controversies, duels, embitterment, vain jargon; the hastening
 forward, the augmenting and intensifying of whatever new
 explosions lie in store for us. Meanwhile, at this cost or at that, the mutiny, as we say, is
 stilled. The French Army has neither burst up in universal
 simultaneous delirium; nor been at once disbanded, put an end to,
 and made new again. It must die in the chronic manner, through
 years, by inches; with partial revolts, as of Brest Sailors or
 the like, which dare not spread; with men unhappy, insubordinate;
 officers unhappier, in Royalist moustachioes, taking horse,
 singly or in bodies, across the Rhine:[324] sick dissatisfaction,
 sick disgust on both sides; the Army moribund, fit for no
 duty:—till it do, in that unexpected manner, Phoenix-like, with
 long throes, get both dead and newborn; then start forth strong,
 nay stronger and even strongest. Thus much was the brave Bouillé hitherto fated to do. Wherewith
 let him again fade into dimness; and at Metz or the rural
 Cantonments, assiduously drilling, mysteriously diplomatising, in
 scheme within scheme, hover as formerly a faint shadow, the hope
 of Royalty.
 BOOK 2.III.
 THE TUILERIES
 Chapter 2.3.I.
 Epimenides. How true that there is nothing dead in this Universe; that what
 we call dead is only changed, its forces working in inverse
 order! “The leaf that lies rotting in moist winds,” says one,
 “has still force; else how could it _rot?_” Our whole Universe is
 but an infinite Complex of Forces; thousandfold, from Gravitation
 up to Thought and Will; man’s Freedom environed with Necessity of
 Nature: in all which nothing at any moment slumbers, but all is
 for ever awake and busy. The thing that lies isolated inactive
 thou shalt nowhere discover; seek every where from the granite
 mountain, slow-mouldering since Creation, to the passing
 cloud-vapour, to the living man; to the action, to the spoken
 word of man. The word that is spoken, as we know,
 flies-irrevocable: not less, but more, the action that is done.
 “The gods themselves,” sings Pindar, “cannot annihilate the
 action that is done.” No: this, once done, is done always; cast
 forth into endless Time; and, long conspicuous or soon hidden,
 must verily work and grow for ever there, an indestructible new
 element in the Infinite of Things. Or, indeed, what _is_ this
 Infinite of Things itself, which men name Universe, but an
 action, a sum-total of Actions and Activities? The living
 ready-made sum-total of these three,—which Calculation cannot
 add, cannot bring on its tablets; yet the sum, we say, is written
 visible: All that has been done, All that is doing, All that will
 be done! Understand it well, the Thing thou beholdest, that Thing
 is an Action, the product and expression of exerted Force: the
 All of Things is an infinite conjugation of the verb _To do._
 Shoreless Fountain-Ocean of Force, of power to _do;_ wherein
 Force rolls and circles, billowing, many-streamed, harmonious;
 wide as Immensity, deep as Eternity; beautiful and terrible, not
 to be comprehended: this is what man names Existence and
 Universe; this thousand-tinted Flame-image, at once veil and
 revelation, reflex such as he, in his poor brain and heart, can
 paint, of One Unnameable dwelling in inaccessible light! From
 beyond the Star-galaxies, from before the Beginning of Days, it
 billows and rolls,—round _thee_, nay thyself art of it, in this
 point of Space where thou now standest, in this moment which thy
 clock measures. Or apart from all Transcendentalism, is it not a plain truth of
 sense, which the duller mind can even consider as a truism, that
 human things wholly are in continual movement, and action and
 reaction; working continually forward, phasis after phasis, by
 unalterable laws, towards prescribed issues? How often must we
 say, and yet not rightly lay to heart: The seed that is sown, it
 will spring! Given the summer’s blossoming, then there is also
 given the autumnal withering: so is it ordered not with
 seedfields only, but with transactions, arrangements,
 philosophies, societies, French Revolutions, whatsoever man works
 with in this lower world. The Beginning holds in it the End, and
 all that leads thereto; as the acorn does the oak and its
 fortunes. Solemn enough, did we think of it,—which unhappily and
 also happily we do not very much! Thou there canst begin; the
 Beginning is for thee, and there: but where, and of what sort,
 and for whom will the End be? All grows, and seeks and endures
 its destinies: consider likewise how much grows, as the trees do,
 whether _we_ think of it or not. So that when your Epimenides,
 your somnolent Peter Klaus, since named Rip van Winkle, awakens
 again, he finds it a changed world. In that seven-years’ sleep of
 his, so much has changed! All that is without us will change
 while we think not of it; much even that is within us. The truth
 that was yesterday a restless Problem, has today grown a Belief
 burning to be uttered: on the morrow, contradiction has
 exasperated it into mad Fanaticism; obstruction has dulled it
 into sick Inertness; it is sinking towards silence, of
 satisfaction or of resignation. Today is not Yesterday, for man
 or for thing. Yesterday there was the oath of Love; today has
 come the curse of Hate. Not willingly: ah, no; but it could not
 help coming. The golden radiance of youth, would it willingly
 have tarnished itself into the dimness of old age?—Fearful: how
 we stand enveloped, deep-sunk, in that Mystery of TIME; and are
 Sons of Time; fashioned and woven out of Time; and on us, and on
 all that we have, or see, or do, is written: Rest not, Continue
 not, Forward to thy doom!');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' But in seasons of Revolution, which indeed distinguish themselves
 from common seasons by their _velocity_ mainly, your miraculous
 Seven-sleeper might, with miracle enough, wake _sooner:_ not by
 the century, or seven years, need he sleep; often not by the
 seven months. Fancy, for example, some new Peter Klaus, sated
 with the jubilee of that Federation day, had lain down, say
 directly after the Blessing of Talleyrand; and, reckoning it all
 safe _now_, had fallen composedly asleep under the timber-work of
 the Fatherland’s Altar; to sleep there, not twenty-one years, but
 as it were year and day. The cannonading of Nanci, so far off,
 does not disturb him; nor does the black mortcloth, close at
 hand, nor the requiems chanted, and minute guns, incense-pans and
 concourse right over his head: none of these; but Peter sleeps
 through them all. Through one circling year, as we say; from July
 14th of 1790, till July the 17th of 1791: but on that latter day,
 no Klaus, nor most leaden Epimenides, only the Dead could
 continue sleeping; and so our miraculous Peter Klaus awakens.
 With what eyes, O Peter! Earth and sky have still their joyous
 July look, and the Champ-de-Mars is multitudinous with men: but
 the jubilee-huzzahing has become Bedlam-shrieking, of terror and
 revenge; not blessing of Talleyrand, or any blessing, but
 cursing, imprecation and shrill wail; our cannon-salvoes are
 turned to sharp shot; for swinging of incense-pans and
 Eighty-three Departmental Banners, we have waving of the one
 sanguinous _Drapeau-Rouge_.—Thou foolish Klaus! The one lay in
 the other, the one _was_ the other _minus_ Time; even as
 Hannibal’s rock-rending vinegar lay in the sweet new wine. That
 sweet Federation was of last year; this sour Divulsion is the
 self-same substance, only older by the appointed days. No miraculous Klaus or Epimenides sleeps in these times: and yet,
 may not many a man, if of due opacity and levity, act the same
 miracle in a natural way; we mean, with his eyes open? Eyes has
 he, but he sees not, except what is under his nose. With a
 sparkling briskness of glance, as if he not only saw but saw
 through, such a one goes whisking, assiduous, in his circle of
 officialities; not dreaming but that _it_ is the whole world: as,
 indeed, where your vision terminates, does not inanity begin
 _there_, and the world’s end clearly declares itself—to you?
 Whereby our brisk sparkling assiduous official person (call him,
 for instance, Lafayette), suddenly startled, after year and day,
 by huge grape-shot tumult, stares not less astonished at it than
 Peter Klaus would have done. Such natural-miracle Lafayette can
 perform; and indeed not he only but most other officials,
 non-officials, and generally the whole French People can perform
 it; and do bounce up, ever and anon, like amazed Seven-sleepers
 awakening; awakening amazed at the noise they themselves _make_.
 So strangely is Freedom, as we say, environed in Necessity; such
 a singular Somnambulism, of Conscious and Unconscious, of
 Voluntary and Involuntary, is this life of man. If any where in
 the world there was astonishment that the Federation Oath went
 into grape-shot, surely of all persons the French, first swearers
 and then shooters, felt astonished the most. Alas, offences must come. The sublime Feast of Pikes, with its
 effulgence of brotherly love, unknown since the Age of Gold, has
 changed nothing. That prurient heat in Twenty-five millions of
 hearts is not cooled thereby; but is still hot, nay hotter. Lift
 off the pressure of command from so many millions; all pressure
 or binding rule, except such melodramatic Federation Oath as they
 have bound _themselves_ with! For _Thou shalt_ was from of old
 the condition of man’s being, and his weal and blessedness was in
 obeying that. Wo for him when, were it on hest of the clearest
 necessity, rebellion, disloyal isolation, and mere _I will_,
 becomes his rule! But the Gospel of Jean-Jacques has come, and
 the first Sacrament of it has been celebrated: all things, as we
 say, are got into hot and hotter prurience; and must go on
 pruriently fermenting, in continual change noted or unnoted. “Worn out with disgusts,” Captain after Captain, in Royalist
 moustachioes, mounts his warhorse, or his Rozinante war-garron,
 and rides minatory across the Rhine; till all have ridden.
 Neither does civic Emigration cease: Seigneur after Seigneur
 must, in like manner, ride or roll; impelled to it, and even
 compelled. For the very Peasants despise him in that he dare not
 join his order and fight.[325] Can he bear to have a Distaff, a
 _Quenouille_ sent to him; say in copper-plate shadow, by post; or
 fixed up in wooden reality over his gate-lintel: as if he were no
 Hercules but an Omphale? Such scutcheon they forward to him
 diligently from behind the Rhine; till he too bestir himself and
 march, and in sour humour, another Lord of Land is gone, _not_
 taking the Land with him. Nay, what of Captains and emigrating
 Seigneurs? There is not an angry word on any of those Twenty-five
 million French tongues, and indeed not an angry thought in their
 hearts, but is some fraction of the great Battle. Add many
 successions of angry words together, you have the manual brawl;
 add brawls together, with the festering sorrows they leave, and
 they rise to riots and revolts. One reverend thing after another
 ceases to meet reverence: in visible material combustion, château
 after château mounts up; in spiritual invisible combustion, one
 authority after another. With noise and glare, or noisily and
 unnoted, a whole Old System of things is vanishing piecemeal: on
 the morrow thou shalt look and it is not.
 Chapter 2.3.II.
 The Wakeful. Sleep who will, cradled in hope and short vision, like Lafayette,
 “who always in the danger done sees the last danger that will
 threaten him,”—Time is not sleeping, nor Time’s seedfield. That sacred Herald’s-College of a _new_ Dynasty; we mean the
 Sixty and odd Billstickers with their leaden badges, are not
 sleeping. Daily they, with pastepot and cross-staff, new clothe
 the walls of Paris in colours of the rainbow: authoritative
 heraldic, as we say, or indeed almost magical thaumaturgic; for
 no Placard-Journal that they paste but will convince some soul or
 souls of man. The Hawkers bawl; and the Balladsingers: great
 Journalism blows and blusters, through all its throats, forth
 from Paris towards all corners of France, like an Aeolus’ Cave;
 keeping alive all manner of fires. Throats or Journals there are, as men count,[326] to the number
 of some hundred and thirty-three. Of various calibre; from your
 Chéniers, Gorsases, Camilles, down to your Marat, down now to
 your incipient Hébert of the _Père Duchesne;_ these blow, with
 fierce weight of argument or quick light banter, for the Rights
 of man: Durosoys, Royous, Peltiers, Sulleaus, equally with mixed
 tactics, inclusive, singular to say, of much profane Parody,[327]
 are blowing for Altar and Throne. As for Marat the
 People’s-Friend, his voice is as that of the bullfrog, or bittern
 by the solitary pools; he, unseen of men, croaks harsh thunder,
 and that alone continually,—of indignation, suspicion, incurable
 sorrow. The People are sinking towards ruin, near starvation
 itself: “My dear friends,” cries he, “your indigence is not the
 fruit of vices nor of idleness, you have a right to life, as good
 as Louis XVI., or the happiest of the century. What man can say
 he has a right to dine, when you have no bread?”[328] The People
 sinking on the one hand: on the other hand, nothing but wretched
 Sieur Motiers, treasonous Riquetti Mirabeaus; traitors, or else
 shadows, and simulacra of Quacks, to be seen in high places, look
 where you will! Men that go mincing, grimacing, with plausible
 speech and brushed raiment; hollow within: Quacks Political;
 Quacks scientific, Academical; all with a fellow-feeling for each
 other, and kind of Quack public-spirit! Not great Lavoisier
 himself, or any of the Forty can escape this rough tongue; which
 wants not fanatic sincerity, nor, strangest of all, a certain
 rough caustic sense. And then the “three thousand gaming-houses”
 that are in Paris; cesspools for the scoundrelism of the world;
 sinks of iniquity and debauchery,—whereas without good morals
 Liberty is impossible! There, in these Dens of Satan, which one
 knows, and perseveringly denounces, do Sieur Motier’s mouchards
 consort and colleague; battening vampyre-like on a People
 next-door to starvation. “_O Peuple!_” cries he oftimes, with
 heart-rending accent. Treason, delusion, vampyrism, scoundrelism,
 from Dan to Beersheba! The soul of Marat is sick with the sight:
 but what remedy? To erect “Eight Hundred gibbets,” in convenient
 rows, and proceed to hoisting; “Riquetti on the first of them!”
 Such is the brief recipe of Marat, Friend of the People. So blow and bluster the Hundred and thirty-three: nor, as would
 seem, are these sufficient; for there are benighted nooks in
 France, to which Newspapers do not reach; and every where is
 “such an appetite for news as was never seen in any country.” Let
 an expeditious Dampmartin, on furlough, set out to return home
 from Paris,[329] he cannot get along for “peasants stopping him
 on the highway; overwhelming him with questions:” the _Maître de
 Poste_ will not send out the horses till you have well nigh
 quarrelled with him, but asks always, What news? At Autun, “in
 spite of the rigorous frost” for it is now January, 1791, nothing
 will serve but you must gather your wayworn limbs, and thoughts,
 and “speak to the multitudes from a window opening into the
 market-place.” It is the shortest method: _This_, good Christian
 people, is verily what an August Assembly seemed to me to be
 doing; this and no other is the news;     “Now my weary lips I close;
     Leave me, leave me to repose.”
 The good Dampmartin!—But, on the whole, are not Nations
 astonishingly true to their National character; which indeed runs
 in the blood? Nineteen hundred years ago, Julius Cæsar, with his
 quick sure eye, took note how the Gauls waylaid men. “It is a
 habit of theirs,” says he, “to stop travellers, were it even by
 constraint, and inquire whatsoever each of them may have heard or
 known about any sort of matter: in their towns, the common people
 beset the passing trader; demanding to hear from what regions he
 came, what things he got acquainted with there. Excited by which
 rumours and hearsays they will decide about the weightiest
 matters; and necessarily repent next moment that they did it, on
 such guidance of uncertain reports, and many a traveller
 answering with mere fictions to please them, and get off.”[330]
 Nineteen hundred years; and good Dampmartin, wayworn, in winter
 frost, probably with scant light of stars and fish-oil, still
 perorates from the Inn-window! This People is no longer called
 Gaulish; and it has _wholly_ become _braccatus_, has got
 breeches, and suffered change enough: certain fierce German
 _Franken_ came storming over; and, so to speak, vaulted on the
 back of it; and always after, in their grim tenacious way, have
 ridden it bridled; for German is, by his very name, _Guerre_-man,
 or man that _wars_ and _gars_. And so the People, as we say, is
 now called French or Frankish: nevertheless, does not the old
 Gaulish and Gaelic Celthood, with its vehemence, effervescent
 promptitude, and what good and ill it had, still vindicate itself
 little adulterated?— For the rest, that in such prurient confusion, Clubbism thrives
 and spreads, need not be said. Already the Mother of Patriotism,
 sitting in the Jacobins, shines supreme over all; and has paled
 the poor lunar light of that Monarchic Club near to final
 extinction. She, we say, shines supreme, girt with sun-light, not
 yet with infernal lightning; reverenced, not without fear, by
 Municipal Authorities; counting her Barnaves, Lameths, Pétions,
 of a National Assembly; most gladly of all, her Robespierre.
 Cordeliers, again, your Hébert, Vincent, Bibliopolist Momoro,
 groan audibly that a tyrannous Mayor and Sieur Motier harrow them
 with the sharp _tribula_ of Law, intent apparently to suppress
 them by tribulation. How the Jacobin Mother-Society, as hinted
 formerly, sheds forth Cordeliers on this hand, and then Feuillans
 on that; the Cordeliers on this hand, and then Feuillans on that;
 the Cordeliers “an elixir or double-distillation of Jacobin
 Patriotism;” the other a wide-spread weak dilution thereof; how
 she will re-absorb the former into her Mother-bosom, and
 stormfully dissipate the latter into Nonentity: how she breeds
 and brings forth Three Hundred Daughter-Societies; her rearing of
 them, her correspondence, her endeavourings and continual
 travail: how, under an old figure, Jacobinism shoots forth
 organic filaments to the utmost corners of confused dissolved
 France; organising it anew:—this properly is the grand fact of
 the Time. To passionate Constitutionalism, still more to Royalism, which
 see all their own Clubs fail and die, Clubbism will naturally
 grow to seem the root of all evil. Nevertheless Clubbism is not
 death, but rather new organisation, and life out of death:
 destructive, indeed, of the remnants of the Old; but to the New
 important, indispensable. That man can co-operate and hold
 communion with man, herein lies his miraculous strength. In hut
 or hamlet, Patriotism mourns not now like voice in the desert: it
 can walk to the nearest Town; and there, in the Daughter-Society,
 make its ejaculation into an articulate oration, into an action,
 guided forward by the Mother of Patriotism herself. All Clubs of
 Constitutionalists, and such like, fail, one after another, as
 shallow fountains: Jacobinism alone has gone down to the deep
 subterranean lake of waters; and may, unless _filled in_, flow
 there, copious, continual, like an Artesian well. Till the Great
 Deep have drained itself up: and all be flooded and submerged,
 and Noah’s Deluge out-deluged! On the other hand, Claude Fauchet, preparing mankind for a Golden
 Age now apparently just at hand, has opened his _Cercle Social_,
 with clerks, corresponding boards, and so forth; in the precincts
 of the Palais Royal. It is _Te-Deum_ Fauchet; the same who
 preached on Franklin’s Death, in that huge Medicean rotunda of
 the _Halle aux bleds_. He here, this winter, by Printing-press
 and melodious Colloquy, spreads bruit of himself to the utmost
 City-barriers. “Ten thousand persons” of respectability attend
 there; and listen to this “_Procureur-Général de la Vérité_,
 Attorney-General of Truth,” so has he dubbed himself; to his sage
 Condorcet, or other eloquent coadjutor. Eloquent
 Attorney-General! He blows out from him, better or worse, what
 crude or ripe thing he holds: not without result to himself; for
 it leads to a Bishoprick, though only a Constitutional one.
 Fauchet approves himself a glib-tongued, strong-lunged,
 whole-hearted human individual: much flowing matter there is, and
 really of the better sort, about Right, Nature, Benevolence,
 Progress; which flowing matter, whether “it is pantheistic,” or
 is pot-theistic, only the greener mind, in these days, need read.
 Busy Brissot was long ago of purpose to establish precisely some
 such regenerative _Social Circle:_ nay he had tried it, in
 “Newman-street Oxford-street,” of the Fog Babylon; and failed,—as
 some say, surreptitiously pocketing the cash. Fauchet, not
 Brissot, was fated to be the happy man; whereat, however,
 generous Brissot will with sincere heart sing a timber-toned
 _Nunc Domine_.[331] But “ten thousand persons of respectability:”
 what a bulk have many things in proportion to their magnitude!
 This _Cercle Social_, for which Brissot chants in sincere
 timber-tones such _Nunc Domine_, what is it? Unfortunately wind
 and shadow. The main reality one finds in it now, is perhaps
 this: that an “Attorney-General of Truth” did once take shape of
 a body, as Son of Adam, on our Earth, though but for months or
 moments; and ten thousand persons of respectability attended, ere
 yet Chaos and Nox had reabsorbed him. Hundred and thirty-three Paris Journals; regenerative Social
 Circle; oratory, in Mother and Daughter Societies, from the
 balconies of Inns, by chimney-nook, at dinner-table,—polemical,
 ending many times in duel! Add ever, like a constant growling
 accompaniment of bass Discord: scarcity of work, scarcity of
 food. The winter is hard and cold; ragged Bakers’-queues, like a
 black tattered flag-of-distress, wave out ever and anon. It is
 the third of our Hunger-years this new year of a glorious
 Revolution. The rich man when invited to dinner, in such
 distress-seasons, feels bound in politeness to carry his own
 bread in his pocket: how the poor dine? And your glorious
 Revolution has done it, cries one. And our glorious Revolution is
 subtilety, by black traitors worthy of the Lamp-iron, _perverted_
 to do it, cries another! Who will paint the huge whirlpool
 wherein France, all shivered into wild incoherence, whirls? The
 jarring that went on under every French roof, in every French
 heart; the diseased things that were spoken, done, the sum-total
 whereof is the French Revolution, tongue of man cannot tell. Nor
 the laws of action that work unseen in the depths of that huge
 blind Incoherence! With amazement, not with measurement, men look
 on the Immeasurable; not knowing its laws; _seeing_, with all
 different degrees of knowledge, what new phases, and results of
 event, its laws bring forth. France is as a monstrous Galvanic
 Mass, wherein all sorts of far stranger than chemical galvanic or
 electric forces and substances are at work; electrifying one
 another, positive and negative; filling with electricity your
 Leyden-jars,—Twenty-five millions in number! As the jars get
 full, there will, from time to time, be, on slight hint, an
 explosion.
 Chapter 2.3.III.
 Sword in Hand. On such wonderful basis, however, has Law, Royalty, Authority,
 and whatever yet exists of visible Order, to maintain itself,
 while it can. Here, as in that Commixture of the Four Elements
 did the Anarch Old, has an august Assembly spread its pavilion;
 curtained by the dark infinite of discords; founded on the
 wavering bottomless of the Abyss; and keeps continual hubbub.
 Time is around it, and Eternity, and the Inane; and it does what
 it can, what is given it to do. Glancing reluctantly in, once more, we discern little that is
 edifying: a Constitutional Theory of Defective Verbs struggling
 forward, with perseverance, amid endless interruptions: Mirabeau,
 from his tribune, with the weight of his name and genius, awing
 down much Jacobin violence; which in return vents itself the
 louder over in its Jacobins Hall, and even reads him sharp
 lectures there.[332] This man’s path is mysterious, questionable;
 difficult, and he walks without companion in it. Pure Patriotism
 does not now count him among her chosen; pure Royalism abhors
 him: yet his weight with the world is overwhelming. Let him
 travel on, companionless, unwavering, whither he is bound,—while
 it is yet day with him, and the night has not come. But the chosen band of pure Patriot brothers is small; counting
 only some Thirty, seated now on the extreme tip of the Left,
 separate from the world. A virtuous Pétion; an incorruptible
 Robespierre, most consistent, incorruptible of thin acrid men;
 Triumvirs Barnave, Duport, Lameth, great in speech, thought,
 action, each according to his kind; a lean old Goupil de Prefeln:
 on these and what will follow them has pure Patriotism to depend. There too, conspicuous among the Thirty, if seldom audible,
 Philippe d’Orléans may be seen sitting: in dim fuliginous
 bewilderment; having, one might say, _arrived_ at Chaos! Gleams
 there are, at once of a Lieutenancy and Regency; debates in the
 Assembly itself, of succession to the Throne “in case the present
 Branch should fail;” and Philippe, they say, walked anxiously, in
 silence, through the corridors, till such high argument were
 done: but it came all to nothing; Mirabeau, glaring into the man,
 and through him, had to ejaculate in strong untranslatable
 language: _Ce j—f—ne vaut pas la peine qu’on se donne pour lui_.
 It came all to nothing; and in the meanwhile Philippe’s money,
 they say, is gone! Could he refuse a little cash to the gifted
 Patriot, in want only of that; he himself in want of all _but_
 that? Not a pamphlet can be printed without cash; or indeed
 written, without food purchasable by cash. Without cash your
 hopefullest Projector cannot stir from the spot: individual
 patriotic or other Projects require cash: how much more do
 wide-spread Intrigues, which live and exist by cash; lying
 widespread, with dragon-appetite for cash; fit to swallow
 Princedoms! And so Prince Philippe, amid his Sillerys, Lacloses,
 and confused Sons of Night, has rolled along: the centre of the
 strangest cloudy coil; out of which has visibly come, as we often
 say, an Epic Preternatural Machinery of SUSPICION; and _within_
 which there has dwelt and worked,—what specialties of treason,
 stratagem, aimed or aimless endeavour towards mischief, no party
 living (if it be not the Presiding Genius of it, Prince of the
 Power of the Air) has now any chance to know. Camille’s
 conjecture is the likeliest: that poor Philippe did mount up, a
 little way, in treasonable speculation, as he mounted formerly in
 one of the earliest Balloons; but, frightened at the new position
 he was getting into, had soon turned the cock again, and come
 down. More fool than he rose! To create Preternatural Suspicion,
 this was his function in the Revolutionary Epos. But now if he
 have lost his cornucopia of ready-money, what else had he to
 lose? In thick darkness, inward and outward, he must welter and
 flounder on, in that piteous death-element, the hapless man.
 Once, or even twice, we shall still behold him emerged;
 struggling out of the thick death-element: in vain. For one
 moment, it is the last moment, he starts aloft, or is flung
 aloft, even into clearness and a kind of memorability,—to sink
 then for evermore! The _Côté Droit_ persists no less; nay with more animation than
 ever, though hope has now well nigh fled. Tough Abbé Maury, when
 the obscure country Royalist grasps his hand with transport of
 thanks, answers, rolling his indomitable brazen head: ‘_Hélas,
 Monsieur_, all that I do here is as good as simply _nothing_.’
 Gallant Faussigny, visible this one time in History, advances
 frantic, into the middle of the Hall, exclaiming: ‘There is but
 one way of dealing with it, and that is to fall sword in hand on
 those gentry there, _sabre à la main sur ces gaillards là_,’[333]
 franticly indicating our chosen Thirty on the extreme tip of the
 Left! Whereupon is clangour and clamour, debate,
 repentance,—evaporation. Things ripen towards downright
 incompatibility, and what is called “scission:” that fierce
 theoretic onslaught of Faussigny’s was in August, 1790; next
 August will not have come, till a famed Two Hundred and
 Ninety-two, the chosen of Royalism, make solemn final “scission”
 from an Assembly given up to faction; and depart, shaking the
 dust off their feet. Connected with this matter of sword in hand, there is yet another
 thing to be noted. Of duels we have sometimes spoken: how, in all
 parts of France, innumerable duels were fought; and argumentative
 men and messmates, flinging down the wine-cup and weapons of
 reason and repartee, met in the measured field; to part bleeding;
 or perhaps _not_ to part, but to fall mutually skewered through
 with iron, their wrath and life alike ending,—and die as fools
 die. Long has this lasted, and still lasts. But now it would seem
 as if in an august Assembly itself, traitorous Royalism, in its
 despair, had taken to a new course: that of cutting off
 Patriotism by systematic duel! Bully-swordsmen, “_Spadassins_” of
 that party, go swaggering; or indeed they can be had for a trifle
 of money. “Twelve _Spadassins_” were _seen_, by the yellow eye of
 Journalism, “arriving recently out of Switzerland;” also “a
 considerable number of Assassins, _nombre considérable
 d’assassins_, exercising in fencing-schools and at
 pistol-targets.” Any Patriot Deputy of mark can be called out;
 let him escape one time, or ten times, a time there necessarily
 is when he must fall, and France mourn. How many cartels has
 Mirabeau had; especially while he was the People’s champion!
 Cartels by the hundred: which he, since the Constitution must be
 made first, and his time is precious, answers now always with a
 kind of stereotype formula: ‘Monsieur, you are put upon my List;
 but I warn you that it is long, and I grant no preferences.’ Then, in Autumn, had we not the Duel of Cazalès and Barnave; the
 two chief masters of tongue-shot meeting now to exchange
 pistol-shot? For Cazalès, chief of the Royalists, whom we call
 “Blacks or _Noirs_,” said, in a moment of passion, ‘the Patriots
 were sheer Brigands,’ nay in so speaking, he darted or seemed to
 dart, a fire-glance specially at Barnave; who thereupon could not
 but reply by fire-glances,—by adjournment to the
 Bois-de-Boulogne. Barnave’s second shot took effect: on Cazalès’s
 _hat_. The “front nook” of a triangular Felt, such as mortals
 then wore, deadened the ball; and saved that fine brow from more
 than temporary injury. But how easily might the lot have fallen
 the other way, and Barnave’s hat not been so good! Patriotism
 raises its loud denunciation of Duelling in general; petitions an
 august Assembly to stop such Feudal barbarism by law. Barbarism
 and solecism: for will it convince or convict any man to blow
 half an ounce of lead through the head of him? Surely
 not.—Barnave was received at the Jacobins with embraces, yet with
 rebukes. Mindful of which, and also that his repetition in America was
 that of headlong foolhardiness rather, and want of brain not of
 heart, Charles Lameth does, on the eleventh day of November, with
 little emotion, decline attending some hot young Gentleman from
 Artois, come expressly to challenge him: nay indeed he first
 coldly engages to attend; then coldly permits two Friends to
 attend instead of him, and shame the young Gentleman out of it,
 which they successfully do. A cold procedure; satisfactory to the
 two Friends, to Lameth and the hot young Gentleman; whereby, one
 might have fancied, the whole matter was cooled down. Not so, however: Lameth, proceeding to his senatorial duties, in
 the decline of the day, is met in those Assembly corridors by
 nothing but Royalist _brocards;_ sniffs, huffs, and open insults.
 Human patience has its limits: ‘Monsieur,’ said Lameth, breaking
 silence to one Lautrec, a man with hunchback, or natural
 deformity, but sharp of tongue, and a _Black_ of the deepest
 tint, ‘Monsieur, if you were a man to be fought with!’—‘I am
 one,’ cries the young Duke de Castries. Fast as fire-flash Lameth
 replies, ‘_Tout à l’heure_, On the instant, then!’ And so, as the
 shades of dusk thicken in that Bois-de-Boulogne, we behold two
 men with lion-look, with alert attitude, side foremost, right
 foot advanced; flourishing and thrusting, stoccado and passado,
 in tierce and quart; intent to skewer one another. See, with most
 skewering purpose, headlong Lameth, with his whole weight, makes
 a furious lunge; but deft Castries whisks aside: Lameth skewers
 only the air,—and slits deep and far, on Castries’ sword’s-point,
 his own extended left arm! Whereupon with bleeding, pallor,
 surgeon’s-lint, and formalities, the Duel is considered
 satisfactorily done. But will there be no end, then? Beloved Lameth lies deep-slit,
 not out of danger. Black traitorous Aristocrats kill the People’s
 defenders, cut up not with arguments, but with rapier-slits. And
 the Twelve _Spadassins_ out of Switzerland, and the considerable
 number of Assassins exercising at the pistol-target? So meditates
 and ejaculates hurt Patriotism, with ever-deepening ever-widening
 fervour, for the space of six and thirty hours. The thirty-six hours past, on Saturday the 13th, one beholds a
 new spectacle: The Rue de Varennes, and neighbouring Boulevard
 des Invalides, covered with a mixed flowing multitude: the
 Castries Hotel gone distracted, devil-ridden, belching from every
 window, “beds with clothes and curtains,” plate of silver and
 gold with filigree, mirrors, pictures, images, commodes,
 chiffoniers, and endless crockery and jingle: amid steady popular
 cheers, absolutely without theft; for there goes a cry, ‘He shall
 be hanged that steals a nail!’ It is a _Plebiscitum_, or informal
 iconoclastic Decree of the Common People, in the course of being
 executed!—The Municipality sit tremulous; deliberating whether
 they will hang out the _Drapeau Rouge_ and Martial Law: National
 Assembly, part in loud wail, part in hardly suppressed applause:
 Abbé Maury unable to decide whether the iconoclastic Plebs amount
 to forty thousand or to two hundred thousand. Deputations, swift messengers, for it is at a distance over the
 River, come and go. Lafayette and National Guardes, though
 without _Drapeau Rouge_, get under way; apparently in no hot
 haste. Nay, arrived on the scene, Lafayette salutes with doffed
 hat, before ordering to fix bayonets. What avails it? The
 Plebeian ‘Court of _Cassation_,’ as Camille might punningly name
 it, has done its work; steps forth, with unbuttoned vest, with
 pockets turned inside out: sack, and just ravage, not plunder!
 With inexhaustible patience, the Hero of two Worlds remonstrates;
 persuasively, with a kind of sweet constraint, though also with
 fixed bayonets, dissipates, hushes down: on the morrow it is once
 more all as usual. Considering which things, however, Duke Castries may justly
 “write to the President,” justly transport himself across the
 Marches; to raise a corps, or do what else is in him. Royalism
 totally abandons that Bobadilian method of contest, and the
 Twelve _Spadassins_ return to Switzerland,—or even to Dreamland
 through the Horn-gate, whichsoever their home is. Nay Editor
 Prudhomme is authorised to publish a curious thing: “We are
 authorised to publish,” says he, dull-blustering Publisher, that
 M. Boyer, champion of good Patriots, is at the head of Fifty
 _Spadassinicides_ or Bully-_killers_. His address is: Passage du
 Bois-de-Boulonge, Faubourg St. Denis.”[334] One of the strangest
 Institutes, this of Champion Boyer and the Bully-killers! Whose
 services, however, are not wanted; Royalism having abandoned the
 rapier-method as plainly impracticable.

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' The truth is Royalism sees itself verging towards sad
 extremities; nearer and nearer daily. From over the Rhine it
 comes asserted that the King in his Tuileries is not free: this
 the poor King may contradict, with the official mouth, but in his
 heart feels often to be undeniable. Civil Constitution of the
 Clergy; Decree of ejectment against Dissidents from it: not even
 to this latter, though almost his conscience rebels, can he say
 “Nay; but, after two months’ hesitating, signs this also. It was
 on January 21st,” of this 1790, that he signed it; to the sorrow
 of his poor/ heart yet, on _another_ Twenty-first of January!
 Whereby come Dissident ejected Priests; unconquerable Martyrs
 according to some, incurable chicaning Traitors according to
 others. And so there has arrived what we once foreshadowed: with
 Religion, or with the Cant and Echo of Religion, all France is
 rent asunder in a new rupture of continuity; complicating,
 embittering all the older;—to be cured only, by stern surgery, in
 La Vendée! Unhappy Royalty, unhappy Majesty, Hereditary (Representative),
 _Représentant Héréditaire_, or however they can name him; of whom
 much is expected, to whom little is given! Blue National Guards
 encircle that Tuileries; a Lafayette, thin constitutional Pedant;
 clear, thin, inflexible, as water, turned to thin ice; whom no
 Queen’s heart can love. National Assembly, its pavilion spread
 where we know, sits near by, keeping continual hubbub. From
 without nothing but Nanci Revolts, sack of Castries Hotels, riots
 and seditions; riots, North and South, at Aix, at Douai, at
 Béfort, Usez, Perpignan, at Nismes, and that incurable Avignon of
 the Pope’s: a continual crackling and sputtering of riots from
 the whole face of France;—testifying how electric it grows. Add
 only the hard winter, the famished _strikes_ of operatives; that
 continual running-bass of Scarcity, ground-tone and basis of all
 other Discords! The plan of Royalty, so far as it can be said to have any fixed
 plan, is still, as ever, that of flying towards the frontiers. In
 very truth, the only plan of the smallest promise for it! Fly to
 Bouillé; bristle yourself round with cannon, served by your
 “forty-thousand undebauched Germans:” summon the National
 Assembly to follow you, summon what of it is Royalist,
 Constitutional, gainable by money; dissolve the rest, by
 grapeshot if need be. Let Jacobinism and Revolt, with one wild
 wail, fly into Infinite Space; driven by grapeshot. Thunder over
 France with the cannon’s mouth; commanding, not entreating, that
 this riot cease. And then to rule afterwards with utmost possible
 Constitutionality; doing justice, loving mercy; _being_ Shepherd
 of this indigent People, not Shearer merely, and
 Shepherd’s-similitude! All this, if ye dare. If ye dare not, then
 in Heaven’s name go to sleep: other handsome alternative seems
 none. Nay, it were perhaps possible; with a man to do it. For if such
 inexpressible whirlpool of Babylonish confusions (which our Era
 is) cannot be stilled by man, but only by Time and men, a man may
 moderate its paroxysms, may balance and sway, and keep himself
 unswallowed on the top of it,—as several men and Kings in these
 days do. Much is possible for a man; men will obey a man that
 _kens_ and _cans_, and name him reverently their _Ken-ning_ or
 King. Did not Charlemagne rule? Consider too whether he had
 smooth times of it; hanging “thirty-thousand Saxons over the
 Weser-Bridge,” at one dread swoop! So likewise, who knows but, in
 this same distracted fanatic France, the right man may verily
 exist? An olive-complexioned taciturn man; for the present,
 Lieutenant in the Artillery-service, who once sat studying
 Mathematics at Brienne? The same who walked in the morning to
 correct proof-sheets at Dôle, and enjoyed a frugal breakfast with
 M. Joly? Such a one is gone, whither also famed General Paoli his
 friend is gone, in these very days, to see old scenes in native
 Corsica, and what Democratic good can be done there. Royalty never executes the evasion-plan, yet never abandons it;
 living in variable hope; undecisive, till fortune shall decide.
 In utmost secrecy, a brisk Correspondence goes on with Bouillé;
 there is also a plot, which emerges more than once, for carrying
 the King to Rouen:[335] plot after plot, emerging and submerging,
 like “_ignes fatui_ in foul weather, which lead no whither. About
 “ten o’clock at night,” the Hereditary Representative, in _partie
 quarrée_, with the Queen, with Brother Monsieur, and Madame, sits
 playing “_wisk_,” or whist. Usher Campan enters mysteriously,
 with a message he only half comprehends: How a certain Compte
 d’Inisdal waits anxious in the outer antechamber; National
 Colonel, Captain of the watch for this night, is gained over;
 post-horses ready all the way; party of Noblesse sitting armed,
 determined; will His Majesty, before midnight, consent to go?
 Profound silence; Campan waiting with upturned ear. ‘Did your
 Majesty hear what Campan said?’ asks the Queen. ‘Yes, I heard,’
 answers Majesty, and plays on. ‘’Twas a pretty couplet, that of
 Campan’s,’ hints Monsieur, who at times showed a pleasant wit:
 Majesty, still unresponsive, plays wisk. ‘After all, one must say
 something to Campan,’ remarks the Queen. ‘Tell M. d’Inisdal,’
 said the King, and the Queen puts an emphasis on it, ‘that the
 King cannot _consent_ to be forced away.’—‘I see!’ said
 d’Inisdal, whisking round, peaking himself into flame of
 irritancy: ‘we have the risk; we are to have all the blame if it
 fail,’[336]—and vanishes, he and his plot, as will-o’-wisps do.
 The Queen sat till far in the night, packing jewels: but it came
 to nothing; in that peaked frame of irritancy the Will-o’-wisp
 had gone _out_. Little hope there is in all this. Alas, with whom to fly? Our
 loyal _Gardes-du-Corps_, ever since the Insurrection of Women,
 are disbanded; gone to their homes; gone, many of them, across
 the Rhine towards Coblentz and Exiled Princes: brave Miomandre
 and brave Tardivet, these faithful Two, have received, in
 nocturnal interview with both Majesties, their _viaticum_ of gold
 louis, of heartfelt thanks from a Queen’s lips, though unluckily
 “his Majesty stood, back to fire, not speaking;”[337] and do now
 dine through the Provinces; recounting hairsbreadth escapes,
 insurrectionary horrors. Great horrors; to be swallowed yet of
 greater. But on the whole what a falling off from the old
 splendour of Versailles! Here in this poor Tuileries, a National
 Brewer-Colonel, sonorous Santerre, parades officially behind her
 Majesty’s chair. Our high dignitaries, all fled over the Rhine:
 nothing now to be gained at Court; but hopes, for which life
 itself must be risked! Obscure busy men frequent the back stairs;
 with hearsays, wind projects, unfruitful fanfaronades. Young
 Royalists, at the _Théâtre de Vaudeville_, “sing couplets;” if
 that could do any thing. Royalists enough, Captains on furlough,
 burnt-out Seigneurs, may likewise be met with, “in the Café de
 Valois, and at Méot the Restaurateur’s.” There they fan one
 another into high loyal glow; drink, in such wine as can be
 procured, confusion to Sansculottism; shew purchased dirks, of an
 improved structure, made to order; and, greatly daring,
 dine.[338] It is in these places, in these months, that the
 epithet _Sansculotte_ first gets applied to indigent Patriotism;
 in the last age we had Gilbert _Sansculotte_, the indigent
 Poet.[339] Destitute-of-Breeches: a mournful Destitution; which
 however, if Twenty millions share it, may become more effective
 than most Possessions! Meanwhile, amid this vague dim whirl of fanfaronades,
 wind-projects, poniards made to order, there does disclose itself
 one _punctum-saliens_ of life and feasibility: the finger of
 Mirabeau! Mirabeau and the Queen of France have met; have parted
 with mutual trust! It is strange; secret as the Mysteries; but it
 is indubitable. Mirabeau took horse, one evening; and rode
 westward, unattended,—to see Friend Clavière in that country
 house of his? Before getting to Clavière’s, the much-musing
 horseman struck aside to a back gate of the Garden of
 Saint-Cloud: some Duke d’Aremberg, or the like, was there to
 introduce him; the Queen was not far: on a “round knoll, _rond
 point_, the highest of the Garden of Saint-Cloud,” he beheld the
 Queen’s face; spake with her, alone, under the void canopy of
 Night. What an interview; fateful secret for us, after all
 searching; like the colloquies of the gods![340] She called him
 “a Mirabeau:” elsewhere we read that she “was charmed with him,”
 the wild submitted Titan; as indeed it is among the honourable
 tokens of this high ill-fated heart that no mind of any
 endowment, no Mirabeau, nay no Barnave, no Dumouriez, ever came
 face to face with her but, in spite of all prepossessions, she
 was forced to recognise it, to draw nigh to it, with trust. High
 imperial heart; with the instinctive attraction towards all that
 had any height! ‘You know not the Queen,’ said Mirabeau once in
 confidence; ‘her force of mind is prodigious; she is a man for
 courage.’[341]—And so, under the void Night, on the crown of that
 knoll, she has spoken with a Mirabeau: he has kissed loyally the
 queenly hand, and said with enthusiasm: ‘Madame, the Monarchy is
 saved!’—Possible? The Foreign Powers, mysteriously sounded, gave
 favourable guarded response;[342] Bouillé is at Metz, and could
 find forty-thousand sure Germans. With a Mirabeau for head, and a
 Bouillé for hand, something verily is possible,—if Fate intervene
 not. But figure under what thousandfold wrappages, and cloaks of
 darkness, Royalty, meditating these things, must involve itself.
 There are men with “Tickets of Entrance;” there are chivalrous
 consultings, mysterious plottings. Consider also whether, involve
 as it like, plotting Royalty can escape the glance of Patriotism;
 lynx-eyes, by the ten thousand fixed on it, which see in the
 dark! Patriotism knows much: know the dirks made to order, and
 can specify the shops; knows Sieur Motier’s legions of mouchards;
 the Tickets of _Entrée_, and men in black; and how plan of
 evasion succeeds plan,—or may be supposed to succeed it. Then
 conceive the couplets chanted at the _Théâtre de Vaudeville;_ or
 worse, the whispers, significant nods of traitors in moustaches.
 Conceive, on the other hand, the loud cry of alarm that came
 through the Hundred-and-Thirty Journals; the Dionysius’-Ear of
 each of the Forty-eight Sections, wakeful night and day. Patriotism is patient of much; not patient of all. The _Café de
 Procope_ has sent, visibly along the streets, a Deputation of
 Patriots, “to expostulate with bad Editors,” by trustful word of
 mouth: singular to see and hear. The bad Editors promise to
 amend, but do not. Deputations for change of Ministry were many;
 Mayor Bailly joining even with Cordelier Danton in such: and they
 have prevailed. With what profit? Of Quacks, willing or
 constrained to be Quacks, the race is everlasting: Ministers
 Duportail and Dutertre will have to manage much as Ministers
 Latour-du-Pin and Cicé did. So welters the confused world. But now, beaten on for ever by such inextricable contradictory
 influences and evidences, what is the indigent French Patriot, in
 these unhappy days, to believe, and walk by? Uncertainty all;
 except that he is wretched, indigent; that a glorious Revolution,
 the wonder of the Universe, has hitherto brought neither Bread
 nor Peace; being marred by traitors, difficult to discover.
 Traitors that dwell in the dark, invisible there;—or seen for
 moments, in pallid dubious twilight, stealthily vanishing
 thither! Preternatural Suspicion once more rules the minds of
 men. “Nobody here,” writes Carra of the _Annales Patriotiques_, so
 early as the first of February, “can entertain a doubt of the
 constant obstinate project these people have on foot to get the
 King away; or of the perpetual succession of manœuvres they
 employ for that.” Nobody: the watchful Mother of Patriotism
 deputed two Members to her Daughter at Versailles, to examine how
 the matter looked there. Well, and there? Patriotic Carra
 continues: “The Report of these two deputies we all heard with
 our own ears last Saturday. They went with others of Versailles,
 to inspect the King’s Stables, also the stables of the whilom
 _Gardes du Corps;_ they found there from seven to eight hundred
 horses standing always saddled and bridled, ready for the road at
 a moment’s notice. The same deputies, moreover, saw with their
 own two eyes several Royal Carriages, which men were even then
 busy loading with large well-stuffed luggage-bags,” leather cows,
 as we call them, “_vaches de cuir;_ the Royal Arms on the panels
 almost entirely effaced.” Momentous enough! Also, “on the same
 day the whole _Maréchaussée_, or Cavalry Police, did assemble
 with arms, horses and baggage,”—and disperse again. They want the
 King over the marches, that so Emperor Leopold and the German
 Princes, whose troops are ready, may have a pretext for
 beginning: “this,” adds Carra, “is the word of the riddle: this
 is the reason why our fugitive Aristocrats are now making levies
 of men on the frontiers; expecting that, one of these mornings,
 the Executive Chief Magistrate will be brought over to them, and
 the civil war commence.”[343] If indeed the Executive Chief Magistrate, bagged, say in one of
 these leather _cows_, were once brought safe over to them! But
 the strangest thing of all is that Patriotism, whether barking at
 a venture, or guided by some instinct of preternatural sagacity,
 is actually barking _aright_ this time; at something, not at
 nothing. Bouillé’s Secret Correspondence, since made public,
 testifies as much. Nay, it is undeniable, visible to all, that _Mesdames_ the King’s
 Aunts are taking steps for departure: asking passports of the
 Ministry, safe-conducts of the Municipality; which Marat warns
 all men to beware of. They will carry gold with them, “these old
 _Béguines;_” nay they will carry the little Dauphin, “having
 nursed a changeling, for some time, to leave in his stead!”
 Besides, they are as some light substance flung up, to shew how
 the wind sits; a kind of proof-kite you fly off to ascertain
 whether the grand paper-kite, Evasion of the King, may mount! In these alarming circumstances, Patriotism is not wanting to
 itself. Municipality deputes to the King; Sections depute to the
 Municipality; a National Assembly will soon stir. Meanwhile,
 behold, on the 19th of February 1791, Mesdames, quitting Bellevue
 and Versailles with all privacy, are off! Towards Rome,
 seemingly; or one knows not whither. They are not without King’s
 passports, countersigned; and what is more to the purpose, a
 serviceable Escort. The Patriotic Mayor or Mayorlet of the
 Village of Moret tried to detain them; but brisk Louis de
 Narbonne, of the Escort, dashed off at hand-gallop; returned soon
 with thirty dragoons, and victoriously cut them out. And so the
 poor ancient women go their way; to the terror of France and
 Paris, whose nervous excitability is become extreme. Who else
 would hinder poor _Loque_ and _Graille_, now grown so old, and
 fallen into such unexpected circumstances, when gossip itself
 turning only on terrors and horrors is no longer pleasant to the
 mind, and you cannot get so much as an orthodox confessor in
 peace,—from going what way soever the hope of any solacement
 might lead them? They go, poor ancient dames,—whom the heart were hard that does
 not pity: they go; with palpitations, with unmelodious suppressed
 screechings; all France, screeching and cackling, in loud
 _un_suppressed terror, behind and on both hands of them: such
 mutual suspicion is among men. At Arnay le Duc, above halfway to
 the frontiers, a Patriotic Municipality and Populace again takes
 courage to stop them: Louis Narbonne must now back to Paris, must
 consult the National Assembly. National Assembly answers, not
 without an effort, that Mesdames may go. Whereupon Paris rises
 worse than ever, screeching half-distracted. Tuileries and
 precincts are filled with women and men, while the National
 Assembly debates this question of questions; Lafayette is needed
 at night for dispersing them, and the streets are to be
 illuminated. Commandant Berthier, a Berthier before whom are
 great things unknown, lies for the present under blockade at
 Bellevue in Versailles. By no tactics could he get Mesdames’
 Luggage stirred from the Courts there; frantic Versaillese women
 came screaming about him; his very troops cut the waggon-traces;
 he retired to the interior, waiting better times.[344] Nay, in these same hours, while Mesdames hardly cut out from
 Moret by the sabre’s edge, are driving rapidly, to foreign parts,
 and not yet stopped at Arnay, their august nephew poor Monsieur,
 at Paris has dived deep into his cellars of the Luxembourg for
 shelter; and according to Montgaillard can hardly be persuaded up
 again. Screeching multitudes environ that Luxembourg of his:
 drawn thither by report of his departure: but, at sight and sound
 of Monsieur, they become crowing multitudes; and escort Madame
 and him to the Tuileries with vivats.[345] It is a state of
 nervous excitability such as few Nations know.
 Chapter 2.3.V.
 The Day of Poniards. Or, again, what means this visible reparation of the Castle of
 Vincennes? Other Jails being all crowded with prisoners, new
 space is wanted here: that is the Municipal account. For in such
 changing of Judicatures, Parlements being abolished, and New
 Courts but just set up, prisoners have accumulated. Not to say
 that in these times of discord and club-law, offences and
 committals are, at any rate, more numerous. Which Municipal
 account, does it not sufficiently explain the phenomenon? Surely,
 to repair the Castle of Vincennes was of all enterprises that an
 enlightened Municipality could undertake, the most innocent. Not so however does neighbouring Saint-Antoine look on it:
 Saint-Antoine to whom these peaked turrets and grim donjons,
 all-too near her own dark dwelling, are of themselves an offence.
 Was not Vincennes a kind of minor Bastille? Great Diderot and
 Philosophes have lain in durance here; great Mirabeau, in
 disastrous eclipse, for forty-two months. And now when the old
 Bastille has become a dancing-ground (had any one the mirth to
 dance), and its stones are getting built into the Pont
 Louis-Seize, does this minor, comparative insignificance of a
 Bastille flank itself with fresh-hewn mullions, spread out
 tyrannous wings; menacing Patriotism? New space for prisoners:
 and what prisoners? A d’Orléans, with the chief Patriots on the
 tip of the Left? It is said, there runs “a subterranean passage”
 all the way from the Tuileries hither. Who knows? Paris, mined
 with quarries and catacombs, does hang wondrous over the abyss;
 Paris was once to be blown up,—though the powder, when we went to
 look, had got withdrawn. A Tuileries, sold to Austria and
 Coblentz, should have no subterranean passage. Out of which might
 not Coblentz or Austria issue, some morning; and, with cannon of
 long range, “_foudroyer_,” bethunder a patriotic Saint-Antoine
 into smoulder and ruin! So meditates the benighted soul of Saint-Antoine, as it sees the
 aproned workmen, in early spring, busy on these towers. An
 official-speaking Municipality, a Sieur Motier with his legions
 of _mouchards_, deserve no trust at all. Were Patriot Santerre,
 indeed, Commander! But the sonorous Brewer commands only our own
 Battalion: of such secrets he can explain nothing, knows nothing,
 perhaps suspects much. And so the work goes on; and afflicted
 benighted Saint-Antoine hears rattle of hammers, sees stones
 suspended in air.[346] Saint-Antoine prostrated the first great Bastille: will it falter
 over this comparative insignificance of a Bastille? Friends, what
 if we took pikes, firelocks, sledgehammers; and helped
 ourselves!—Speedier is no remedy; nor so certain. On the 28th day
 of February, Saint-Antoine turns out, as it has now often done;
 and, apparently with little superfluous tumult, moves eastward to
 that eye-sorrow of Vincennes. With grave voice of authority, no
 need of bullying and shouting, Saint-Antoine signifies to parties
 concerned there that its purpose is, To have this suspicious
 Stronghold razed level with the general soil of the country.
 Remonstrance may be proffered, with zeal: but it avails not. The
 outer gate goes up, drawbridges tumble; iron window-stanchions,
 smitten out with sledgehammers, become iron-crowbars: it rains
 furniture, stone-masses, slates: with chaotic clatter and rattle,
 Demolition clatters down. And now hasty expresses rush through
 the agitated streets, to warn Lafayette, and the Municipal and
 Departmental Authorities; Rumour warns a National Assembly, a
 Royal Tuileries, and all men who care to hear it: That
 Saint-Antoine is up; that Vincennes, and probably the last
 remaining Institution of the Country, is coming down.[347] Quick, then! Let Lafayette roll his drums and fly eastward; for
 to all Constitutional Patriots this is again bad news. And you,
 ye Friends of Royalty, snatch your poniards of improved
 structure, made to order; your sword-canes, secret arms, and
 tickets of entry; quick, by backstairs passages, rally round the
 Son of Sixty Kings. An effervescence probably got up by d’Orléans
 and Company, for the overthrow of Throne and Altar: it is said
 her Majesty shall be put in prison, put out of the way; what then
 will _his_ Majesty be? Clay for the Sansculottic Potter! Or were
 it impossible to fly this day; a brave Noblesse suddenly all
 rallying? Peril threatens, hope invites: Dukes de Villequier, de
 Duras, Gentlemen of the Chamber give tickets and admittance; a
 brave Noblesse is suddenly all rallying. Now were the time to
 “fall sword in hand on those gentry there,” could it be done with
 effect. The Hero of two Worlds is on his white charger; blue Nationals,
 horse and foot, hurrying eastward: Santerre, with the
 Saint-Antoine Battalion, is already there,—apparently indisposed
 to act. Heavy-laden Hero of two Worlds, what tasks are these! The
 jeerings, provocative gambollings of that Patriot Suburb, which
 is all out on the streets now, are hard to endure; unwashed
 Patriots jeering in sulky sport; one unwashed Patriot “seizing
 the General by the boot” to unhorse him. Santerre, ordered to
 fire, makes answer obliquely, ‘These are the men that took the
 Bastille;’ and not a trigger stirs! Neither dare the Vincennes
 Magistracy give warrant of arrestment, or the smallest
 countenance: wherefore the General “will take it on himself” to
 arrest. By promptitude, by cheerful adroitness, patience and
 brisk valour without limits, the riot may be again bloodlessly
 appeased. Meanwhile, the rest of Paris, with more or less unconcern, may
 mind the rest of its business: for what is this but an
 effervescence, of which there are now so many? The National
 Assembly, in one of its stormiest moods, is debating a Law
 against Emigration; Mirabeau declaring aloud, ‘I swear beforehand
 that I will not obey it.’ Mirabeau is often at the Tribune this
 day; with endless impediments from without; with the old unabated
 energy from within. What can murmurs and clamours, from Left or
 from Right, do to this man; like Teneriffe or Atlas unremoved?
 With clear thought; with strong bass-voice, though at first low,
 uncertain, he claims audience, sways the storm of men: anon the
 sound of him waxes, softens; he rises into far-sounding melody of
 strength, triumphant, which subdues all hearts; his rude-seamed
 face, desolate fire-scathed, becomes fire-lit, and radiates: once
 again men feel, in these beggarly ages, what is the potency and
 omnipotency of man’s word on the souls of men. ‘I will triumph or
 be torn in fragments,’ he was once heard to say. ‘Silence,’ he
 cries now, in strong word of command, in imperial consciousness
 of strength, ‘Silence, the thirty voices, _Silence aux trente
 voix!_’—and Robespierre and the Thirty Voices die into
 mutterings; and the Law is once more as Mirabeau would have it. How different, at the same instant, is General Lafayette’s street
 eloquence; wrangling with sonorous Brewers, with an ungrammatical
 Saint-Antoine! Most different, again, from both is the
 Café-de-Valois eloquence, and suppressed fanfaronade, of this
 multitude of men with Tickets of Entry; who are now inundating
 the Corridors of the Tuileries. Such things can go on
 simultaneously in one City. How much more in one Country; in one
 Planet with its discrepancies, every Day a mere crackling
 infinitude of discrepancies—which nevertheless do yield some
 coherent net-product, though an infinitesimally small one! Be this as it may. Lafayette has saved Vincennes; and is marching
 homewards with some dozen of arrested demolitionists. Royalty is
 not yet saved;—nor indeed specially endangered. But to the King’s
 Constitutional Guard, to these old Gardes Françaises, or Centre
 Grenadiers, as it chanced to be, this affluence of men with
 Tickets of Entry is becoming more and more unintelligible. Is his
 Majesty verily for Metz, then; to be carried off by these men, on
 the spur of the instant? That revolt of Saint-Antoine got up by
 traitor Royalists for a stalking-horse? Keep a sharp outlook, ye
 Centre Grenadiers on duty here: good never came from the “men in
 black.” Nay they have cloaks, _rédingotes;_ some of them
 leather-breeches, boots,—as if for instant riding! Or what is
 this that sticks visible from the lapelle of Chevalier de
 Court?[348] Too like the handle of some cutting or stabbing
 instrument! He glides and goes; and still the dudgeon sticks from
 his left lapelle. ‘Hold, Monsieur!’—a Centre Grenadier clutches
 him; clutches the protrusive dudgeon, whisks it out in the face
 of the world: by Heaven, a very dagger; hunting-knife, or
 whatsoever you call it; fit to drink the life of Patriotism! So fared it with Chevalier de Court, early in the day; not
 without noise; not without commentaries. And now this continually
 increasing multitude at nightfall? Have they daggers too? Alas,
 with them too, after angry parleyings, there has begun a groping
 and a rummaging; all men in black, spite of their Tickets of
 Entry, are clutched by the collar, and groped. Scandalous to
 think of; for always, as the dirk, sword-cane, pistol, or were it
 but tailor’s bodkin, is found on him, and with loud scorn drawn
 forth from him, he, the hapless man in black, is flung all too
 rapidly down stairs. Flung; and ignominiously descends, head
 foremost; accelerated by ignominious shovings from sentry after
 sentry; nay, as is written, by smitings, twitchings,—spurnings,
 _à posteriori_, not to be named. In this accelerated way,
 emerges, uncertain which end uppermost, man after man in black,
 through all issues, into the Tuileries Garden. Emerges, alas,
 into the arms of an indignant multitude, now gathered and
 gathering there, in the hour of dusk, to see what is toward, and
 whether the Hereditary Representative is carried off or not.
 Hapless men in black; at last _convicted_ of poniards made to
 order; convicted “Chevaliers of the Poniard!” Within is as the
 burning ship; without is as the deep sea. Within is no help; his
 Majesty, looking forth, one moment, from his interior
 sanctuaries, coldly bids all visitors “give up their weapons;”
 and shuts the door again. The weapons given up form a heap: the
 convicted Chevaliers of the poniard keep descending pellmell,
 with impetuous velocity; and at the bottom of all staircases, the
 mixed multitude receives them, hustles, buffets, chases and
 disperses them.[349] Such sight meets Lafayette, in the dusk of the evening, as he
 returns, successful with difficulty at Vincennes: Sansculotte
 Scylla hardly weathered, here is Aristocrat Charybdis gurgling
 under his lee! The patient Hero of two Worlds almost loses
 temper. He accelerates, does not retard, the flying Chevaliers;
 delivers, indeed, this or the other hunted Loyalist of quality,
 but rates him in bitter words, such as the hour suggested; such
 as no saloon could pardon. Hero ill-bested; hanging, so to speak,
 in mid-air; hateful to Rich divinities above; hateful to Indigent
 mortals below! Duke de Villequier, Gentleman of the Chamber, gets
 such contumelious rating, in presence of all people there, that
 he may see good first to exculpate himself in the Newspapers;
 then, that not prospering, to retire over the Frontiers, and
 begin plotting at Brussels.[350] His Apartment will stand vacant;
 usefuller, as we may find, than when it stood occupied. So fly the Chevaliers of the Poniard; hunted of Patriotic men,
 shamefully in the thickening dusk. A dim miserable business; born
 of darkness; dying away there in the thickening dusk and dimness!
 In the midst of which, however, let the reader discern clearly
 one figure running for its life: Crispin-Cataline
 d’Espréménil,—for the last time, or the last but one. It is not
 yet three years since these same Centre Grenadiers, Gardes
 Françaises then, marched him towards the Calypso Isles, in the
 gray of the May morning; and he and they have got thus far.
 Buffeted, beaten down, delivered by popular Pétion, he might well
 answer bitterly: ‘And I too, Monsieur, have been carried on the
 People’s shoulders.’[351] A fact which popular Pétion, if he
 like, can meditate. But happily, one way and another, the speedy night covers up this
 ignominious Day of Poniards; and the Chevaliers escape, though
 maltreated, with torn coat-skirts and heavy hearts, to their
 respective dwelling-houses. Riot twofold is quelled; and little
 blood shed, if it be not insignificant blood from the nose:
 Vincennes stands undemolished, reparable; and the Hereditary
 Representative has not been stolen, nor the Queen smuggled into
 Prison. A Day long remembered: commented on with loud hahas and
 deep grumblings; with bitter scornfulness of triumph, bitter
 rancour of defeat. Royalism, as usual, imputes it to d’Orléans
 and the Anarchists intent on insulting Majesty: Patriotism, as
 usual, to Royalists, and even Constitutionalists, intent on
 stealing Majesty to Metz: we, also as usual, to Preternatural
 Suspicion, and Phoebus Apollo having made himself like the Night.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Thus, however, has the reader seen, in an unexpected arena, on
 this last day of February 1791, the Three long-contending
 elements of French Society, dashed forth into singular
 comico-tragical collision; acting and reacting openly to the eye.
 Constitutionalism, at once quelling Sansculottic riot at
 Vincennes, and Royalist treachery from the Tuileries, is great,
 this day, and prevails. As for poor Royalism, tossed to and fro
 in that manner, its daggers all left in a heap, what can one
 think of it? Every dog, the Adage says, has its day: _has_ it;
 has had it; or will have it. For the present, the day is
 Lafayette’s and the Constitution’s. Nevertheless Hunger and
 Jacobinism, fast growing fanatical, still work; their-day, were
 they once fanatical, will come. Hitherto, in all tempests,
 Lafayette, like some divine Sea-ruler, raises his serene head:
 the upper Æolus’s blasts fly back to their caves, like foolish
 unbidden winds: the under sea-billows they had vexed into froth
 allay themselves. But if, as we often write, the _sub_marine
 Titanic Fire-powers came into play, the Ocean bed from beneath
 being _burst?_ If they hurled Poseidon Lafayette and his
 Constitution out of Space; and, in the Titanic melee, sea were
 mixed with sky?
 Chapter 2.3.VI.
 Mirabeau. The spirit of France waxes ever more acrid, fever-sick: towards
 the final outburst of dissolution and delirium. Suspicion rules
 all minds: contending parties cannot now commingle; stand
 separated sheer asunder, eying one another, in most aguish mood,
 of cold terror or hot rage. Counter-Revolution, Days of Poniards,
 Castries Duels; Flight of Mesdames, of Monsieur and Royalty!
 Journalism shrills ever louder its cry of alarm. The sleepless
 Dionysius’s Ear of the Forty-eight Sections, how feverishly quick
 has it grown; convulsing with strange pangs the whole sick Body,
 as in such sleeplessness and sickness, the ear will do! Since Royalists get Poniards made to order, and a Sieur Motier is
 no better than he should be, shall not Patriotism too, even of
 the indigent sort, have Pikes, secondhand Firelocks, in readiness
 for the worst? The anvils ring, during this March month, with
 hammering of Pikes. A Constitutional Municipality promulgated its
 Placard, that no citizen except the “active or cash-citizen” was
 entitled to have arms; but there rose, instantly responsive, such
 a tempest of astonishment from Club and Section, that the
 Constitutional Placard, almost next morning, had to cover itself
 up, and die away into inanity, in a second improved edition.[352]
 So the hammering continues; as all that it betokens does. Mark, again, how the extreme tip of the Left is mounting in
 favour, if not in its own National Hall, yet with the Nation,
 especially with Paris. For in such universal panic of doubt, the
 opinion that is sure of itself, as the meagrest opinion may the
 soonest be, is the one to which all men will rally. Great is
 Belief, were it never so meagre; and leads captive the doubting
 heart! Incorruptible Robespierre has been elected Public Accuser
 in our new Courts of Judicature; virtuous Pétion, it is thought,
 may rise to be Mayor. Cordelier Danton, called also by triumphant
 majorities, sits at the Departmental Council-table; colleague
 there of Mirabeau. Of incorruptible Robespierre it was long ago
 predicted that he might go far, mean meagre mortal though he was;
 for Doubt dwelt not in him. Under which circumstances ought not Royalty likewise to cease
 doubting, and begin deciding and acting? Royalty has always that
 sure trump-card in its hand: Flight out of Paris. Which sure
 trump-card, Royalty, as we see, keeps ever and anon clutching at,
 grasping; and swashes it forth tentatively; yet never tables it,
 still puts it back again. Play it, O Royalty! If there be a
 chance left, this seems it, and verily the last chance; and now
 every hour is rendering this a doubtfuller. Alas, one would so
 fain both fly and not fly; play one’s card and have it to play.
 Royalty, in all human likelihood, will not play its trump-card
 till the honours, one after one, be mainly lost; and such
 trumping of it prove to be the sudden finish of the game! Here accordingly a question always arises; of the prophetic sort;
 which cannot now be answered. Suppose Mirabeau, with whom Royalty
 takes deep counsel, as with a Prime Minister that cannot yet
 legally avow himself as such, had got his arrangements
 _completed?_ Arrangements he has; far-stretching plans that dawn
 fitfully on us, by fragments, in the confused darkness. Thirty
 Departments ready to sign loyal Addresses, of prescribed tenor:
 King carried out of Paris, but only to Compiègne and Rouen,
 hardly to Metz, since, once for all, no Emigrant rabble shall
 take the lead in it: National Assembly consenting, by dint of
 loyal Addresses, by management, by force of Bouillé, to hear
 reason, and follow thither![353] Was it so, on _these_ terms,
 that Jacobinism and Mirabeau were then to grapple, in their
 Hercules-and-Typhon duel; death inevitable for the one or the
 other? The duel itself is determined on, and sure: but on what
 terms; much more, with what issue, we in vain guess. It is vague
 darkness all: unknown what is to be; unknown even what has
 already been. The giant Mirabeau walks in darkness, as we said;
 companionless, on wild ways: what his thoughts during these
 months were, no record of Biographer, not vague _Fils Adoptif_,
 will now ever disclose. To us, endeavouring to cast his horoscope, it of course remains
 doubly vague. There is one Herculean man, in internecine duel
 with him, there is Monster after Monster. Emigrant Noblesse
 return, sword on thigh, vaunting of their Loyalty never sullied;
 descending from the air, like Harpy-swarms with ferocity, with
 obscene greed. Earthward there is the Typhon of Anarchy,
 Political, Religious; sprawling hundred-headed, say with
 Twenty-five million heads; wide as the area of France; fierce as
 Frenzy; strong in very Hunger. With these shall the
 Serpent-queller do battle continually, and expect no rest. As for the King, he as usual will go wavering chameleonlike;
 changing colour and purpose with the colour of his
 environment;—good for no Kingly use. On one royal person, on the
 Queen only, can Mirabeau perhaps place dependance. It is
 possible, the greatness of this man, not unskilled too in
 blandishments, courtiership, and graceful adroitness, might, with
 most legitimate sorcery, fascinate the volatile Queen, and fix
 her to him. She has courage for all noble daring; an eye and a
 heart: the soul of Theresa’s Daughter. “_Faut il-donc_, Is it
 fated then,” she passionately writes to her Brother, “that I with
 the blood I am come of, with the sentiments I have, must live and
 die among such mortals?”[354] Alas, poor Princess, Yes. “She is
 the only _man_,” as Mirabeau observes, “whom his Majesty has
 about him.” Of one other man Mirabeau is still surer: of himself.
 There lies his resources; sufficient or insufficient. Dim and great to the eye of Prophecy looks the future! A
 perpetual life-and-death battle; confusion from above and from
 below;—mere confused darkness for us; with here and there some
 streak of faint lurid light. We see King perhaps laid aside; not
 tonsured, tonsuring is out of fashion now; but say, sent away any
 whither, with handsome annual allowance, and stock of
 smith-tools. We see a Queen and Dauphin, Regent and Minor; a
 Queen “mounted on horseback,” in the din of battles, with
 _Moriamur pro rege nostro!_ “Such a day,” Mirabeau writes, “may
 come.” Din of battles, wars more than civil, confusion from above and
 from below: in such environment the eye of Prophecy sees Comte de
 Mirabeau, like some Cardinal de Retz, stormfully maintain
 himself; with head all-devising, heart all-daring, if not
 victorious, yet unvanquished, while life is left him. The
 specialties and issues of it, no eye of Prophecy can guess at: it
 is clouds, we repeat, and tempestuous night; and in the middle of
 it, now visible, far darting, now labouring in eclipse, is
 Mirabeau indomitably struggling to be Cloud-Compeller!—One can
 say that, had Mirabeau lived, the History of France and of the
 World had been different. Further, that the man would have
 needed, as few men ever did, the whole compass of that same “Art
 of Daring, _Art d’Oser_,” which he so prized; and likewise that
 he, above all men then living, would have practised and
 manifested it. Finally, that some substantiality, and no empty
 simulacrum of a formula, would have been the result realised by
 him: a result you could have loved, a result you could have
 hated; by no likelihood, a result you could only have rejected
 with closed lips, and swept into quick forgetfulness for ever.
 Had Mirabeau lived one other year!
 Chapter 2.3.VII.
 Death of Mirabeau. But Mirabeau could not live another year, any more than he could
 live another thousand years. Men’s years are numbered, and the
 tale of Mirabeau’s was now complete. Important, or unimportant;
 to be mentioned in World-History for some centuries, or not to be
 mentioned there beyond a day or two,—it matters not to peremptory
 Fate. From amid the press of ruddy busy Life, the Pale Messenger
 beckons silently: wide-spreading interests, projects, salvation
 of French Monarchies, what thing soever man has on hand, he must
 suddenly quit it all, and go. Wert thou saving French Monarchies;
 wert thou blacking shoes on the Pont Neuf! The most important of
 men cannot stay; did the World’s History depend on an hour, that
 hour is not to be given. Whereby, indeed, it comes that these
 same _would-have-beens_ are mostly a vanity; and the World’s
 History could never in the least be what it would, or might, or
 should, by any manner of potentiality, but simply and altogether
 what it _is_. The fierce wear and tear of such an existence has wasted out the
 giant oaken strength of Mirabeau. A fret and fever that keeps
 heart and brain on fire: excess of effort, of excitement; excess
 of all kinds: labour incessant, almost beyond credibility! “If I
 had not lived with him,” says Dumont, “I should never have known
 what a man can make of one day; what things may be placed within
 the interval of twelve hours. A day for this man was more than a
 week or a month is for others: the mass of things he guided on
 together was prodigious; from the scheming to the executing not a
 moment lost.” ‘Monsieur le Comte,’ said his Secretary to him
 once, ‘what you require is impossible.’—‘Impossible!’ answered he
 starting from his chair, ‘_Ne me dites jamais ce bête de mot_,
 Never name to me that blockhead of a word.’[355] And then the
 social repasts; the dinner which he gives as Commandant of
 National Guards, which “costs five hundred pounds;” alas, and
 “the Sirens of the Opera;” and all the ginger that is hot in the
 mouth:—down what a course is this man hurled! Cannot Mirabeau
 stop; cannot he fly, and save himself alive? No! There is a
 Nessus’ Shirt on this Hercules; he must storm and burn there,
 without rest, till he be consumed. Human strength, never so
 Herculean, has its measure. Herald shadows flit pale across the
 fire-brain of Mirabeau; heralds of the pale repose. While he
 tosses and storms, straining every nerve, in that sea of ambition
 and confusion, there comes, sombre and still, a monition that for
 him the issue of it will be swift death. In January last, you might see him as President of the Assembly;
 “his neck wrapt in linen cloths, at the evening session:” there
 was sick heat of the blood, alternate darkening and flashing in
 the eye-sight; he had to apply leeches, after the morning labour,
 and preside bandaged. “At parting he embraced me,” says Dumont,
 “with an emotion I had never seen in him: ‘I am dying, my friend;
 dying as by slow fire; we shall perhaps not meet again. When I am
 gone, they will know what the value of me was. The miseries I
 have held back will burst from all sides on France.’”[356]
 Sickness gives louder warning; but cannot be listened to. On the
 27th day of March, proceeding towards the Assembly, he had to
 seek rest and help in Friend de Lamarck’s, by the road; and lay
 there, for an hour, half-fainted, stretched on a sofa. To the
 Assembly nevertheless he went, as if in spite of Destiny itself;
 spoke, loud and eager, five several times; then quitted the
 Tribune—for ever. He steps out, utterly exhausted, into the
 Tuileries Gardens; many people press round him, as usual, with
 applications, memorials; he says to the Friend who was with him:
 Take me out of this! And so, on the last day of March 1791, endless anxious multitudes
 beset the Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin; incessantly inquiring:
 within doors there, in that House numbered in our time “42,” the
 over wearied giant has fallen down, to die.[357] Crowds, of all
 parties and kinds; of all ranks from the King to the meanest man!
 The King sends publicly twice a-day to inquire; privately
 besides: from the world at large there is no end of inquiring. “A
 written bulletin is handed out every three hours,” is copied and
 circulated; in the end, it is printed. The People spontaneously
 keep silence; no carriage shall enter with its noise: there is
 crowding pressure; but the Sister of Mirabeau is reverently
 recognised, and has free way made for her. The People stand mute,
 heart-stricken; to all it seems as if a great calamity were nigh:
 as if the last man of France, who could have swayed these coming
 troubles, lay there at hand-grips with the unearthly Power. The silence of a whole People, the wakeful toil of Cabanis,
 Friend and Physician, skills not: on Saturday, the second day of
 April, Mirabeau feels that the last of the Days has risen for
 him; that, on this day, he has to depart and be no more. His
 death is Titanic, as his life has been. Lit up, for the last
 time, in the glare of coming dissolution, the mind of the man is
 all glowing and burning; utters itself in sayings, such as men
 long remember. He longs to live, yet acquiesces in death, argues
 not with the inexorable. His speech is wild and wondrous:
 unearthly Phantasms dancing now their torch-dance round his soul;
 the soul itself looking out, fire-radiant, motionless, girt
 together for that great hour! At times comes a beam of light from
 him on the world he is quitting. ‘I carry in my heart the
 death-dirge of the French Monarchy; the dead remains of it will
 now be the spoil of the factious.’ Or again, when he heard the
 cannon fire, what is characteristic too: ‘Have we the Achilles’
 Funeral already?’ So likewise, while some friend is supporting
 him: ‘Yes, support that head; would I could bequeath it thee!’
 For the man dies as he has lived; self-conscious, conscious of a
 world looking on. He gazes forth on the young Spring, which for
 him will never be Summer. The Sun has risen; he says: ‘_Si ce
 n’est pas là Dieu, c’est du moins son cousin
 germain_.’[358]—Death has mastered the outworks; power of speech
 is gone; the citadel of the heart still holding out: the moribund
 giant, passionately, by sign, demands paper and pen; writes his
 passionate demand for opium, to end these agonies. The sorrowful
 Doctor shakes his head: _Dormir_ “To sleep,” writes the other,
 passionately pointing at it! So dies a gigantic Heathen and
 Titan; stumbling blindly, undismayed, down to his rest. At
 half-past eight in the morning, Dr. Petit, standing at the foot
 of the bed, says ‘_Il ne souffre plus_.’ His suffering and his
 working are now ended. Even so, ye silent Patriot multitudes, all ye men of France; this
 man is rapt away from you. He has fallen suddenly, without
 bending till he broke; as a tower falls, smitten by sudden
 lightning. His word ye shall hear no more, his guidance follow no
 more.—The multitudes depart, heartstruck; spread the sad tidings.
 How touching is the loyalty of men to their Sovereign Man! All
 theatres, public amusements close; no joyful meeting can be held
 in these nights, joy is not for them: the People break in upon
 private dancing-parties, and sullenly command that they cease. Of
 such dancing-parties apparently but two came to light; and these
 also have gone out. The gloom is universal: never in this City
 was such sorrow for one death; never since that old night when
 Louis XII. departed, “and the _Crieurs des Corps_ went sounding
 their bells, and crying along the streets: _Le bon roi Louis,
 père du peuple, est mort_, The good King Louis, Father of the
 People, is dead!”[359] King Mirabeau is now the lost King; and
 one may say with little exaggeration, all the People mourns for
 him. For three days there is low wide moan: weeping in the National
 Assembly itself. The streets are all mournful; orators mounted on
 the _bornes_, with large silent audience, preaching the funeral
 sermon of the dead. Let no coachman whip fast, distractively with
 his rolling wheels, or almost at all, through these groups! His
 traces may be cut; himself and his fare, as incurable
 Aristocrats, hurled sulkily into the kennels. The bourne-stone
 orators speak as it is given them; the Sansculottic People, with
 its rude soul, listens eager,—as men will to any Sermon, or
 _Sermo_, when it _is_ a spoken Word meaning a Thing, and not a
 Babblement meaning No-thing. In the Restaurateur’s of the Palais
 Royal, the waiter remarks, ‘Fine weather, Monsieur:’—‘Yes, my
 friend,’ answers the ancient Man of Letters, ‘very fine; but
 Mirabeau is dead.’ Hoarse rhythmic threnodies comes also from the
 throats of balladsingers; are sold on gray-white paper at a _sou_
 each.[360] But of Portraits, engraved, painted, hewn, and
 written; of Eulogies, Reminiscences, Biographies, nay
 _Vaudevilles_, Dramas and Melodramas, in all Provinces of France,
 there will, through these coming months, be the due immeasurable
 crop; thick as the leaves of Spring. Nor, that a tincture of
 burlesque might be in it, is Gobel’s Episcopal _Mandement_
 wanting; goose Gobel, who has just been made Constitutional
 Bishop of Paris. A Mandement wherein _Ça ira_ alternates very
 strangely with _Nomine Domini_, and you are, with a grave
 countenance, invited to “rejoice at possessing in the midst of
 you a body of Prelates created by Mirabeau, zealous followers of
 his doctrine, faithful imitators of his virtues.”[361] So speaks,
 and cackles manifold, the Sorrow of France; wailing articulately,
 inarticulately, as it can, that a Sovereign Man is snatched away.
 In the National Assembly, when difficult questions are astir, all
 eyes will “turn mechanically to the place where Mirabeau
 sat,”—and Mirabeau is absent now. On the third evening of the lamentation, the fourth of April,
 there is solemn Public Funeral; such as deceased mortal seldom
 had. Procession of a league in length; of mourners reckoned
 loosely at a hundred thousand! All roofs are thronged with
 onlookers, all windows, lamp-irons, branches of trees. “Sadness
 is painted on every countenance; many persons weep.” There is
 double hedge of National Guards; there is National Assembly in a
 body; Jacobin Society, and Societies; King’s Ministers,
 Municipals, and all Notabilities, Patriot or Aristocrat. Bouillé
 is noticeable there, “with his hat on;” say, hat drawn over his
 brow, hiding many thoughts! Slow-wending, in religious silence,
 the Procession of a league in length, under the level sun-rays,
 for it is five o’clock, moves and marches: with its sable plumes;
 itself in a religious silence; but, by fits, with the muffled
 roll of drums, by fits with some long-drawn wail of music, and
 strange new clangour of trombones, and metallic dirge-voice; amid
 the infinite hum of men. In the Church of Saint-Eustache, there
 is funeral oration by Cerutti; and discharge of fire-arms, which
 “brings down pieces of the plaster.” Thence, forward again to the
 Church of Sainte-Genevieve; which has been consecrated, by
 supreme decree, on the spur of this time, into a Pantheon for the
 Great Men of the Fatherland, _Aux Grands Hommes la Patrie
 réconnaissante_. Hardly at midnight is the business done; and
 Mirabeau left in his dark dwelling: first tenant of that
 Fatherland’s Pantheon. Tenant, alas, who inhabits but at will, and shall be cast out!
 For, in these days of convulsion and disjection, not even the
 dust of the dead is permitted to rest. Voltaire’s bones are, by
 and by, to be carried from their stolen grave in the Abbéy of
 Scellières, to an eager _stealing_ grave, in Paris his
 birth-city: all mortals processioning and perorating there; cars
 drawn by eight white horses, goadsters in classical costume, with
 fillets and wheat-ears enough;—though the weather is of the
 wettest.[362] Evangelist Jean Jacques, too, as is most proper,
 must be dug up from Ermenonville, and processioned, with pomp,
 with sensibility, to the Pantheon of the Fatherland.[363] He and
 others: while again Mirabeau, we say, is cast forth from it,
 happily incapable of being replaced; and rests now,
 irrecognisable, reburied hastily at dead of night, in the central
 “part of the Churchyard Sainte-Catherine, in the Suburb
 Saint-Marceau,” to be disturbed no further. So blazes out, farseen, a Man’s Life, and becomes ashes and a
 _caput mortuum_, in this World-Pyre, which we name French
 Revolution: not the first that consumed itself there; nor, by
 thousands and many millions, the last! A man who “had swallowed
 all formulas;” who, in these strange times and circumstances,
 felt called to live Titanically, and also to die so. As he, for
 his part had swallowed all formulas, what Formula is there, never
 so comprehensive, that will express truly the _plus_ and the
 _minus_, give us the accurate net-result of him? There is
 hitherto none such. Moralities not a few must shriek condemnatory
 over this Mirabeau; the Morality by which he could be judged has
 not yet got uttered in the speech of men. We shall say this of
 him, again: That he is a Reality, and no Simulacrum: a living son
 of Nature our general Mother; not a hollow Artfice, and mechanism
 of Conventionalities, son of nothing, _brother_ to nothing. In
 which little word, let the earnest man, walking sorrowful in a
 world mostly of “Stuffed Clothes-suits,” that chatter and grin
 meaningless on him, quite _ghastly_ to the earnest soul,—think
 what significance there is! Of men who, in such sense, are alive, and see with eyes, the
 number is now not great: it may be well, if in this huge French
 Revolution itself, with its all-developing fury, we find some
 Three. Mortals driven rabid we find; sputtering the acridest
 logic; baring their breast to the battle-hail, their neck to the
 guillotine; of whom it is so painful to say that they too are
 still, in good part, manufactured Formalities, not Facts but
 Hearsays! Honour to the strong man, in these ages, who has shaken himself
 loose of shams, and is something. For in the way of being
 _worthy_, the first condition surely is that one _be_. Let Cant
 cease, at all risks and at all costs: till Cant cease, nothing
 else can begin. Of human Criminals, in these centuries, writes
 the Moralist, I find but one unforgivable: the Quack. “Hateful to
 God,” as divine Dante sings, “and to the Enemies of God, ‘A Dio spiacente ed a’ nemici sui!’
 But whoever will, with sympathy, which is the first essential
 towards insight, look at this questionable Mirabeau, may find
 that there lay verily in him, as the basis of all, a Sincerity, a
 great free Earnestness; nay call it Honesty, for the man did
 before all things see, with that clear flashing vision, into what
 was, into what existed as fact; and did, with his wild heart,
 follow that and no other. Whereby on what ways soever he travels
 and struggles, often enough falling, he is still a brother man.
 Hate him not; thou canst not hate him! Shining through such soil
 and tarnish, and now victorious effulgent, and oftenest
 struggling eclipsed, the light of genius itself is in this man;
 which was never yet base and hateful: but at worst was
 lamentable, loveable with pity. They say that he was ambitious,
 that he wanted to be Minister. It is most true; and was he not
 simply the one man in France who could have done any good as
 Minister? Not vanity alone, not pride alone; far from that! Wild
 burstings of affection were in this great heart; of fierce
 lightning, and soft dew of pity. So sunk, bemired in wretchedest
 defacements, it may be said of him, like the Magdalen of old,
 that he loved much: his Father the harshest of old crabbed men he
 loved with warmth, with veneration. Be it that his falls and follies are manifold,—as himself often
 lamented even with tears.[364] Alas, is not the Life of every
 such man already a poetic Tragedy; made up “of Fate and of one’s
 own Deservings,” of _Schicksal und eigene Schuld;_ full of the
 elements of Pity and Fear? This brother man, if not Epic for us,
 is Tragic; if not great, is large; large in his qualities,
 world-large in his destinies. Whom other men, recognising him as
 such, may, through long times, remember, and draw nigh to examine
 and consider: these, in their several dialects, will say of him
 and sing of him,—till the right thing be said; and so the Formula
 that _can_ judge him be no longer an undiscovered one. Here then the wild Gabriel Honoré drops from the tissue of our
 History; not without a tragic farewell. He is gone: the flower of
 the wild Riquetti or Arrighetti kindred; which seems as if in
 him, with one last effort, it had done its best, and then
 expired, or sunk down to the undistinguished level. Crabbed old
 Marquis Mirabeau, the Friend of Men, sleeps sound. The Bailli
 Mirabeau, worthy uncle, will soon die forlorn, alone.
 Barrel-Mirabeau, already gone across the Rhine, his Regiment of
 Emigrants will drive nigh desperate. “Barrel-Mirabeau,” says a
 biographer of his, “went indignantly across the Rhine, and
 drilled Emigrant Regiments. But as he sat one morning in his
 tent, sour of stomach doubtless and of heart, meditating in
 Tartarean humour on the turn things took, a certain Captain or
 Subaltern demanded admittance on business. Such Captain is
 refused; he again demands, with refusal; and then again, till
 Colonel Viscount Barrel-Mirabeau, blazing up into a mere burning
 brandy barrel, clutches his sword, and tumbles out on this
 _canaille_ of an intruder,—alas, on the _canaille_ of an
 intruder’s sword’s point, who had drawn with swift dexterity; and
 dies, and the Newspapers name it _apoplexy_ and _alarming
 accident_.” So die the Mirabeaus. New Mirabeaus one hears not of: the wild kindred, as we said, is
 gone out with this its greatest. As families and kindreds
 sometimes do; producing, after long ages of unnoted notability,
 some living quintescence of all the qualities they had, to flame
 forth as a man world-noted; after whom they rest as if exhausted;
 the sceptre passing to others. The chosen Last of the Mirabeaus
 is gone; the chosen man of France is gone. It was he who shook
 old France from its basis; and, as if with his single hand, has
 held it toppling there, still unfallen. What things depended on
 that one man! He is as a ship suddenly shivered on sunk rocks:
 much swims on the waste waters, far from help.

 Chapter 2.4.I.
 Easter at Saint-Cloud. The French Monarchy may now therefore be considered as, in all
 human probability, lost; as struggling henceforth in blindness as
 well as weakness, the last light of reasonable guidance having
 gone out. What remains of resources their poor Majesties will
 waste still further, in uncertain loitering and wavering.
 Mirabeau himself had to complain that they only gave him half
 confidence, and always had some plan within his plan. Had they
 fled frankly with him, to Rouen or anywhither, long ago! They may
 fly now with chance immeasurably lessened; which will go on
 lessening towards absolute zero. Decide, O Queen; poor Louis can
 decide nothing: execute this Flight-project, or at least abandon
 it. Correspondence with Bouillé there has been enough; what
 profits consulting, and hypothesis, while all around is in fierce
 activity of practice? The Rustic sits waiting till the river run
 dry: alas with you it is not a common river, but a Nile
 Inundation; snow melting in the unseen mountains; till all, and
 you where you sit, be submerged. Many things invite to flight. The voice Journals invites;
 Royalist Journals proudly hinting it as a threat, Patriot
 Journals rabidly denouncing it as a terror. Mother Society,
 waxing more and more emphatic, invites;—so emphatic that, as was
 prophesied, Lafayette and your limited Patriots have ere long to
 branch off from her, and form themselves into Feuillans; with
 infinite public controversy; the victory in which, doubtful
 though it look, will remain with the _un_limited Mother.
 Moreover, ever since the Day of Poniards, we have seen unlimited
 Patriotism openly equipping itself with arms. Citizens denied
 “activity,” which is facetiously made to signify a certain weight
 of purse, cannot buy blue uniforms, and be Guardsmen; but man is
 greater than blue cloth; man can fight, if need be, in multiform
 cloth, or even almost without cloth—as Sansculotte. So Pikes
 continued to be hammered, whether those Dirks of improved
 structure with barbs be “meant for the West-India market,” or not
 meant. Men beat, the wrong way, their ploughshares into swords.
 Is there not what we may call an “Austrian Committee,” _Comité
 Autrichein_, sitting daily and nightly in the Tuileries?
 Patriotism, by vision and suspicion, knows it too well! If the
 King fly, will there not be Aristocrat-Austrian Invasion;
 butchery, replacement of Feudalism; wars more than civil? The
 hearts of men are saddened and maddened.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Dissident Priests likewise give trouble enough. Expelled from
 their Parish Churches, where Constitutional Priests, elected by
 the Public, have replaced them, these unhappy persons resort to
 Convents of Nuns, or other such receptacles; and there, on
 Sabbath, collecting assemblages of Anti-Constitutional
 individuals, who have grown devout all on a sudden,[365] they
 worship or pretend to worship in their strait-laced contumacious
 manner; to the scandal of Patriotism. Dissident Priests, passing
 along with their sacred wafer for the dying, seem wishful to be
 massacred in the streets; wherein Patriotism will not gratify
 them. Slighter palm of martyrdom, however, shall not be denied:
 martyrdom not of massacre, yet of fustigation. At the refractory
 places of worship, Patriot men appear; Patriot women with strong
 hazel wands, which they apply. Shut thy eyes, O Reader; see not
 this misery, peculiar to these later times,—of martyrdom without
 sincerity, with only cant and contumacy! A dead Catholic Church
 is not allowed to lie dead; no, it is _galvanised_ into the
 detestablest death-life; whereat Humanity, we say, shuts its
 eyes. For the Patriot women take their hazel wands, and
 fustigate, amid laughter of bystanders, with alacrity: broad
 bottom of Priests; alas, Nuns too reversed, and _cotillons
 retroussés!_ The National Guard does what it can: Municipality
 “invokes the Principles of Toleration;” grants Dissident
 worshippers the Church of the _Théatins;_ promising protection.
 But it is to no purpose: at the door of that _Théatins;_ Church,
 appears a Placard, and suspended atop, like Plebeian Consular
 _fasces_,—a Bundle of Rods! The Principles of Toleration must do
 the best they may: but no Dissident man shall worship
 contumaciously; there is a _Plebiscitum_ to that effect; which,
 though unspoken, is like the laws of the Medes and Persians.
 Dissident contumacious Priests ought not to be harboured, even in
 private, by any man: the Club of the Cordeliers openly denounces
 Majesty himself as doing it.[366] Many things invite to flight: but probably this thing above all
 others, that it has become impossible! On the 15th of April,
 notice is given that his Majesty, who has suffered much from
 catarrh lately, will enjoy the Spring weather, for a few days, at
 Saint-Cloud. Out at Saint-Cloud? Wishing to celebrate his Easter,
 his _Pâques_, or Pasch, there; with refractory
 Anti-Constitutional Dissidents?—Wishing rather to make off for
 Compiègne, and thence to the Frontiers? As were, in good sooth,
 perhaps feasible, or would once have been; nothing but some two
 _chasseurs_ attending you; chasseurs easily corrupted! It is a
 pleasant possibility, execute it or not. Men say there are thirty
 thousand Chevaliers of the Poniard lurking in the woods there:
 lurking in the woods, and thirty thousand,—for the human
 Imagination is not fettered. But now, how easily might these,
 dashing out on Lafayette, snatch off the Hereditary
 Representative; and roll away with him, after the manner of a
 whirlblast, whither they listed!—Enough, it were well the King
 did not go. Lafayette is forewarned and forearmed: but, indeed,
 is the risk his only; or his and all France’s? Monday the eighteenth of April is come; the Easter Journey to
 Saint-Cloud shall take effect. National Guard has got its orders;
 a First Division, as Advanced Guard, has even marched, and
 probably arrived. His Majesty’s _Maison-bouche_, they say, is all
 busy stewing and frying at Saint-Cloud; the King’s Dinner not far
 from ready there. About one o’clock, the Royal Carriage, with its
 eight royal blacks, shoots stately into the Place du Carrousel;
 draws up to receive its royal burden. But hark! From the
 neighbouring Church of Saint-Roch, the tocsin begins
 ding-donging. Is the King stolen then; he is going; gone?
 Multitudes of persons crowd the Carrousel: the Royal Carriage
 still stands there;—and, by Heaven’s strength, shall stand! Lafayette comes up, with aide-de-camps and oratory; pervading the
 groups: ‘_Taisez vous_,’ answer the groups, ‘the King shall not
 go.’ Monsieur appears, at an upper window: ten thousand voices
 bray and shriek, ‘_Nous ne voulons pas que le Roi parte_.’ Their
 Majesties have mounted. Crack go the whips; but twenty Patriot
 arms have seized each of the eight bridles: there is rearing,
 rocking, vociferation; not the smallest headway. In vain does
 Lafayette fret, indignant; and perorate and strive: Patriots in
 the passion of terror, bellow round the Royal Carriage; it is one
 bellowing sea of Patriot terror run frantic. Will Royalty fly off
 towards Austria; like a lit rocket, towards endless Conflagration
 of Civil War? Stop it, ye Patriots, in the name of Heaven! Rude
 voices passionately apostrophise Royalty itself. Usher Campan,
 and other the like official persons, pressing forward with help
 or advice, are clutched by the sashes, and hurled and whirled, in
 a confused perilous manner; so that her Majesty has to plead
 passionately from the carriage-window. Order cannot be heard, cannot be followed; National Guards know
 not how to act. Centre Grenadiers, of the Observatoire Battalion,
 are there; not on duty; alas, in quasi-mutiny; speaking rude
 disobedient words; threatening the mounted Guards with sharp shot
 if they hurt the people. Lafayette mounts and dismounts; runs
 haranguing, panting; on the verge of despair. For an hour and
 three-quarters; “seven quarters of an hour,” by the Tuileries
 Clock! Desperate Lafayette will open a passage, were it by the
 cannon’s mouth, if his Majesty will order. Their Majesties,
 counselled to it by Royalist friends, by Patriot foes, dismount;
 and retire in, with heavy indignant heart; giving up the
 enterprise. _Maison-bouche_ may eat that cooked dinner
 themselves; his Majesty shall not see Saint-Cloud this day,—or
 any day.[367] The pathetic fable of imprisonment in one’s own Palace has become
 a sad fact, then? Majesty complains to Assembly; Municipality
 deliberates, proposes to petition or address; Sections respond
 with sullen brevity of negation. Lafayette flings down his
 Commission; appears in civic pepper-and-salt frock; and cannot be
 flattered back again;—not in less than three days; and by
 unheard-of entreaty; National Guards kneeling to him, and
 declaring that it is not sycophancy, that they are free men
 kneeling here to the _Statue of Liberty_. For the rest, those
 Centre Grenadiers of the Observatoire are disbanded,—yet indeed
 are reinlisted, all but fourteen, under a new name, and with new
 quarters. The King must keep his Easter in Paris: meditating much
 on this singular posture of things: but as good as determined now
 to fly from it, desire being whetted by difficulty.
 Chapter 2.4.II.
 Easter at Paris. For above a year, ever since March 1790, it would seem, there has
 hovered a project of Flight before the royal mind; and ever and
 anon has been condensing itself into something like a purpose;
 but this or the other difficulty always vaporised it again. It
 seems so full of risks, perhaps of civil war itself; above all,
 it cannot be done without effort. Somnolent laziness will not
 serve: to fly, if not in a leather _vache_, one must verily stir
 himself. Better to adopt that Constitution of theirs; execute it
 so as to shew all men that it is inexecutable? Better or not so
 good; surely it is _easier_. To all difficulties you need only
 say, There is a lion in the path, behold your Constitution will
 not act! For a somnolent person it requires no effort to
 counterfeit death,—as Dame de Staël and Friends of Liberty can
 see the King’s Government long doing, _faisant le mort_. Nay now, when desire whetted by difficulty has brought the matter
 to a head, and the royal mind no longer halts between two, what
 can come of it? Grant that poor Louis were safe with Bouillé,
 what on the whole could he look for there? Exasperated Tickets of
 Entry answer, Much, all. But cold Reason answers, Little almost
 nothing. Is not loyalty a law of Nature? ask the Tickets of
 Entry. Is not love of your King, and even death for him, the
 glory of all Frenchmen,—except these few Democrats? Let Democrat
 Constitution-builders see what they will do without their
 Keystone; and France rend its hair, having lost the Hereditary
 Representative! Thus will King Louis fly; one sees not reasonably towards what.
 As a maltreated Boy, shall we say, who, having a Stepmother,
 rushes sulky into the wide world; and will wring the paternal
 heart?—Poor Louis escapes from known unsupportable evils, to an
 unknown mixture of good and evil, coloured by Hope. He goes, as
 Rabelais did when dying, to seek a great May-be: _je vais
 chercher un grand Peut-être!_ As not only the sulky Boy but the
 wise grown Man is obliged to do, so often, in emergencies. For the rest, there is still no lack of stimulants, and stepdame
 maltreatments, to keep one’s resolution at the due pitch.
 Factious disturbance ceases not: as indeed how can they, unless
 authoritatively _conjured_, in a Revolt which is by nature
 bottomless? If the ceasing of faction be the price of the King’s
 somnolence, he may awake when he will, and take wing. Remark, in any case, what somersets and contortions a dead
 Catholicism is making,—skilfully galvanised: hideous, and even
 piteous, to behold! Jurant and Dissident, with their shaved
 crowns, argue frothing everywhere; or are ceasing to argue, and
 stripping for battle. In Paris was scourging while need
 continued: contrariwise, in the Morbihan of Brittany, without
 scourging, armed Peasants are up, roused by pulpit-drum, they
 know not why. General Dumouriez, who has got missioned
 thitherward, finds all in sour heat of darkness; finds also that
 explanation and conciliation will still do much.[368] But again, consider this: that his Holiness, Pius Sixth, has seen
 good to excommunicate Bishop Talleyrand! Surely, we will say
 then, considering it, there is no living or dead Church in the
 Earth that has not the indubitablest right to excommunicate
 Talleyrand. Pope Pius has right and might, in his way. But truly
 so likewise has Father Adam, _ci-devant_ Marquis Saint-Huruge, in
 his way. Behold, therefore, on the Fourth of May, in the
 Palais-Royal, a mixed loud-sounding multitude; in the middle of
 whom, Father Adam, bull-voiced Saint-Huruge, in white hat, towers
 visible and audible. With him, it is said, walks Journalist
 Gorsas, walk many others of the washed sort; for no authority
 will interfere. Pius Sixth, with his plush and tiara, and power
 of the Keys, they bear aloft: of natural size,—made of lath and
 combustible gum. Royou, the King’s Friend, is borne too in
 effigy; with a pile of Newspaper _King’s-Friends_, condemned
 numbers of the _Ami-du-Roi;_ fit fuel of the sacrifice. Speeches
 are spoken; a judgment is held, a doom proclaimed, audible in
 bull-voice, towards the four winds. And thus, amid great
 shouting, the holocaust is consummated, under the summer sky; and
 our lath-and-gum Holiness, with the attendant victims, mounts up
 in flame, and sinks down in ashes; a decomposed Pope: and right
 or might, among all the parties, has better or worse accomplished
 itself, as it could.[369] But, on the whole, reckoning from
 Martin Luther in the Marketplace of Wittenberg to Marquis
 Saint-Huruge in this Palais-Royal of Paris, what a journey have
 we gone; into what strange territories has it carried us! No
 Authority can now interfere. Nay Religion herself, mourning for
 such things, may after all ask, What have _I_ to do with them? In such extraordinary manner does dead Catholicism somerset and
 caper, skilfully galvanised. For, does the reader inquire into
 the subject-matter of controversy in this case; what the
 difference between Orthodoxy or _My-doxy_ and Heterodoxy or
 _Thy-doxy_ might here be? My-doxy is that an august National
 Assembly can equalize the extent of Bishopricks; that an
 equalized Bishop, his Creed and Formularies being left quite as
 they were, can swear Fidelity to King, Law and Nation, and so
 become a Constitutional Bishop. Thy-doxy, if thou be Dissident,
 is that he cannot; but that he must become an accursed thing.
 Human ill-nature needs but some Homoiousian _iota_, or even the
 pretence of one; and will flow copiously through the eye of a
 needle: thus always must mortals go jargoning and fuming,     And, like the ancient Stoics in their porches
     With fierce dispute maintain their churches.
 This _Auto-da-fé_ of Saint-Huruge’s was on the Fourth of May,
 1791. Royalty sees it; but says nothing.
 Chapter 2.4.III.
 Count Fersen. Royalty, in fact, should, by this time, be far on with its
 preparations. Unhappily much preparation is needful: could a
 Hereditary Representative be carried in leather _vache_, how easy
 were it! But it is not so. New clothes are needed, as usual, in all Epic transactions, were
 it in the grimmest iron ages; consider “Queen Chrimhilde, with
 her sixty semstresses,” in that iron _Nibelungen Song!_ No Queen
 can stir without new clothes. Therefore, now, Dame Campan whisks
 assiduous to this mantua-maker and to that: and there is clipping
 of frocks and gowns, upper clothes and under, great and small;
 such a clipping and sewing, as might have been dispensed with.
 Moreover, her Majesty cannot go a step anywhither without her
 _Nécessaire;_ dear _Nécessaire_, of inlaid ivory and rosewood;
 cunningly devised; which holds perfumes, toilet-implements,
 infinite small queenlike furnitures: Necessary to terrestrial
 life. Not without a cost of some five hundred louis, of much
 precious time, and difficult hoodwinking which does not blind,
 can this same Necessary of life be forwarded by the Flanders
 Carriers,—never to get to hand.[370] All which, you would say,
 augurs ill for the prospering of the enterprise. But the whims of
 women and queens must be humoured. Bouillé, on his side, is making a fortified Camp at Montmédi;
 gathering Royal-Allemand, and all manner of other German and true
 French Troops thither, “to watch the Austrians.” His Majesty will
 not cross the Frontiers, unless on compulsion. Neither shall the
 Emigrants be much employed, hateful as they are to all
 people.[371] Nor shall old war-god Broglie have any hand in the
 business; but solely our brave Bouillé; to whom, on the day of
 meeting, a Marshal’s Baton shall be delivered, by a rescued King,
 amid the shouting of all the troops. In the meanwhile, Paris
 being so suspicious, were it not perhaps good to write your
 Foreign Ambassadors an ostensible Constitutional Letter; desiring
 all Kings and men to take heed that King Louis loves the
 Constitution, that he has voluntarily sworn, and does again
 swear, to maintain the same, and will reckon those his enemies
 who affect to say otherwise? Such a Constitutional circular is
 despatched by Couriers, is communicated confidentially to the
 Assembly, and printed in all Newspapers; with the finest
 effect.[372] Simulation and dissimulation mingle extensively in
 human affairs. We observe, however, that Count Fersen is often using his Ticket
 of Entry; which surely he has clear right to do. A gallant
 Soldier and Swede, devoted to this fair Queen;—as indeed the
 Highest Swede now is. Has not King Gustav, famed fiery _Chevalier
 du Nord_, sworn himself, by the old laws of chivalry, her Knight?
 He will descend on fire-wings, of Swedish musketry, and deliver
 her from these foul dragons,—if, alas, the assassin’s pistol
 intervene not! But, in fact, Count Fersen does seem a likely young soldier, of
 alert decisive ways: he circulates widely, seen, unseen; and has
 business on hand. Also Colonel the Duke de Choiseul, nephew of
 Choiseul the great, of Choiseul the now deceased; he and Engineer
 Goguelat are passing and repassing between Metz and the
 Tuileries; and Letters go in cipher,—one of them, a most
 important one, hard to _de_cipher; Fersen having ciphered it in
 haste.[373] As for Duke de Villequier, he is gone ever since the
 Day of Poniards; but his Apartment is useful for her Majesty. On the other side, poor Commandment Gouvion, watching at the
 Tuileries, second in National Command, sees several things hard
 to interpret. It is the same Gouvion who sat, long months ago, at
 the Townhall, gazing helpless into that Insurrection of Women;
 motionless, as the brave stabled steed when conflagration rises,
 till Usher Maillard snatched his drum. Sincerer Patriot there is
 not; but many a shiftier. He, if Dame Campan gossip credibly, is
 paying some similitude of love-court to a certain false
 Chambermaid of the Palace, who betrays much to him: the
 _Nécessaire_, the clothes, the packing of the jewels,[374]—could
 he understand it when betrayed. Helpless Gouvion gazes with
 sincere glassy eyes into it; stirs up his sentries to vigilence;
 walks restless to and fro; and hopes the best. But, on the whole, one finds that, in the second week of June,
 Colonel de Choiseul is privately in Paris; having come “to see
 his children.” Also that Fersen has got a stupendous new Coach
 built, of the kind named _Berline;_ done by the first artists;
 according to a model: they bring it home to him, in Choiseul’s
 presence; the two friends take a proof-drive in it, along the
 streets; in meditative mood; then send it up to “Madame
 Sullivan’s, in the Rue de Clichy,” far North, to wait there till
 wanted. Apparently a certain Russian Baroness de Korff, with
 Waiting-woman, Valet, and two Children, will travel homewards
 with some state: in whom these young military gentlemen take
 interest? A Passport has been procured for her; and much
 assistance shewn, with Coach-builders and such like;—so helpful
 polite are young military men. Fersen has likewise purchased a
 Chaise fit for two, at least for two waiting-maids; further,
 certain necessary horses: one would say, he is himself quitting
 France, not without outlay? We observe finally that their
 Majesties, Heaven willing, will assist at _Corpus-Christi Day_,
 this blessed Summer Solstice, in Assumption Church, here at
 Paris, to the joy of all the world. For which same day, moreover,
 brave Bouillé, at Metz, as we find, has invited a party of
 friends to dinner; but indeed is gone from home, in the interim,
 over to Montmédi. These are of the Phenomena, or visual Appearances, of this
 wide-working terrestrial world: which truly is all phenomenal,
 what they call spectral; and never rests at any moment; one never
 at any moment can know why. On Monday night, the Twentieth of June 1791, about eleven
 o’clock, there is many a hackney-coach, and glass-coach
 (_carrosse de remise_), still rumbling, or at rest, on the
 streets of Paris. But of all Glass-coaches, we recommend this to
 thee, O Reader, which stands drawn up, in the Rue de l’Echelle,
 hard by the Carrousel and outgate of the Tuileries; in the Rue de
 l’Echelle that then was; “opposite Ronsin the saddler’s door,” as
 if waiting for a fare there! Not long does it wait: a hooded
 Dame, with two hooded Children has issued from Villequier’s door,
 where no sentry walks, into the Tuileries Court-of-Princes; into
 the Carrousel; into the Rue de l’Echelle; where the
 Glass-coachman readily admits them; and again waits. Not long;
 another Dame, likewise hooded or shrouded, leaning on a servant,
 issues in the same manner, by the Glass-coachman, cheerfully
 admitted. Whither go, so many Dames? ’Tis His Majesty’s
 _Couchée_, Majesty just gone to bed, and all the Palace-world is
 retiring home. But the Glass-coachman still waits; his fare
 seemingly incomplete. By and by, we note a thickset Individual, in round hat and
 peruke, arm-and-arm with some servant, seemingly of the Runner or
 Courier sort; he also issues through Villequier’s door; starts a
 shoebuckle as he passes one of the sentries, stoops down to clasp
 it again; is however, by the Glass-coachman, still more
 cheerfully admitted. And _now_, is his fare complete? Not yet;
 the Glass-coachman still waits.—Alas! and the false Chambermaid
 has warned Gouvion that she thinks the Royal Family will fly this
 very night; and Gouvion distrusting his own glazed eyes, has sent
 express for Lafayette; and Lafayette’s Carriage, flaring with
 lights, rolls this moment through the inner Arch of the
 Carrousel,—where a Lady shaded in broad gypsy-hat, and leaning on
 the arm of a servant, also of the Runner or Courier sort, stands
 aside to let it pass, and has even the whim to touch a spoke of
 it with her _badine_,—light little magic rod which she calls
 _badine_, such as the Beautiful then wore. The flare of
 Lafayette’s Carriage, rolls past: all is found quiet in the
 Court-of-Princes; sentries at their post; Majesties’ Apartments
 closed in smooth rest. Your false Chambermaid must have been
 mistaken? Watch thou, Gouvion, with Argus’ vigilance; for, of a
 truth, treachery is within these walls. But where is the Lady that stood aside in gypsy hat, and touched
 the wheel-spoke with her _badine?_ O Reader, that Lady that
 touched the wheel-spoke was the Queen of France! She has issued
 safe through that inner Arch, into the Carrousel itself; but not
 into the Rue de l’Echelle. Flurried by the rattle and rencounter,
 she took the right hand not the left; neither she nor her Courier
 knows Paris; he indeed is no Courier, but a loyal stupid
 _ci-devant_ Bodyguard disguised as one. They are off, quite
 wrong, over the Pont Royal and River; roaming disconsolate in the
 Rue du Bac; far from the Glass-coachman, who still waits. Waits,
 with flutter of heart; with thoughts—which he must button close
 up, under his jarvie surtout! Midnight clangs from all the City-steeples; one precious hour has
 been spent so; most mortals are asleep. The Glass-coachman waits;
 and what mood! A brother jarvie drives up, enters into
 conversation; is answered cheerfully in jarvie dialect: the
 brothers of the whip exchange a pinch of snuff;[375] decline
 drinking together; and part with good night. Be the Heavens
 blest! here at length is the Queen-lady, in gypsy-hat; safe after
 perils; who has had to inquire her way. She too is admitted; her
 Courier jumps aloft, as the other, who is also a disguised
 Bodyguard, has done: and now, O Glass-coachman of a
 thousand,—Count Fersen, for the Reader sees it is thou,—drive! Dust shall not stick to the hoofs of Fersen: crack! crack! the
 Glass-coach rattles, and every soul breathes lighter. But is
 Fersen on the right road? Northeastward, to the Barrier of
 Saint-Martin and Metz Highway, thither were we bound: and lo, he
 drives right Northward! The royal Individual, in round hat and
 peruke, sits astonished; but right or wrong, there is no remedy.
 Crack, crack, we go incessant, through the slumbering City.
 Seldom, since Paris rose out of mud, or the Longhaired Kings went
 in Bullock-carts, was there such a drive. Mortals on each hand of
 you, close by, stretched out horizontal, dormant; and we alive
 and quaking! Crack, crack, through the Rue de Grammont; across
 the Boulevard; up the Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin,—these windows,
 all silent, of Number 42, were Mirabeau’s. Towards the Barrier
 not of Saint-Martin, but of Clichy on the utmost North! Patience,
 ye royal Individuals; Fersen understands what he is about.
 Passing up the Rue de Clichy, he alights for one moment at Madame
 Sullivan’s: ‘Did Count Fersen’s Coachman get the Baroness de
 Korff’s new Berline?’—‘Gone with it an hour-and-half ago,’
 grumbles responsive the drowsy Porter.—‘_C’est bien_.’ Yes, it is
 well;—though had not such hour-and half been _lost_, it were
 still better. Forth therefore, O Fersen, fast, by the Barrier de
 Clichy; then Eastward along the Outward Boulevard, what horses
 and whipcord can do! Thus Fersen drives, through the ambrosial night. Sleeping Paris
 is now all on the right hand of him; silent except for some
 snoring hum; and now he is Eastward as far as the Barrier de
 Saint-Martin; looking earnestly for Baroness de Korff’s Berline.
 This Heaven’s Berline he at length does descry, drawn up with its
 six horses, his own German Coachman waiting on the box. Right,
 thou good German: now haste, whither thou knowest!—And as for us
 of the Glass-coach, haste too, O haste; much time is already
 lost! The august Glass-coach fare, six Insides, hastily packs
 itself into the new Berline; two Bodyguard Couriers behind. The
 Glass-coach itself is turned adrift, its head towards the City;
 to wander whither it lists,—and be found next morning tumbled in
 a ditch. But Fersen is on the new box, with its brave new
 hammer-cloths; flourishing his whip; he bolts forward towards
 Bondy. There a third and final Bodyguard Courier of ours ought
 surely to be, with post-horses ready-ordered. There likewise
 ought that purchased Chaise, with the two Waiting-maids and their
 bandboxes to be; whom also her Majesty could not travel without.
 Swift, thou deft Fersen, and may the Heavens turn it well! Once more, by Heaven’s blessing, it is all well. Here is the
 sleeping Hamlet of Bondy; Chaise with Waiting-women; horses all
 ready, and postillions with their churn-boots, impatient in the
 dewy dawn. Brief harnessing done, the postillions with their
 churn-boots vault into the saddles; brandish circularly their
 little noisy whips. Fersen, under his jarvie-surtout, bends in
 lowly silent reverence of adieu; royal hands wave speechless in
 expressible response; Baroness de Korff’s Berline, with the
 Royalty of France, bounds off: for ever, as it proved. Deft
 Fersen dashes obliquely Northward, through the country, towards
 Bougret; gains Bougret, finds his German Coachman and chariot
 waiting there; cracks off, and drives undiscovered into unknown
 space. A deft active man, we say; what he undertook to do is
 nimbly and successfully done. And so the Royalty of France is actually fled? This precious
 night, the shortest of the year, it flies and drives! _Baroness
 de Korff_ is, at bottom, Dame de Tourzel, Governess of the Royal
 Children: she who came hooded with the two hooded little ones;
 little Dauphin; little Madame Royale, known long afterwards as
 Duchess d’Angouleme. Baroness de Korff’s _Waiting-maid_ is the
 Queen in gypsy-hat. The royal Individual in round hat and peruke,
 he is _Valet_, for the time being. That other hooded Dame, styled
 _Travelling-companion_, is kind Sister Elizabeth; she had sworn,
 long since, when the Insurrection of Women was, that only death
 should part her and them. And so they rush there, not too
 impetuously, through the Wood of Bondy:—over a Rubicon in their
 own and France’s History. Great; though the future is all vague! If we reach Bouillé? If we
 do not reach him? O Louis! and this all round thee is the great
 slumbering Earth (and overhead, the great watchful Heaven); the
 slumbering Wood of Bondy,—where Longhaired Childeric Donothing
 was struck through with iron;[376] not unreasonably. These peaked
 stone-towers are Raincy; towers of wicked d’Orléans. All slumbers
 save the multiplex rustle of our new Berline. Loose-skirted
 scarecrow of an Herb-merchant, with his ass and early greens,
 toilsomely plodding, seems the only creature we meet. But right
 ahead the great North-East sends up evermore his gray brindled
 dawn: from dewy branch, birds here and there, with short deep
 warble, salute the coming Sun. Stars fade out, and Galaxies;
 Street-lamps of the City of God. The Universe, O my brothers, is
 flinging wide its portals for the Levee of the GREAT HIGH KING.
 Thou, poor King Louis, farest nevertheless, as mortals do,
 towards Orient lands of Hope; and the Tuileries with _its_
 Levees, and France and the Earth itself, is but a larger kind of
 doghutch,—occasionally going rabid.
 Chapter 2.4.IV.
 Attitude. But in Paris, at six in the morning; when some Patriot Deputy,
 warned by a billet, awoke Lafayette, and they went to the
 Tuileries?—Imagination may paint, but words cannot, the surprise
 of Lafayette; or with what bewilderment helpless Gouvion rolled
 glassy Argus’s eyes, discerning now that his false Chambermaid
 told true! However, it is to be recorded that Paris, thanks to an august
 National Assembly, did, on this seeming doomsday, surpass itself.
 Never, according to Historian eye-witnesses, was there seen such
 an “imposing attitude.”[377] Sections all “in permanence;” our
 Townhall, too, having first, about ten o’clock, fired three
 solemn alarm-cannons: above all, our National Assembly! National
 Assembly, likewise permanent, decides what is needful; with
 unanimous consent, for the _Côté Droit_ sits dumb, afraid of the
 Lanterne. Decides with a calm promptitude, which rises towards
 the sublime. One must needs vote, for the thing is self-evident,
 that his Majesty has been _abducted_, or spirited away,
 “_enlevé_,” by some person or persons unknown: in which case,
 what will the Constitution have us do? Let us return to first
 principles, as we always say; ‘_revenons aux principes_.’ By first or by second principles, much is promptly decided:
 Ministers are sent for, instructed how to continue their
 functions; Lafayette is examined; and Gouvion, who gives a most
 helpless account, the best he can. Letters are found written: one
 Letter, of immense magnitude; all in his Majesty’s hand, and
 evidently of his Majesty’s own composition; addressed to the
 National Assembly. It details, with earnestness, with a childlike
 simplicity, what woes his Majesty has suffered. Woes great and
 small: A Necker seen applauded, a Majesty not; then insurrection;
 want of due cash in Civil List; _general_ want of cash, furniture
 and order; anarchy everywhere; Deficit never yet, in the
 smallest, “choked or _comblé:_”—wherefore in brief His Majesty
 has retired towards a Place of Liberty; and, leaving Sanctions,
 Federation, and what Oaths there may be, to shift for themselves,
 does now refer—to what, thinks an august Assembly? To that
 “Declaration of the Twenty-third of June,” with its ‘_Seul il
 fera_, He alone will make his People happy.’ As if _that_ were
 not buried, deep enough, under two irrevocable Twelvemonths, and
 the wreck and rubbish of a whole Feudal World! This strange
 autograph Letter the National Assembly decides on printing; on
 transmitting to the Eighty-three Departments, with exegetic
 commentary, short but pithy. Commissioners also shall go forth on
 all sides; the People be exhorted; the Armies be increased; care
 taken that the Commonweal suffer no damage.—And now, with a
 sublime air of calmness, nay of indifference, we “pass to the
 order of the day!” By such sublime calmness, the terror of the People is calmed.
 These gleaming Pike forests, which bristled fateful in the early
 sun, disappear again; the far-sounding Street-orators cease, or
 spout milder. We are to have a civil war; let us have it then.
 The King is gone; but National Assembly, but France and we
 remain. The People also takes a great attitude; the People also
 is calm; motionless as a couchant lion. With but a few
 _broolings_, some waggings of the tail; to shew what it _will_
 do! Cazalès, for instance, was beset by street-groups, and cries
 of _Lanterne;_ but National Patrols easily delivered him.
 Likewise all King’s effigies and statues, at least stucco ones,
 get abolished. Even King’s names; the word Roi fades suddenly out
 of all shop-signs; the Royal Bengal Tiger itself, on the
 Boulevards, becomes the National Bengal one, _Tigre
 National_.[378]');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' How great is a calm couchant People! On the morrow, men will say
 to one another: ‘We have no King, yet we slept sound enough.’ On
 the morrow, fervent Achille de Chatelet, and Thomas Paine the
 rebellious Needleman, shall have the walls of Paris profusely
 plastered with their Placard; announcing that there must be a
 _Republic!_[379]—Need we add that Lafayette too, though at first
 menaced by Pikes, has taken a great attitude, or indeed the
 greatest of all? Scouts and Aides-de-camp fly forth, vague, in
 quest and pursuit; young Romœuf towards Valenciennes, though with
 small hope. Thus Paris; sublimely calmed, in its bereavement. But from the
 _Messageries Royales_, in all Mail-bags, radiates forth
 far-darting the electric news: Our Hereditary Representative is
 flown. Laugh, black Royalists: yet be it in your sleeve only;
 lest Patriotism notice, and waxing frantic, lower the Lanterne!
 In Paris alone is a sublime National Assembly with its calmness;
 truly, other places must take it as they can: with open mouth and
 eyes; with panic cackling, with wrath, with conjecture. How each
 one of those dull leathern Diligences, with its leathern bag and
 “The King is fled,” furrows up smooth France as it goes; through
 town and hamlet, ruffles the smooth public mind into quivering
 agitation of death-terror; then lumbers on, as if nothing had
 happened! Along all highways; towards the utmost borders; till
 all France is ruffled,—roughened up (metaphorically speaking)
 into one enormous, desperate-minded, red-guggling Turkey Cock! For example, it is under cloud of night that the leathern Monster
 reaches Nantes; deep sunk in sleep. The word spoken rouses all
 Patriot men: General Dumouriez, enveloped in roquelaures, has to
 descend from his bedroom; finds the street covered with “four or
 five thousand citizens in their shirts.”[380] Here and there a
 faint farthing rushlight, hastily kindled; and so many
 swart-featured haggard faces, with nightcaps pushed back; and the
 more or less flowing drapery of night-shirt: open-mouthed till
 the General say his word! And overhead, as always, the Great Bear
 is turning so quiet round Boötes; steady, indifferent as the
 leathern Diligence itself. Take comfort, ye men of Nantes: Boötes
 and the steady Bear are turning; ancient Atlantic still sends his
 brine, loud-billowing, up your Loire-stream; brandy shall be hot
 in the stomach: this is not the Last of the Days, but one before
 the Last.—The fools! If they knew what was doing, in these very
 instants, also by candle-light, in the far North-East! Perhaps we may say the most terrified man in Paris or France
 is—who thinks the Reader?—seagreen Robespierre. Double paleness,
 with the shadow of gibbets and halters, overcasts the seagreen
 features: it is too clear to him that there is to be “a
 Saint-Bartholomew of Patriots,” that in four-and-twenty hours he
 will not be in life. These horrid anticipations of the soul he is
 heard uttering at Pétion’s; by a notable witness. By Madame
 Roland, namely; her whom we saw, last year, radiant at the Lyons
 Federation! These four months, the Rolands have been in Paris;
 arranging with Assembly Committees the Municipal affairs of
 Lyons, affairs all sunk in debt;—communing, the while, as was
 most natural, with the best Patriots to be found here, with our
 Brissots, Pétions, Buzots, Robespierres; who were wont to come to
 us, says the fair Hostess, four evenings in the week. They,
 running about, busier than ever this day, would fain have
 comforted the seagreen man: spake of Achille du Chatelet’s
 Placard; of a Journal to be called _The Republican;_ of preparing
 men’s minds for a Republic. ‘A Republic?’ said the Seagreen, with
 one of his dry husky _un_sportful laughs, ‘What is that?’[381] O
 seagreen Incorruptible, thou shalt see!
 Chapter 2.4.V.
 The New Berline. But scouts all this while and aide-de-camps, have flown forth
 faster than the leathern Diligences. Young Romœuf, as we said,
 was off early towards Valenciennes: distracted Villagers seize
 him, as a traitor with a finger of his own in the plot; drag him
 back to the Townhall; to the National Assembly, which speedily
 grants a new passport. Nay now, that same scarecrow of an
 Herb-merchant with his ass has bethought him of the grand new
 Berline seen in the Wood of Bondy; and delivered evidence of
 it:[382] Romœuf, furnished with new passport, is sent forth with
 double speed on a hopefuller track; by Bondy, Claye, and Châlons,
 towards Metz, to track the new Berline; and gallops _à franc
 étrier_. Miserable new Berline! Why could not Royalty go in some old
 Berline similar to that of other men? Flying for life, one does
 not stickle about his vehicle. Monsieur, in a commonplace
 travelling-carriage is off Northwards; Madame, his Princess, in
 another, with variation of route: they cross one another while
 changing horses, without look of recognition; and reach Flanders,
 no man questioning them. Precisely in the same manner, beautiful
 Princess de Lamballe set off, about the same hour; and will reach
 England safe:—would she had continued there! The beautiful, the
 good, but the unfortunate; reserved for a frightful end! All runs along, unmolested, speedy, except only the new Berline.
 Huge leathern vehicle;—huge Argosy, let us say, or Acapulco-ship;
 with its heavy stern-boat of Chaise-and-pair; with its three
 yellow Pilot-boats of mounted Bodyguard Couriers, rocking aimless
 round it and ahead of it, to bewilder, not to guide! It lumbers
 along, lurchingly with stress, at a snail’s pace; noted of all
 the world. The Bodyguard Couriers, in their yellow liveries, go
 prancing and clattering; loyal but stupid; unacquainted with all
 things. Stoppages occur; and breakages to be repaired at Etoges.
 King Louis too will dismount, will walk up hills, and enjoy the
 blessed sunshine:—with eleven horses and double drink money, and
 all furtherances of Nature and Art, it will be found that
 Royalty, flying for life, accomplishes Sixty-nine miles in
 Twenty-two incessant hours. Slow Royalty! And yet not a minute of
 these hours but is precious: on minutes hang the destinies of
 Royalty now. Readers, therefore, can judge in what humour Duke de Choiseul
 might stand waiting, in the Village of Pont-de-Sommevelle, some
 leagues beyond Chalons, hour after hour, now when the day bends
 visibly westward. Choiseul drove out of Paris, in all privity,
 ten hours before their Majesties’ fixed time; his Hussars, led by
 Engineer Goguelat, are here duly, come “to escort a Treasure that
 is expected:” but, hour after hour, is no Baroness de Korff’s
 Berline. Indeed, over all that North-east Region, on the skirts
 of Champagne and of Lorraine, where the Great Road runs, the
 agitation is considerable. For all along, from this
 Pont-de-Sommevelle Northeastward as far as Montmédi, at
 Post-villages and Towns, escorts of Hussars and Dragoons do
 lounge waiting: a train or chain of Military Escorts; at the
 Montmédi end of it our brave Bouillé: an electric thunder-chain;
 which the invisible Bouillé, like a Father Jove, holds in his
 hand—for wise purposes! Brave Bouillé has done what man could;
 has spread out his electric thunder-chain of Military Escorts,
 onwards to the threshold of Chalons: it waits but for the new
 Korff Berline; to receive it, escort it, and, if need be, bear it
 off in whirlwind of military fire. They lie and lounge there, we
 say, these fierce Troopers; from Montmédi and Stenai, through
 Clermont, Sainte-Menehould to utmost Pont-de-Sommevelle, in all
 Post-villages; for the route shall avoid Verdun and great Towns:
 they loiter impatient “till the Treasure arrive.” Judge what a day this is for brave Bouillé: perhaps the first day
 of a new glorious life; surely the last day of the old! Also, and
 indeed still more, what a day, beautiful and terrible, for your
 young full-blooded Captains: your Dandoins, Comte de Damas, Duke
 de Choiseul, Engineer Goguelat, and the like; entrusted with the
 secret!—Alas, the day bends ever more westward; and no Korff
 Berline comes to sight. It is four hours beyond the time, and
 still no Berline. In all Village-streets, Royalist Captains go
 lounging, looking often Paris-ward; with face of unconcern, with
 heart full of black care: rigorous Quartermasters can hardly keep
 the private dragoons from _cafés_ and dramshops.[383] Dawn on our
 bewilderment, thou new Berline; dawn on us, thou Sun-chariot of a
 new Berline, with the destinies of France! It was of His Majesty’s ordering, this military array of Escorts:
 a thing solacing the Royal imagination with a look of security
 and rescue; yet, in reality, creating only alarm, and where there
 was otherwise no danger, danger without end. For each Patriot, in
 these Post-villages, asks naturally: This clatter of cavalry, and
 marching and lounging of troops, what means it? To escort a
 Treasure? Why escort, when no Patriot will steal from the Nation;
 or where is your Treasure?—There has been such marching and
 counter-marching: for it is another fatality, that certain of
 these Military Escorts came out so early as yesterday; the
 Nineteenth not the Twentieth of the month being the day _first_
 appointed, which her Majesty, for some necessity or other, saw
 good to alter. And now consider the suspicious nature of
 Patriotism; suspicious, above all, of Bouillé the Aristocrat; and
 how the sour doubting humour has had leave to accumulate and
 exacerbate for four-and-twenty hours! At Pont-de-Sommevelle, these Forty foreign Hussars of Goguelat
 and Duke Choiseul are becoming an unspeakable mystery to all men.
 They lounged long enough, already, at Sainte-Menehould; lounged
 and loitered till our National Volunteers there, all risen into
 hot wrath of doubt, “demanded three hundred fusils of their
 Townhall,” and got them. At which same moment too, as it chanced,
 our Captain Dandoins was just coming in, from Clermont with _his_
 troop, at the other end of the Village. A fresh troop; alarming
 enough; though happily they are only Dragoons and French! So that
 Goguelat with his Hussars had to ride, and even to do it fast;
 till here at Pont-de-Sommevelle, where Choiseul lay waiting, he
 found resting-place. Resting-place, as on burning marle. For the
 rumour of him flies abroad; and men run to and fro in fright and
 anger: Chalons sends forth exploratory pickets, coming from
 Sainte-Menehould, on that. What is it, ye whiskered Hussars, men
 of foreign guttural speech; in the name of Heaven, what is it
 that brings you? A Treasure?—exploratory pickets shake their
 heads. The hungry Peasants, however, know too well what Treasure
 it is: Military seizure for rents, feudalities; which no Bailiff
 could make us pay! This they know;—and set to jingling their
 Parish-bell by way of tocsin; with rapid effect! Choiseul and
 Goguelat, if the whole country is not to take fire, must needs,
 be there Berline, be there no Berline, saddle and ride. They mount; and this Parish tocsin happily ceases. They ride
 slowly Eastward, towards Sainte-Menehould; still hoping the
 Sun-Chariot of a Berline may overtake them. Ah me, no Berline!
 And near now is that Sainte-Menehould, which expelled us in the
 morning, with its “three hundred National fusils;” which looks,
 belike, not too lovingly on Captain Dandoins and his fresh
 Dragoons, though only French;—which, in a word, one dare not
 enter the _second_ time, under pain of explosion! With rather
 heavy heart, our Hussar Party strikes off to the left; through
 byways, through pathless hills and woods, they, avoiding
 Sainte-Menehould and all places which have seen them heretofore,
 will make direct for the distant Village of Varennes. It is
 probable they will have a rough evening-ride. This first military post, therefore, in the long thunder-chain,
 has gone off with no effect; or with worse, and your chain
 threatens to entangle itself!—The Great Road, however, is got
 hushed again into a kind of quietude, though one of the
 wakefullest. Indolent Dragoons cannot, by any Quartermaster, be
 kept altogether from the dramshop; where Patriots drink, and will
 even treat, eager enough for news. Captains, in a state near
 distraction, beat the dusky highway, with a face of indifference;
 and no Sun-Chariot appears. Why lingers it? Incredible, that with
 eleven horses and such yellow Couriers and furtherances, its rate
 should be under the weightiest dray-rate, some three miles an
 hour! Alas, one knows not whether it ever even got out of
 Paris;—and yet also one knows not whether, this very moment, it
 is not at the Village-end! One’s heart flutters on the verge of
 unutterabilities.
 Chapter 2.4.VI.
 Old-Dragoon Drouet. In this manner, however, has the Day bent downwards. Wearied
 mortals are creeping home from their field-labour; the
 village-artisan eats with relish his supper of herbs, or has
 strolled forth to the village-street for a sweet mouthful of air
 and human news. Still summer-eventide everywhere! The great Sun
 hangs flaming on the utmost North-West; for it is his longest day
 this year. The hill-tops rejoicing will ere long be at their
 ruddiest, and blush Good-night. The thrush, in green dells, on
 long-shadowed leafy spray, pours gushing his glad serenade, to
 the babble of brooks grown audibler; silence is stealing over the
 Earth. Your dusty Mill of Valmy, as all other mills and
 drudgeries, may furl its canvass, and cease swashing and
 circling. The swenkt grinders in this Treadmill of an Earth have
 ground out another Day; and lounge there, as we say, in
 village-groups; movable, or ranked on social stone-seats;[384]
 their children, mischievous imps, sporting about their feet.
 Unnotable hum of sweet human gossip rises from this Village of
 Sainte-Menehould, as from all other villages. Gossip mostly
 sweet, unnotable; for the very Dragoons are French and gallant;
 nor as yet has the Paris-and-Verdun Diligence, with its leathern
 bag, rumbled in, to terrify the minds of men. One figure nevertheless we do note at the last door of the
 Village: that figure in loose-flowing nightgown, of Jean Baptiste
 Drouet, Master of the Post here. An acrid choleric man, rather
 dangerous-looking; still in the prime of life, though he has
 served, in his time as a Condé Dragoon. This day from an early
 hour, Drouet got his choler stirred, and has been kept fretting.
 Hussar Goguelat in the morning saw good, by way of thrift, to
 bargain with his own Innkeeper, not with Drouet regular _Maître
 de Poste_, about some gig-horse for the sending back of his gig;
 which thing Drouet perceiving came over in red ire, menacing the
 Inn-keeper, and would not be appeased. Wholly an unsatisfactory
 day. For Drouet is an acrid Patriot too, was at the Paris Feast
 of Pikes: and what do these Bouillé Soldiers mean? Hussars, with
 their gig, and a vengeance to it!—have hardly been thrust out,
 when Dandoins and his fresh Dragoons arrive from Clermont, and
 stroll. For what purpose? Choleric Drouet steps out and steps in,
 with long-flowing nightgown; looking abroad, with that sharpness
 of faculty which stirred choler gives to man. On the other hand, mark Captain Dandoins on the street of that
 same Village; sauntering with a face of indifference, a heart
 eaten of black care! For no Korff Berline makes its appearance.
 The great Sun flames broader towards setting: one’s heart
 flutters on the verge of dread unutterabilities. By Heaven! Here is the yellow Bodyguard Courier; spurring fast,
 in the ruddy evening light! Steady, O Dandoins, stand with
 inscrutable indifferent face; though the yellow blockhead spurs
 past the Post-house; inquires to find it; and stirs the Village,
 all delighted with his fine livery.—Lumbering along with its
 mountains of bandboxes, and Chaise behind, the Korff Berline
 rolls in; huge Acapulco-ship with its Cockboat, having got thus
 far. The eyes of the Villagers look enlightened, as such eyes do
 when a coach-transit, which is an event, occurs for them.
 Strolling Dragoons respectfully, so fine are the yellow liveries,
 bring hand to helmet; and a lady in gipsy-hat responds with a
 grace peculiar to her.[385] Dandoins stands with folded arms, and
 what look of indifference and disdainful garrison-air a man can,
 while the heart is like leaping out of him. Curled disdainful
 moustachio; careless glance,—which however surveys the
 Village-groups, and does not like them. With his eye he bespeaks
 the yellow Courier. Be quick, be quick! Thick-headed Yellow
 cannot understand the eye; comes up mumbling, to ask in words:
 seen of the Village! Nor is Post-master Drouet unobservant, all this while; but steps
 out and steps in, with his long-flowing nightgown, in the level
 sunlight; prying into several things. When a man’s faculties, at
 the right time, are sharpened by choler, it may lead to much.
 That Lady in slouched gypsy-hat, though sitting back in the
 Carriage, does she not resemble some one we have seen, some
 time;—at the Feast of Pikes, or elsewhere? And this _Grosse-Tête_
 in round hat and peruke, which, looking rearward, pokes itself
 out from time to time, methinks there are features in it—? Quick,
 Sieur Guillaume, Clerk of the _Directoire_, bring me a new
 Assignat! Drouet scans the new Assignat; compares the Paper-money
 Picture with the Gross-Head in round hat there: by Day and Night!
 you might say the one was an attempted Engraving of the other.
 And this march of Troops; this sauntering and whispering,—I see
 it! Drouet Post-master of this Village, hot Patriot, Old Dragoon of
 Condé, consider, therefore, what thou wilt do. And fast: for
 behold the new Berline, expeditiously yoked, cracks whipcord, and
 rolls away!—Drouet dare not, on the spur of the instant, clutch
 the bridles in his own two hands; Dandoins, with broadsword,
 might hew you off. Our poor Nationals, not one of them here, have
 three hundred fusils but then no powder; besides one is not sure,
 only morally-certain. Drouet, as an adroit Old-Dragoon of Condé
 does what is advisablest: privily bespeaks Clerk Guillaume,
 Old-Dragoon of Condé he too; privily, while Clerk Guillaume is
 saddling two of the fleetest horses, slips over to the Townhall
 to whisper a word; then mounts with Clerk Guillaume; and the two
 bound eastward in pursuit, to _see_ what can be done. They bound eastward, in sharp trot; their moral-certainty
 permeating the Village, from the Townhall outwards, in busy
 whispers. Alas! Captain Dandoins orders his Dragoons to mount;
 but they, complaining of long fast, demand bread-and-cheese
 first;—before which brief repast can be eaten, the whole Village
 is permeated; not whispering now, but blustering and shrieking!
 National Volunteers, in hurried muster, shriek for gunpowder;
 Dragoons halt between Patriotism and Rule of the Service, between
 bread and cheese and fixed bayonets: Dandoins hands secretly his
 Pocket-book, with its secret despatches, to the rigorous
 Quartermaster: the very Ostlers have stable-forks and flails. The
 rigorous Quartermaster, half-saddled, cuts out his way with the
 sword’s edge, amid levelled bayonets, amid Patriot vociferations,
 adjurations, flail-strokes; and rides frantic;[386]—few or even
 none following him; the rest, so sweetly constrained consenting
 to stay there. And thus the new Berline rolls; and Drouet and Guillaume gallop
 after it, and Dandoins’s Troopers or Trooper gallops after them;
 and Sainte-Menehould, with some leagues of the King’s Highway, is
 in explosion;—and your Military thunder-chain has gone off in a
 self-destructive manner; one may fear with the frightfullest
 issues!
 Chapter 2.4.VII.
 The Night of Spurs. This comes of mysterious Escorts, and a new Berline with eleven
 horses: “he that has a secret should not only hide it, but hide
 that he has it to hide.” Your first Military Escort has exploded
 self-destructive; and all Military Escorts, and a suspicious
 Country will now be up, explosive; comparable _not_ to victorious
 thunder. Comparable, say rather, to the first stirring of an
 Alpine Avalanche; which, once stir it, as here at
 Sainte-Menehould, will spread,—all round, and on and on, as far
 as Stenai; thundering with wild ruin, till Patriot Villagers,
 Peasantry, Military Escorts, new Berline and Royalty are
 down,—jumbling in the Abyss! The thick shades of Night are falling. Postillions crack the
 whip: the Royal Berline is through Clermont, where Colonel Comte
 de Damas got a word whispered to it; is safe through, towards
 Varennes; rushing at the rate of double drink-money: an Unknown
 “_Inconnu_ on horseback” shrieks earnestly some hoarse whisper,
 not audible, into the rushing Carriage-window, and vanishes, left
 in the night.[387] August Travellers palpitate; nevertheless
 overwearied Nature sinks every one of them into a kind of sleep.
 Alas, and Drouet and Clerk Guillaume spur; taking side-roads, for
 shortness, for safety; scattering abroad that moral-certainty of
 theirs; which flies, a bird of the air carrying it! And your rigorous Quartermaster spurs; awakening hoarse
 trumpet-tone, as here at Clermont, calling out Dragoons gone to
 bed. Brave Colonel de Damas has them mounted, in part, these
 Clermont men; young Cornet Remy dashes off with a few. But the
 Patriot Magistracy is out here at Clermont too; National Guards
 shrieking for ball-cartridges; and the Village “illuminates
 itself;”—deft Patriots springing out of bed; alertly, in shirt or
 shift, striking a light; sticking up each his farthing candle, or
 penurious oil-cruise, till all glitters and glimmers; so deft are
 they! A _camisado_, or shirt-tumult, every where: stormbell set
 a-ringing; village-drum beating furious _générale_, as here at
 Clermont, under illumination; distracted Patriots pleading and
 menacing! Brave young Colonel de Damas, in that uproar of
 distracted Patriotism, speaks some fire-sentences to what
 Troopers he has: ‘Comrades insulted at Sainte-Menehould; King and
 Country calling on the brave;’ then gives the fire-word, _Draw
 swords_. Whereupon, alas, the Troopers only _smite_ their
 sword-handles, driving them further home! ‘To me, whoever is for
 the King!’ cries Damas in despair; and gallops, he with some poor
 loyal Two, of the subaltern sort, into the bosom of the
 Night.[388] Night unexampled in the Clermontais; shortest of the year;
 remarkablest of the century: Night deserving to be named of
 Spurs! Cornet Remy, and those Few he dashed off with, has missed
 his road; is galloping for hours towards Verdun; then, for hours,
 across hedged country, through roused hamlets, towards Varennes.
 Unlucky Cornet Remy; unluckier Colonel Damas, with whom there
 ride desperate only some loyal Two! More ride not of that
 Clermont Escort: of other Escorts, in other Villages, not even
 Two may ride; but only all curvet and prance,—impeded by
 stormbell and your Village illuminating itself. And Drouet rides and Clerk Guillaume; and the Country
 runs.—Goguelat and Duke Choiseul are plunging through morasses,
 over cliffs, over stock and stone, in the shaggy woods of the
 Clermontais; by tracks; or trackless, with guides; Hussars
 tumbling into pitfalls, and lying “swooned three quarters of an
 hour,” the rest refusing to march without them. What an
 evening-ride from Pont-de-Sommerville; what a thirty hours, since
 Choiseul quitted Paris, with Queen’s-valet Leonard in the chaise
 by him! Black Care sits behind the rider. Thus go they plunging;
 rustle the owlet from his branchy nest; champ the sweet-scented
 forest-herb, queen-of-the-meadows _spilling_ her spikenard; and
 frighten the ear of Night. But hark! towards twelve o’clock, as
 one guesses, for the very stars are gone out: sound of the tocsin
 from Varennes? Checking bridle, the Hussar Officer listens: ‘Some
 fire undoubtedly!’—yet rides on, with double breathlessness, to
 verify. Yes, gallant friends that do your utmost, it is a certain sort of
 fire: difficult to quench.—The Korff Berline, fairly ahead of all
 this riding Avalanche, reached the little paltry Village of
 Varennes about eleven o’clock; hopeful, in spite of that
 horse-whispering Unknown. Do not all towns now lie behind us;
 Verdun avoided, on our right? Within wind of Bouillé himself, in
 a manner; and the darkest of midsummer nights favouring us! And
 so we halt on the hill-top at the South end of the Village;
 expecting our relay; which young Bouillé, Bouillé’s own son, with
 his Escort of Hussars, was to have ready; for in this Village is
 no Post. Distracting to think of: neither horse nor Hussar is
 here! Ah, and stout horses, a proper relay belonging to Duke
 Choiseul, do stand at hay, but in the Upper Village over the
 Bridge; and we know not of them. Hussars likewise do wait, but
 drinking in the taverns. For indeed it is six hours beyond the
 time; young Bouillé, silly stripling, thinking the matter over
 for this night, has retired to bed. And so our yellow Couriers,
 inexperienced, must rove, groping, bungling, through a Village
 mostly asleep: Postillions will not, for any money, go on with
 the tired horses; not at least without refreshment; not they, let
 the Valet in round hat argue as he likes. Miserable! “For five-and-thirty minutes” by the King’s watch, the
 Berline is at a dead stand; Round-hat arguing with Churnboots;
 tired horses slobbering their meal-and-water; yellow Couriers
 groping, bungling;—young Bouillé asleep, all the while, in the
 Upper Village, and Choiseul’s fine team standing there at hay. No
 help for it; not with a King’s ransom: the horses deliberately
 slobber, Round-hat argues, Bouillé sleeps. And mark now, in the
 thick night, do not two Horsemen, with jaded trot, come
 clank-clanking; and start with half-pause, if one noticed them,
 at sight of this dim mass of a Berline, and its dull slobbering
 and arguing; then prick off faster, into the Village? It is
 Drouet, he and Clerk Guillaume! Still ahead, they two, of the
 whole riding hurlyburly; unshot, though some brag of having
 chased them. Perilous is Drouet’s errand also; but he is an
 Old-Dragoon, with his wits shaken thoroughly awake. The Village of Varennes lies dark and slumberous; a most unlevel
 Village, of inverse saddle-shape, as men write. It sleeps; the
 rushing of the River Aire singing lullaby to it. Nevertheless
 from the Golden Arms, _Bras d’Or_ Tavern, across that sloping
 marketplace, there still comes shine of social light; comes voice
 of rude drovers, or the like, who have not yet taken the
 stirrup-cup; Boniface Le Blanc, in white apron, serving them:
 cheerful to behold. To this _Bras d’Or_, Drouet enters, alacrity
 looking through his eyes: he nudges Boniface, in all privacy,
 ‘_Camarade, es-tu bon Patriote_, Art thou a good Patriot?’—‘_Si
 je suis!_’ answers Boniface.—‘In that case,’ eagerly whispers
 Drouet—what whisper is needful, heard of Boniface alone.[389] And now see Boniface Le Blanc bustling, as he never did for the
 jolliest toper. See Drouet and Guillaume, dexterous Old-Dragoons,
 instantly down blocking the Bridge, with a “furniture waggon they
 find there,” with whatever waggons, tumbrils, barrels, barrows
 their hands can lay hold of;—till no carriage can pass. Then
 swiftly, the Bridge once blocked, see them take station hard by,
 under Varennes Archway: joined by Le Blanc, Le Blanc’s Brother,
 and one or two alert Patriots he has roused. Some half-dozen in
 all, with National Muskets, they stand close, waiting under the
 Archway, till that same Korff Berline rumble up. It rumbles up: _Alte là!_ lanterns flash out from under
 coat-skirts, bridles chuck in strong fists, two National Muskets
 level themselves fore and aft through the two Coach-doors:
 ‘Mesdames, your Passports?’—Alas! Alas! Sieur Sausse, Procureur
 of the Township, Tallow-chandler also and Grocer is there, with
 official grocer-politeness; Drouet with fierce logic and ready
 wit:—The respected Travelling Party, be it Baroness de Korff’s,
 or persons of still higher consequence, will perhaps please to
 rest itself in M. Sausse’s till the dawn strike up! O Louis; O hapless Marie-Antoinette, fated to pass thy life with
 such men! Phlegmatic Louis, art thou but lazy semi-animate phlegm
 then, to the centre of thee? King, Captain-General, Sovereign
 Frank! If thy heart ever formed, since it began beating under the
 name of heart, any resolution at all, be it now then, or never in
 this world: ‘Violent nocturnal individuals, and if it were
 persons of high consequence? And if it were the King himself? Has
 the King not the power, which all beggars have, of travelling
 unmolested on his own Highway? Yes: it is the King; and tremble
 ye to know it! The King has said, in this one small matter; and
 in France, or under God’s Throne, is no power that shall gainsay.
 Not the King shall ye stop here under this your miserable
 Archway; but his dead body only, and answer it to Heaven and
 Earth. To me, Bodyguards: Postillions, _en avant!_’—One fancies
 in that case the pale paralysis of these two Le Blanc musketeers;
 the drooping of Drouet’s under-jaw; and how Procureur Sausse had
 melted like tallow in furnace-heat: Louis faring on; in some few
 steps awakening Young Bouillé, awakening relays and hussars:
 triumphant entry, with cavalcading high-brandishing Escort, and
 Escorts, into Montmédi; and the whole course of French History
 different! Alas, it was not _in_ the poor phlegmatic man. Had it been in
 him, French History had never come under this Varennes Archway to
 decide itself.—He steps out; all step out. Procureur Sausse gives
 his grocer-arms to the Queen and Sister Elizabeth; Majesty taking
 the two children by the hand. And thus they walk, coolly back,
 over the Marketplace, to Procureur Sausse’s; mount into his small
 upper story; where straightway his Majesty “demands
 refreshments.” Demands refreshments, as is written; gets
 bread-and-cheese with a bottle of Burgundy; and remarks, that it
 is the best Burgundy he ever drank!');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Meanwhile, the Varennes Notables, and all men, official, and
 non-official, are hastily drawing on their breeches; getting
 their fighting-gear. Mortals half-dressed tumble out barrels, lay
 felled trees; scouts dart off to all the four winds,—the tocsin
 begins clanging, “the Village illuminates itself.” Very singular:
 how these little Villages do manage, so adroit are they, when
 startled in midnight alarm of war. Like little adroit municipal
 rattle-snakes, suddenly awakened: for their stormbell rattles and
 rings; their eyes glisten luminous (with tallow-light), as in
 rattle-snake ire; and the Village will _sting!_ Old-Dragoon
 Drouet is our engineer and generalissimo; valiant as a Ruy
 Diaz:—Now or never, ye Patriots, for the Soldiery is coming;
 massacre by Austrians, by Aristocrats, wars more than civil, it
 all depends on you and the hour!—National Guards rank themselves,
 half-buttoned: mortals, we say, still only in breeches, in
 under-petticoat, tumble out barrels and lumber, lay felled trees
 for barricades: the Village will _sting_. Rabid Democracy, it
 would seem, is _not_ confined to Paris, then? Ah no, whatsoever
 Courtiers might talk; too clearly no. This of dying for one’s
 King is grown into a dying for one’s self, _against_ the King, if
 need be. And so our riding and running Avalanche and Hurlyburly has
 _reached_ the Abyss, Korff Berline foremost; and may pour itself
 thither, and jumble: endless! For the next six hours, need we ask
 if there was a clattering far and wide? Clattering and tocsining
 and hot tumult, over all the Clermontais, spreading through the
 Three Bishopricks: Dragoon and Hussar Troops galloping on roads
 and no-roads; National Guards arming and starting in the dead of
 night; tocsin after tocsin transmitting the alarm. In some forty
 minutes, Goguelat and Choiseul, with their wearied Hussars, reach
 Varennes. Ah, it is no fire then; or a fire difficult to quench!
 They leap the tree-barricades, in spite of National serjeant;
 they enter the village, Choiseul instructing his Troopers how the
 matter really is; who respond interjectionally, in their guttural
 dialect, ‘_Der König; die Königinn!_’ and seem stanch. These now,
 in their stanch humour, will, for one thing, beset Procureur
 Sausse’s house. Most beneficial: had not Drouet stormfully
 ordered otherwise; and even bellowed, in his extremity,
 ‘Cannoneers to your guns!’—two old honey-combed Field-pieces,
 empty of all but cobwebs; the rattle whereof, as the Cannoneers
 with assured countenance trundled them up, did nevertheless abate
 the Hussar ardour, and produce a respectfuller ranking further
 back. Jugs of wine, handed over the ranks, for the German throat
 too has sensibility, will complete the business. When Engineer
 Goguelat, some hour or so afterwards, steps forth, the response
 to him is—a hiccuping _Vive la Nation!_ What boots it? Goguelat, Choiseul, now also Count Damas, and all
 the Varennes Officiality are with the King; and the King can give
 no order, form no opinion; but sits there, as he has ever done,
 like clay on potter’s wheel; perhaps the absurdest of all
 pitiable and pardonable clay-figures that now circle under the
 Moon. He will go on, next morning, and take the National Guard
 _with_ him; Sausse permitting! Hapless Queen: with her two
 children laid there on the mean bed, old Mother Sausse kneeling
 to Heaven, with tears and an audible prayer, to bless them;
 imperial Marie-Antoinette near kneeling to Son Sausse and Wife
 Sausse, amid candle-boxes and treacle-barrels,—in vain! There are
 Three-thousand National Guards got in; before long they will
 count Ten-thousand; tocsins spreading like fire on dry heath, or
 far faster. Young Bouillé, roused by this Varennes tocsin, has taken horse,
 and—fled towards his Father. Thitherward also rides, in an almost
 hysterically desperate manner, a certain Sieur Aubriot,
 Choiseul’s Orderly; swimming dark rivers, our Bridge being
 blocked; spurring as if the Hell-hunt were at his heels.[390]
 Through the village of Dun, he, galloping still on, scatters the
 alarm; at Dun, brave Captain Deslons and _his_ Escort of a
 Hundred, saddle and ride. Deslons too gets into Varennes; leaving
 his Hundred outside, at the tree-barricade; offers to cut King
 Louis out, if he will order it: but unfortunately ‘the work
 _will_ prove hot;’ whereupon King Louis has ‘no orders to
 give.’[391] And so the tocsin clangs, and Dragoons gallop; and can do
 nothing, having gallopped: National Guards stream in like the
 gathering of ravens: your exploding Thunder-chain, falling
 Avalanche, or what else we liken it to, does play, with a
 vengeance,—up now as far as Stenai and Bouillé himself.[392]
 Brave Bouillé, son of the whirlwind, he saddles Royal Allemand;
 speaks fire-words, kindling heart and eyes; distributes
 twenty-five gold-louis a company:—Ride, Royal-Allemand,
 long-famed: no Tuileries Charge and Necker-Orleans
 Bust-Procession; a very King made captive, and world all to
 win!—Such is the Night deserving to be named of Spurs. At six o’clock two things have happened. Lafayette’s
 Aide-de-camp, Romœuf, riding _à franc étrier_, on that old
 Herb-merchant’s route, quickened during the last stages, has got
 to Varennes; where the Ten thousand now furiously demand, with
 fury of panic terror, that Royalty shall forthwith return
 Paris-ward, that there be not infinite bloodshed. Also, on the
 other side, “English Tom,” Choiseul’s _jokei_, flying with that
 Choiseul relay, has met Bouillé on the heights of Dun; the
 adamantine brow flushed with dark thunder; thunderous rattle of
 Royal Allemand at his heels. English Tom answers as he can the
 brief question, How it is at Varennes?—then asks in turn what he,
 English Tom, with M. de Choiseul’s horses, is to do, and whither
 to ride?—To the Bottomless Pool! answers a thunder-voice; then
 again speaking and spurring, orders Royal Allemand to the gallop;
 and vanishes, swearing (_en jurant_).[393] ’Tis the last of our
 brave Bouillé. Within sight of Varennes, he having drawn bridle,
 calls a council of officers; finds that it is in vain. King Louis
 has departed, consenting: amid the clangour of universal
 stormbell; amid the tramp of Ten thousand armed men, already
 arrived; and say, of Sixty thousand flocking thither. Brave
 Deslons, even without “orders,” darted at the River Aire with his
 Hundred![394] swam one branch of it, could not the other; and
 stood there, dripping and panting, with inflated nostril; the Ten
 thousand answering him with a shout of mockery, the new Berline
 lumbering Paris-ward its weary inevitable way. No help, then in
 Earth; nor in an age, not of miracles, in Heaven! That night, “Marquis de Bouillé and twenty-one more of us rode
 over the Frontiers; the Bernardine monks at Orval in Luxemburg
 gave us supper and lodging.”[395] With little of speech, Bouillé
 rides; with thoughts that do not brook speech. Northward, towards
 uncertainty, and the Cimmerian Night: towards West-Indian Isles,
 for with thin Emigrant delirium the son of the whirlwind cannot
 act; towards England, towards premature Stoical death; not
 towards France any more. Honour to the Brave; who, be it in this
 quarrel or in that, _is_ a substance and articulate-speaking
 piece of Human Valour, not a fanfaronading hollow Spectrum and
 squeaking and gibbering Shadow! One of the few Royalist
 Chief-actors this Bouillé, of whom so much can be said. The brave Bouillé too, then, vanishes from the tissue of our
 Story. Story and tissue, faint ineffectual Emblem of that grand
 Miraculous Tissue, and Living Tapestry named _French Revolution_,
 which did weave itself then in very fact, “on the loud-sounding
 “LOOM OF TIME!” The old Brave drop out from it, with their
 strivings; and new acrid Drouets, of new strivings and colour,
 come in:—as is the manner of that weaving.
 Chapter 2.4.VIII.
 The Return. So then our grand Royalist Plot, of Flight to Metz, has
 _executed_ itself. Long hovering in the background, as a dread
 royal _ultimatum_, it has rushed forward in its terrors: verily
 to some purpose. How many Royalist Plots and Projects, one after
 another, cunningly-devised, that were to explode like
 powder-mines and thunderclaps; not one solitary Plot of which has
 issued otherwise! Powder-mine of a _Séance Royale_ on the
 Twenty-third of June 1789, which exploded as we then said,
 “through the touchhole;” which next, your wargod Broglie having
 reloaded it, brought a Bastille about your ears. Then came
 fervent Opera-Repast, with flourishing of sabres, and _O Richard,
 O my King;_ which, aided by Hunger, produces Insurrection of
 Women, and Pallas Athene in the shape of Demoiselle Théroigne.
 Valour profits not; neither has fortune smiled on Fanfaronade.
 The Bouillé Armament ends as the Broglie one had done. Man after
 man spends himself in this cause, only to work it quicker ruin;
 it seems a cause doomed, forsaken of Earth and Heaven. On the Sixth of October gone a year, King Louis, escorted by
 Demoiselle Théroigne and some two hundred thousand, made a Royal
 Progress and Entrance into Paris, such as man had never
 witnessed: we prophesied him Two more such; and accordingly
 another of them, after this Flight to Metz, is now coming to
 pass. Théroigne will not escort here, neither does Mirabeau now
 “sit in one of the accompanying carriages.” Mirabeau lies dead,
 in the Pantheon of Great Men. Théroigne lies living, in dark
 Austrian Prison; having gone to Liège, professionally, and been
 seized there. Bemurmured now by the hoarse-flowing Danube; the
 light of her Patriot Supper-Parties gone quite out; so lies
 Théroigne: she shall speak with the Kaiser face to face, and
 return. And France lies how! Fleeting Time shears down the great
 and the little; and in two years alters many things. But at all events, here, we say, is a second Ignominious Royal
 Procession, though much altered; to be witnessed also by its
 hundreds of thousands. Patience, ye Paris Patriots; the Royal
 Berline is returning. Not till Saturday: for the Royal Berline
 travels by slow stages; amid such loud-voiced confluent sea of
 National Guards, sixty thousand as they count; amid such tumult
 of all people. Three National-Assembly Commissioners, famed
 Barnave, famed Pétion, generally-respectable Latour-Maubourg,
 have gone to meet it; of whom the two former ride in the Berline
 itself beside Majesty, day after day. Latour, as a mere
 respectability, and man of whom all men speak well, can ride in
 the rear, with Dame Tourzel and the _Soubrettes_. So on Saturday evening, about seven o’clock, Paris by hundreds of
 thousands is again drawn up: not now dancing the tricolor
 joy-dance of hope; nor as yet dancing in fury-dance of hate and
 revenge; but in silence, with vague look of conjecture and
 curiosity mostly scientific. A Sainte-Antoine Placard has given
 notice this morning that “whosoever insults Louis shall be caned,
 whosoever applauds him shall be hanged.” Behold then, at last,
 that wonderful New Berline; encircled by blue National sea with
 fixed bayonets, which flows slowly, floating it on, through the
 silent assembled hundreds of thousands. Three yellow Couriers sit
 atop bound with ropes; Pétion, Barnave, their Majesties, with
 Sister Elizabeth, and the Children of France, are within. Smile of embarrassment, or cloud of dull sourness, is on the
 broad phlegmatic face of his Majesty: who keeps declaring to the
 successive Official-persons, what is evident, ‘_Eh bien, me
 voilà_, Well, here you have me;’ and what is not evident, ‘I do
 assure you I did not mean to pass the frontiers;’ and so forth:
 speeches natural for that poor Royal man; which Decency would
 veil. Silent is her Majesty, with a look of grief and scorn;
 natural for that Royal Woman. Thus lumbers and creeps the
 ignominious Royal Procession, through many streets, amid a
 silent-gazing people: comparable, Mercier thinks,[396] to some
 _Procession de Roi de Bazoche;_ or say, Procession of King
 Crispin, with his Dukes of Sutor-mania and royal blazonry of
 Cordwainery. Except indeed that this is not comic; ah no, it is
 comico-tragic; with bound Couriers, and a Doom hanging over it;
 most fantastic, yet most miserably real. Miserablest _flebile
 ludibrium_ of a Pickleherring Tragedy! It sweeps along there, in
 most ungorgeous pall, through many streets, in the dusty summer
 evening; gets itself at length wriggled out of sight; vanishing
 in the Tuileries Palace—towards its doom, of slow torture, _peine
 forte et dure_. Populace, it is true, seizes the three rope-bound yellow
 Couriers; will at least massacre _them_. But our august Assembly,
 which is sitting at this great moment, sends out Deputation of
 rescue; and the whole is got huddled up. Barnave, “all dusty,” is
 already there, in the National Hall; making brief discreet
 address and report. As indeed, through the whole journey, this
 Barnave has been most discreet, sympathetic; and has gained the
 Queen’s trust, whose noble instinct teaches her always who is to
 be trusted. Very different from heavy Pétion; who, if Campan
 speak truth, ate his luncheon, comfortably filled his wine-glass,
 in the Royal Berline; flung out his chicken-bones past the nose
 of Royalty itself; and, on the King’s saying ‘France cannot be a
 Republic,’ answered ‘No, it is not ripe yet.’ Barnave is
 henceforth a Queen’s adviser, if advice could profit: and her
 Majesty astonishes Dame Campan by signifying almost a regard for
 Barnave: and that, in a day of retribution and Royal triumph,
 Barnave shall _not_ be executed.[397] On Monday night Royalty went; on Saturday evening it returns: so
 much, within one short week, has Royalty accomplished for itself.
 The Pickleherring Tragedy has vanished in the Tuileries Palace,
 towards “pain strong and hard.” Watched, fettered, and humbled,
 as Royalty never was. Watched even in its sleeping-apartments and
 inmost recesses: for it has to sleep with door set ajar, blue
 National Argus watching, his eye fixed on the Queen’s curtains;
 nay, on one occasion, as the Queen cannot sleep, he offers to sit
 by her pillow, and converse a little![398]
 Chapter 2.4.IX.
 Sharp Shot. In regard to all which, this most pressing question arises: What
 is to be done with it? ‘Depose it!’ resolutely answer Robespierre
 and the thoroughgoing few. For truly, with a King who runs away,
 and needs to be watched in his very bedroom that he may stay and
 govern you, what other reasonable thing can be done? Had Philippe
 d’Orléans not been a _caput mortuum!_ But of him, known as one
 defunct, no man now dreams. ‘Depose it not; say that it is
 inviolable, that it was spirited away, was _enlevé;_ at any cost
 of sophistry and solecism, reestablish it!’ so answer with loud
 vehemence all manner of Constitutional Royalists; as all your
 Pure Royalists do naturally likewise, with low vehemence, and
 rage compressed by fear, still more passionately answer. Nay
 Barnave and the two Lameths, and what will follow them, do
 likewise answer so. Answer, with their whole might: terror-struck
 at the unknown Abysses on the verge of which, driven thither by
 themselves mainly, all now reels, ready to plunge. By mighty effort and combination this latter course, of
 reestablish it, is the course fixed on; and it shall by the
 strong arm, if not by the clearest logic, be made good. With the
 sacrifice of all their hard-earned popularity, this notable
 Triumvirate, says Toulongeon, “set the Throne up again, which
 they had so toiled to overturn: as one might set up an overturned
 pyramid, on its vertex; to stand so long as it is _held_.” Unhappy France; unhappy in King, Queen, and Constitution; one
 knows not in which unhappiest! Was the meaning of our so glorious
 French Revolution this, and no other, That when Shams and
 Delusions, long soul-killing, had become body-killing, and got
 the length of Bankruptcy and Inanition, a great People rose and,
 with one voice, said, in the Name of the Highest: _Shams shall be
 no more?_ So many sorrows and bloody horrors, endured, and to be
 yet endured through dismal coming centuries, were they not the
 heavy price paid and payable for this same: Total Destruction of
 Shams from among men? And now, O Barnave Triumvirate! is it in
 such _double_-distilled Delusion, and Sham even of a Sham, that
 an Effort of this kind will rest acquiescent? Messieurs of the
 popular Triumvirate: Never! But, after all, what can poor popular
 Triumvirates and fallible august Senators do? They can, when the
 Truth is all too-horrible, stick their heads ostrich-like into
 what sheltering Fallacy is nearest: and wait there, _à
 posteriori._ Readers who saw the Clermontais and Three-Bishopricks gallop, in
 the Night of Spurs; Diligences ruffling up all France into one
 terrific terrified Cock of India; and the Town of Nantes in its
 shirt,—may fancy what an affair to settle this was. Robespierre,
 on the extreme Left, with perhaps Pétion and lean old Goupil, for
 the very Triumvirate has defalcated, are shrieking hoarse;
 drowned in Constitutional clamour. But the debate and arguing of
 a whole Nation; the bellowings through all Journals, for and
 against; the reverberant voice of Danton; the Hyperion-shafts of
 Camille; the porcupine-quills of implacable Marat:—conceive all
 this. Constitutionalists in a body, as we often predicted, do now
 recede from the Mother Society, and become _Feuillans;_
 threatening her with inanition, the rank and respectability being
 mostly gone. Petition after Petition, forwarded by Post, or borne
 in Deputation, comes praying for Judgment and _Déchéance_, which
 is our name for Deposition; praying, at lowest, for Reference to
 the Eighty-three Departments of France. Hot Marseillese
 Deputation comes declaring, among other things: ‘Our Phocean
 Ancestors flung a Bar of Iron into the Bay at their first
 landing; this Bar will float again on the Mediterranean brine
 before we consent to be slaves.’ All this for four weeks or more,
 while the matter still hangs doubtful; Emigration streaming with
 double violence over the frontiers;[399] France seething in
 fierce agitation of this question and prize-question: What is to
 be done with the fugitive Hereditary Representative? Finally, on Friday the 15th of July 1791, the National Assembly
 decides; in what negatory manner we know. Whereupon the Theatres
 all close, the _Bourne_-stones and Portable-chairs begin
 spouting, Municipal Placards flaming on the walls, and
 Proclamations published by sound of trumpet, “invite to repose;”
 with small effect. And so, on Sunday the 17th, there shall be a
 thing seen, worthy of remembering. Scroll of a Petition, drawn up
 by Brissots, Dantons, by Cordeliers, Jacobins; for the thing was
 infinitely shaken and manipulated, and many had a hand in it:
 such Scroll lies now visible, on the wooden framework of the
 Fatherland’s Altar, for signature. Unworking Paris, male and
 female, is crowding thither, all day, to sign or to see. Our fair
 Roland herself the eye of History can discern there, “in the
 morning;”[400] not without interest. In few weeks the fair
 Patriot will quit Paris; yet perhaps only to return. But, what with sorrow of baulked Patriotism, what with closed
 theatres, and Proclamations still publishing themselves by sound
 of trumpet, the fervour of men’s minds, this day, is great. Nay,
 over and above, there has fallen out an incident, of the nature
 of Farce-Tragedy and Riddle; enough to stimulate all creatures.
 Early in the day, a Patriot (or some say, it was a Patriotess,
 and indeed Truth is undiscoverable), while standing on the firm
 deal-board of Fatherland’s Altar, feels suddenly, with
 indescribable torpedo-shock of amazement, his bootsole pricked
 through from below; he clutches up suddenly this electrified
 bootsole and foot; discerns next instant—the point of a gimlet or
 brad-awl playing up, through the firm deal-board, and now hastily
 drawing itself back! Mystery, perhaps Treason? The wooden
 frame-work is impetuously broken up; and behold, verily a
 mystery; never explicable fully to the end of the world! Two
 human individuals, of mean aspect, one of them with a wooden leg,
 lie ensconced there, gimlet in hand: they must have come in
 overnight; they have a supply of provisions,—no “barrel of
 gunpowder” that one can _see;_ they affect to be asleep; look
 blank enough, and give the lamest account of themselves. ‘Mere
 curiosity; they were boring up to get an eye-hole; to see,
 perhaps “with lubricity,” whatsoever, from that _new_ point of
 vision, could be seen:’—little that was edifying, one would
 think! But indeed what stupidest thing may not human Dulness,
 Pruriency, Lubricity, Chance and the Devil, choosing Two out of
 Half-a-million idle human heads, tempt them to?[401] Sure enough, the two human individuals with their gimlet are
 there. Ill-starred pair of individuals! For the result of it all
 is that Patriotism, fretting itself, in this state of nervous
 excitability, with hypotheses, suspicions and reports, keeps
 questioning these two distracted human individuals, and again
 questioning them; claps them into the nearest Guardhouse,
 clutches them out again; one hypothetic group snatching them from
 another: till finally, in such extreme state of nervous
 excitability, Patriotism hangs them as spies of Sieur Motier; and
 the life and secret is choked out of them forevermore.
 Forevermore, alas! Or is a day to be looked for when these two
 evidently mean individuals, who are human nevertheless, will
 become Historical Riddles; and, like him of the _Iron Mask_ (also
 a human individual, and evidently nothing more),—have their
 Dissertations? To us this only is certain, that they had a
 gimlet, provisions and a wooden leg; and have died there on the
 Lanterne, as the unluckiest fools might die. And so the signature goes on, in a still more excited manner. And
 Chaumette, for Antiquarians possess the very Paper to this
 hour,[402]—has signed himself “in a flowing saucy hand slightly
 leaned;” and Hébert, detestable _Père Duchesne_, as if “an inked
 spider had dropped on the paper;” Usher Maillard also has signed,
 and many Crosses, which cannot write. And Paris, through its
 thousand avenues, is welling to the Champ-de-Mars and from it, in
 the utmost excitability of humour; central Fatherland’s Altar
 quite heaped with signing Patriots and Patriotesses; the
 Thirty-benches and whole internal Space crowded with onlookers,
 with comers and goers; one regurgitating whirlpool of men and
 women in their Sunday clothes. All which a Constitutional Sieur
 Motier sees; and Bailly, looking into it with his long visage
 made still longer. Auguring no good; perhaps _Déchéance_ and
 Deposition after all! Stop it, ye Constitutional Patriots; fire
 itself is quenchable, yet only quenchable at _first._ Stop it, truly: but how stop it? Have not the first Free People
 of the Universe a right to petition?—Happily, if also unhappily,
 here is one proof of riot: these two human individuals, hanged at
 the Lanterne. Proof, O treacherous Sieur Motier? Were they not
 two human individuals sent thither by thee to be hanged; to be a
 pretext for thy bloody _Drapeau Rouge?_ This question shall many
 a Patriot, one day, ask; and answer affirmatively, strong in
 Preternatural Suspicion. Enough, towards half past seven in the evening, the mere natural
 eye can behold this thing: Sieur Motier, with Municipals in
 scarf, with blue National Patrollotism, rank after rank, to the
 clang of drums; wending resolutely to the Champ-de-Mars; Mayor
 Bailly, with elongated visage, bearing, as in sad duty bound, the
 _Drapeau Rouge._ Howl of angry derision rises in treble and bass
 from a hundred thousand throats, at the sight of Martial Law;
 which nevertheless waving its Red sanguinary Flag, advances
 there, from the Gros-Caillou Entrance; advances, drumming and
 waving, towards Altar of Fatherland. Amid still wilder howls,
 with objurgation, obtestation; with flights of pebbles and mud,
 _saxa et fæces;_ with crackle of a pistol-shot;—finally with
 volley-fire of Patrollotism; levelled muskets; roll of volley on
 volley! Precisely after one year and three days, our sublime
 Federation Field is wetted, in this manner, with French blood. Some “Twelve unfortunately shot,” reports Bailly, counting by
 units; but Patriotism counts by tens and even by hundreds. Not to
 be forgotten, nor forgiven! Patriotism flies, shrieking,
 execrating. Camille ceases Journalising, this day; great Danton
 with Camille and Fréron have taken wing, for their life; Marat
 burrows deep in the Earth, and is silent. Once more Patrollotism
 has triumphed: one other time; but it is the last. This was the Royal Flight to Varennes. Thus was the Throne
 overturned thereby; but thus also was it victoriously set up
 again—on its vertex; and will stand while it can be held.
 BOOK 2.V.
 PARLIAMENT FIRST
 Chapter 2.5.I.
 Grande Acceptation. In the last nights of September, when the autumnal equinox is
 past, and grey September fades into brown October, why are the
 Champs Elysées illuminated; why is Paris dancing, and flinging
 fire-works? They are gala-nights, these last of September; Paris
 may well dance, and the Universe: the Edifice of the Constitution
 is completed! Completed; nay _revised_, to see that there was
 nothing insufficient in it; solemnly proferred to his Majesty;
 solemnly accepted by him, to the sound of cannon-salvoes, on the
 fourteenth of the month. And now by such illumination, jubilee,
 dancing and fire-working, do we joyously handsel the new Social
 Edifice, and first raise heat and reek there, in the name of
 Hope. The Revision, especially with a throne standing on its vertex,
 has been a work of difficulty, of delicacy. In the way of
 propping and buttressing, so indispensable now, something could
 be done; and yet, as is feared, not enough. A repentant Barnave
 Triumvirate, our Rabauts, Duports, Thourets, and indeed all
 Constitutional Deputies did strain every nerve: but the Extreme
 Left was so noisy; the People were so suspicious, clamorous to
 have the work ended: and then the loyal Right Side sat feeble
 petulant all the while, and as it were, pouting and petting;
 unable to help, had they even been willing; the two Hundred and
 Ninety had solemnly made scission, before that: and departed,
 shaking the dust off their feet. To such transcendency of fret,
 and desperate hope that worsening of the bad might the sooner end
 it and bring back the good, had our unfortunate loyal Right Side
 now come![403] However, one finds that this and the other little prop has been
 added, where possibility allowed. Civil-list and Privy-purse were
 from of old well cared for. King’s Constitutional Guard, Eighteen
 hundred loyal men from the Eighty-three Departments, under a
 loyal Duke de Brissac; this, with trustworthy Swiss besides, is
 of itself something. The old loyal Bodyguards are indeed
 dissolved, in name as well as in fact; and gone mostly towards
 Coblentz. But now also those Sansculottic violent Gardes
 Françaises, or Centre Grenadiers, shall have their mittimus: they
 do ere long, in the Journals, not without a hoarse pathos,
 publish their Farewell; “wishing all Aristocrats the graves in
 Paris which to us are denied.”[404] They depart, these first
 Soldiers of the Revolution; they hover very dimly in the distance
 for about another year; till they can be remodelled, new-named,
 and sent to fight the Austrians; and then History beholds them no
 more. A most notable Corps of men; which has its place in
 World-History;—though to us, so is History written, they remain
 mere rubrics of men; nameless; a shaggy Grenadier Mass, crossed
 with buff-belts. And yet might we not ask: What Argonauts, what
 Leonidas’ Spartans had done such a work? Think of their destiny:
 since that May morning, some three years ago, when they,
 unparticipating, trundled off d’Espréménil to the Calypso Isles;
 since that July evening, some two years ago, when they,
 participating and _sacre_ing with knit brows, poured a volley
 into Besenval’s Prince de Lambesc! History waves them her mute
 adieu. So that the Sovereign Power, these Sansculottic Watchdogs, more
 like wolves, being leashed and led away from his Tuileries,
 breathes freer. The Sovereign Power is guarded henceforth by a
 loyal Eighteen hundred,—whom Contrivance, under various pretexts,
 may gradually swell to Six thousand; who will hinder no Journey
 to Saint-Cloud. The sad Varennes business has been soldered up;
 cemented, even in the blood of the Champ-de-Mars, these two
 months and more; and indeed ever since, as formerly, Majesty has
 had its privileges, its “choice of residence,” though, for good
 reasons, the royal mind “prefers continuing in Paris.” Poor royal
 mind, poor Paris; that have to go mumming; enveloped in
 speciosities, in falsehood which knows itself false; and to enact
 mutually your sorrowful farce-tragedy, being bound to it; and on
 the whole, to hope always, in spite of hope! Nay, now that his Majesty has accepted the Constitution, to the
 sound of cannon-salvoes, who would not hope? Our good King was
 misguided but he meant well. Lafayette has moved for an Amnesty,
 for universal forgiving and forgetting of Revolutionary faults;
 and now surely the glorious Revolution cleared of its rubbish, is
 complete! Strange enough, and touching in several ways, the old
 cry of _Vive le Roi_ once more rises round King Louis the
 Hereditary Representative. Their Majesties went to the Opera;
 gave money to the Poor: the Queen herself, now when the
 Constitution is accepted, hears voice of cheering. Bygone shall
 be bygone; the New Era _shall_ begin! To and fro, amid those
 lamp-galaxies of the Elysian Fields, the Royal Carriage slowly
 wends and rolls; every where with _vivats_, from a multitude
 striving to be glad. Louis looks out, mainly on the variegated
 lamps and gay human groups, with satisfaction enough for the
 hour. In her Majesty’s face, “under that kind graceful smile a
 deep sadness is legible.”[405] Brilliancies, of valour and of
 wit, stroll here observant: a Dame de Staël, leaning most
 probably on the arm of her Narbonne. She meets Deputies; who have
 built this Constitution; who saunter here with vague
 communings,—not without thoughts whether it will stand. But as
 yet melodious fiddlestrings twang and warble every where, with
 the rhythm of light fantastic feet; long lamp-galaxies fling
 their coloured radiance; and brass-lunged Hawkers elbow and bawl,
 ‘_Grande Acceptation, Constitution Monarchique:_’ it behoves the
 Son of Adam to hope. Have not Lafayette, Barnave, and all
 Constitutionalists set their shoulders handsomely to the inverted
 pyramid of a throne? Feuillans, including almost the whole
 Constitutional Respectability of France, perorate nightly from
 their tribune; correspond through all Post-offices; denouncing
 unquiet Jacobinism; trusting well that _its_ time is nigh done.
 Much is uncertain, questionable: but if the Hereditary
 Representative be wise and lucky, may one not, with a sanguine
 Gaelic temper, hope that he will get in motion better or worse;
 that what is wanting to him will gradually be gained and added?');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' For the rest, as we must repeat, in this building of the
 Constitutional Fabric, especially in this Revision of it, nothing
 that one could think of to give it new strength, especially to
 steady it, to give it permanence, and even eternity, has been
 forgotten. Biennial Parliament, to be called Legislative,
 _Assemblée Legislative;_ with Seven Hundred and Forty-five
 Members, chosen in a judicious manner by the “active citizens”
 alone, and even by electing of electors still more active: this,
 with privileges of Parliament shall meet, self-authorized if need
 be, and self-dissolved; shall grant money-supplies and talk;
 watch over the administration and authorities; discharge for ever
 the functions of a Constitutional Great Council, Collective
 Wisdom, and National Palaver,—as the Heavens will enable. Our
 First biennial Parliament, which indeed has been a-choosing since
 early in August, is now as good as chosen. Nay it has mostly got
 to Paris: it arrived gradually;—not without pathetic greeting to
 its venerable Parent, the now moribund Constituent; and sat there
 in the Galleries, reverently listening; ready to begin, the
 instant the ground were clear. Then as to changes in the Constitution itself? This, impossible
 for any Legislative, or common biennial Parliament, and possible
 solely for some resuscitated Constituent or National
 Convention,—is evidently one of the most ticklish points. The
 august moribund Assembly debated it for four entire days. Some
 thought a change, or at least reviewal and new approval, might be
 admissible in thirty years; some even went lower, down to twenty,
 nay to fifteen. The august Assembly had once decided for thirty
 years; but it revoked that, on better thoughts; and did not fix
 any date of time, but merely some vague outline of a posture of
 circumstances, and on the whole left the matter hanging.[406]
 Doubtless a National Convention can be assembled even _within_
 the thirty years: yet one may hope, not; but that Legislatives,
 biennial Parliaments of the common kind, with their limited
 faculty, and perhaps quiet successive additions thereto, may
 suffice, for generations, or indeed while computed Time runs. Furthermore, be it noted that no member of this Constituent has
 been, or could be, elected to the new Legislative. So
 noble-minded were these Law-makers! cry some: and Solon-like
 would banish themselves. So splenetic! cry more: each grudging
 the other, none daring to be outdone in self-denial by the other.
 So unwise in either case! answer all practical men. But consider
 this other self-denying ordinance, That none of us can be King’s
 Minister, or accept the smallest Court Appointment, for the space
 of four, or at lowest (and on long debate and Revision), for the
 space of two years! So moves the incorruptible seagreen
 Robespierre; with cheap magnanimity he; and none dare be outdone
 by him. It was such a law, not so superfluous _then_, that sent
 Mirabeau to the Gardens of Saint-Cloud, under cloak of darkness,
 to that colloquy of the gods; and thwarted many things. Happily
 and unhappily there is no Mirabeau now to thwart. Welcomer meanwhile, welcome surely to all right hearts, is
 Lafayette’s chivalrous Amnesty. Welcome too is that hard-wrung
 Union of Avignon; which has cost us, first and last, “thirty
 sessions of debate,” and so much else: may it at length prove
 lucky! Rousseau’s statue is decreed: virtuous Jean-Jacques,
 Evangelist of the Contrat Social. Not Drouet of Varennes; nor
 worthy Lataille, master of the old world-famous Tennis Court in
 Versailles, is forgotten; but each has his honourable mention,
 and due reward in money.[407] Whereupon, things being all so
 neatly winded up, and the Deputations, and Messages, and royal
 and other Ceremonials having rustled by; and the King having now
 affectionately perorated about peace and tranquilisation, and
 members having answered ‘_Oui! oui!_’ with effusion, even with
 tears,—President Thouret, he of the Law Reforms, rises, and, with
 a strong voice, utters these memorable last-words: ‘The National
 Constituent Assembly declares that it has finished its mission;
 and that its sittings are all ended.’ Incorruptible Robespierre,
 virtuous Pétion are borne home on the shoulders of the people;
 with vivats heaven-high. The rest glide quietly to their
 respective places of abode. It is the last afternoon of
 September, 1791; on the morrow morning the new Legislative will
 begin. So, amid glitter of illuminated streets and Champs Elysées, and
 crackle of fireworks and glad deray, has the first National
 Assembly vanished; _dissolving_, as they well say, into blank
 Time; and is no more. National Assembly is gone, its work
 remaining; as all Bodies of men go, and as man himself goes: it
 had its beginning, and must likewise have its end. A
 Phantasm-Reality born of Time, as the rest of us are; flitting
 ever backwards now on the tide of Time: to be long remembered of
 men. Very strange Assemblages, Sanhedrims, Amphictyonics, Trades
 Unions, Ecumenic Councils, Parliaments and Congresses, have met
 together on this Planet, and dispersed again; but a stranger
 Assemblage than this august Constituent, or with a stranger
 mission, perhaps never met there. Seen from the distance, this
 also will be a miracle. Twelve Hundred human individuals, with
 the Gospel of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in their pocket, congregating
 in the name of Twenty-five Millions, with full assurance of
 faith, to “make the Constitution:” such sight, the acme and main
 product of the Eighteenth Century, our World can witness once
 only. For Time is rich in wonders, in monstrosities most rich;
 and is observed never to repeat himself, or any of his
 Gospels:—surely least of all, this Gospel according to
 Jean-Jacques. Once it was right and indispensable, since such had
 become the Belief of men; but once also is enough. They have made the Constitution, these Twelve Hundred
 Jean-Jacques Evangelists; not without result. Near twenty-nine
 months they sat, with various fortune; in various
 capacity;—always, we may say, in that capacity of carborne
 Caroccio, and miraculous Standard of the Revolt of Men, as a
 Thing high and lifted up; whereon whosoever looked might hope
 healing. They have seen much: cannons levelled on them; then
 suddenly, by interposition of the Powers, the cannons drawn back;
 and a war-god Broglie vanishing, in thunder _not_ his own, amid
 the dust and downrushing of a Bastille and Old Feudal France.
 They have suffered somewhat: Royal Session, with rain and Oath of
 the Tennis-Court; Nights of Pentecost; Insurrections of Women.
 Also have they not done somewhat? Made the Constitution, and
 managed all things the while; passed, in these twenty-nine
 months, “twenty-five hundred Decrees,” which on the average is
 some three for each day, including Sundays! Brevity, one finds,
 is possible, at times: had not Moreau de St. Mery to give three
 thousand orders before rising from his seat?—There was valour (or
 value) in these men; and a kind of faith,—were it only faith in
 this, That cobwebs are not cloth; that a Constitution could be
 made. Cobwebs and chimeras ought verily to disappear; for _a_
 Reality there is. Let formulas, soul-killing, and now grown
 body-killing, insupportable, begone, in the name of Heaven and
 Earth!—Time, as we say, brought forth these Twelve Hundred;
 Eternity was before them, Eternity behind: they worked, as we all
 do, in the confluence of Two Eternities; what work was given
 them. Say not that it was nothing they did. Consciously they did
 somewhat; unconsciously how much! They had their giants and their
 dwarfs, they accomplished their good and their evil; they are
 gone, and return no more. Shall they not go with our blessing, in
 these circumstances; with our mild farewell? By post, by diligence, on saddle or sole; they are gone: towards
 the four winds! Not a few over the marches, to rank at Coblentz.
 Thither wended Maury, among others; but in the end towards
 Rome,—to be clothed there in red Cardinal plush; in falsehood as
 in a garment; pet son (her _last_-born?) of the Scarlet Woman.
 Talleyrand-Perigord, excommunicated Constitutional Bishop, will
 make his way to London; to be Ambassador, spite of the
 Self-denying Law; brisk young Marquis Chauvelin acting as
 Ambassador’s-Cloak. In London too, one finds Pétion the virtuous;
 harangued and haranguing, pledging the wine-cup with
 Constitutional Reform Clubs, in solemn tavern-dinner.
 Incorruptible Robespierre retires for a little to native Arras:
 seven short weeks of quiet; the last appointed him in this world.
 Public Accuser in the Paris Department, acknowledged highpriest
 of the Jacobins; the glass of incorruptible thin Patriotism, for
 his narrow emphasis is loved of all the narrow,—this man seems to
 be rising, somewhither? He sells his small heritage at Arras;
 accompanied by a Brother and a Sister, he returns, scheming out
 with resolute timidity a small sure destiny for himself and them,
 to his old lodging, at the Cabinet-maker’s, in the Rue St.
 Honoré:—O resolute-tremulous incorruptible seagreen man, towards
 _what_ a destiny! Lafayette, for his part, will lay down the command. He retires
 Cincinnatus-like to his hearth and farm; but soon leaves them
 again. Our National Guard, however, shall henceforth have no one
 Commandant; but all Colonels shall command in succession, month
 about. Other Deputies we have met, or Dame de Staël has met,
 “sauntering in a thoughtful manner;” perhaps uncertain what to
 do. Some, as Barnave, the Lameths, and their Duport, will
 continue here in Paris: watching the new biennial Legislative,
 Parliament the First; teaching it to walk, if so might be; and
 the Court to lead it. Thus these: sauntering in a thoughtful manner; travelling by post
 or diligence,—whither Fate beckons. Giant Mirabeau slumbers in
 the Pantheon of Great Men: and France? and Europe?—The
 brass-lunged Hawkers sing ‘Grand Acceptation, Monarchic
 Constitution’ through these gay crowds: the Morrow, grandson of
 Yesterday, must be what it can, as Today its father is. Our new
 biennial Legislative begins to constitute itself on the first of
 October, 1791.
 Chapter 2.5.II.
 The Book of the Law. If the august Constituent Assembly itself, fixing the regards of
 the Universe, could, at the present distance of time and place,
 gain comparatively small attention from us, how much less can
 this poor Legislative! It has its Right Side and its Left; the
 less Patriotic and the more, for Aristocrats exist not here or
 now: it spouts and speaks: listens to Reports, reads Bills and
 Laws; works in its vocation, for a season: but the history of
 France, one finds, is seldom or never there. Unhappy Legislative,
 what can History do with it; if not drop a tear over it, almost
 in silence? First of the two-year Parliaments of France, which,
 if Paper Constitution and oft-repeated National Oath could avail
 aught, were to follow in softly-strong indissoluble sequence
 while Time ran,—it had to vanish dolefully within one year; and
 there came no second like it. Alas! your biennial Parliaments in
 endless indissoluble sequence; they, and all that Constitutional
 Fabric, built with such explosive Federation Oaths, and its
 top-stone brought out with dancing and variegated radiance, went
 to pieces, like frail crockery, in the crash of things; and
 already, in eleven short months, were in that Limbo near the
 Moon, with the ghosts of other Chimeras. There, except for rare
 specific purposes, let them rest, in melancholy peace. On the whole, how unknown is a man to himself; or a public Body
 of men to itself! Æsop’s fly sat on the chariot-wheel,
 exclaiming, What a dust I do raise! Great Governors, clad in
 purple with fasces and insignia, are governed by their valets, by
 the pouting of their women and children; or, in Constitutional
 countries, by the paragraphs of their Able Editors. Say not, I am
 this or that; I am doing this or that! For thou knowest _it_ not,
 thou knowest only the name it as yet goes by. A purple
 Nebuchadnezzar rejoices to feel himself now verily Emperor of
 this great Babylon which he has builded; and _is_ a nondescript
 biped-quadruped, on the eve of a seven-years course of grazing!
 These Seven Hundred and Forty-five elected individuals doubt not
 but they are the First biennial Parliament, come to govern France
 by parliamentary eloquence: and they _are_ what? And they have
 come to do what? Things foolish and not wise! It is much lamented by many that this First Biennial had no
 members of the old Constituent in it, with their experience of
 parties and parliamentary tactics; that such was their foolish
 Self-denying Law. Most surely, old members of the Constituent had
 been welcome to us here. But, on the other hand, what old or what
 new members of any Constituent under the Sun could have
 effectually profited? There are First biennial Parliaments so
 postured as to be, in a sense, _beyond_ wisdom; where wisdom and
 folly differ only in degree, and wreckage and dissolution are the
 appointed issue for both. Old-Constituents, your Barnaves, Lameths and the like, for whom a
 special Gallery has been set apart, where they may sit in honour
 and listen, are in the habit of sneering at these new
 Legislators;[408] but let not us! The poor Seven Hundred and
 Forty-five, sent together by the active citizens of France, are
 what they could be; do what is fated them. That they are of
 Patriot temper we can well understand. Aristocrat Noblesse had
 fled over the marches, or sat brooding silent in their unburnt
 Châteaus; small prospect had they in Primary Electoral
 Assemblies. What with Flights to Varennes, what with Days of
 Poniards, with plot after plot, the People are left to
 themselves; the People must needs choose Defenders of the People,
 such as can be had. Choosing, as _they_ also will ever do, “if
 not the ablest man, yet the man ablest to be chosen!” Fervour of
 character, decided Patriot-Constitutional feeling; these are
 qualities: but free utterance, mastership in tongue-fence; this
 is the quality of qualities. Accordingly one finds, with little
 astonishment, in this First Biennial, that as many as Four
 hundred Members are of the Advocate or Attorney species. Men who
 can speak, if there be aught to speak: nay here are men also who
 can think, and even act. Candour will say of this ill-fated First
 French Parliament that it wanted not its modicum of talent, its
 modicum of honesty; that it, neither in the one respect nor in
 the other, sank below the average of Parliaments, but rose above
 the average. Let average Parliaments, whom the world does _not_
 guillotine, and cast forth to long infamy, be thankful not to
 themselves but to their stars! France, as we say, has once more done what it could: fervid men
 have come together from wide separation; for strange issues.
 Fiery Max Isnard is come, from the utmost South-East; fiery
 Claude Fauchet, Te-Deum Fauchet Bishop of Calvados, from the
 utmost North-West. No Mirabeau now sits here, who had swallowed
 formulas: our only Mirabeau now is Danton, working as yet out of
 doors; whom some call “Mirabeau of the Sansculottes.” Nevertheless we have our gifts,—especially of speech and logic.
 An eloquent Vergniaud we have; most mellifluous yet most
 impetuous of public speakers; from the region named Gironde, of
 the Garonne: a man unfortunately of indolent habits; who will sit
 playing with your children, when he ought to be scheming and
 perorating. Sharp bustling Guadet; considerate grave Censonne;
 kind-sparkling mirthful young Ducos; Valazé doomed to a sad end:
 all these likewise are of that Gironde, or Bourdeaux region: men
 of fervid Constitutional principles; of quick talent,
 irrefragable logic, clear respectability; who will have the Reign
 of Liberty establish itself, but only by respectable methods.
 Round whom others of like temper will gather; known by and by as
 _Girondins_, to the sorrowing wonder of the world. Of which sort
 note Condorcet, Marquis and Philosopher; who has worked at much,
 at Paris Municipal Constitution, Differential Calculus, Newspaper
 _Chronique de Paris_, Biography, Philosophy; and now sits here as
 two-years Senator: a notable Condorcet, with stoical Roman face,
 and fiery heart; “volcano hid under snow;” styled likewise, in
 irreverent language, “_mouton enragé_,” peaceablest of creatures
 bitten rabid! Or note, lastly, Jean-Pierre Brissot; whom Destiny,
 long working noisily with him, has hurled hither, say, to have
 done with him. A biennial Senator he too; nay, for the present,
 the king of such. Restless, scheming, scribbling Brissot; who
 took to himself the style _de Warville_, heralds know not in the
 least why;—unless it were that the father of him did, in an
 unexceptionable manner, perform Cookery and Vintnery in the
 Village of _Ouar_ville? A man of the windmill species, that
 grinds always, turning towards all winds; not in the steadiest
 manner. In all these men there is talent, faculty to work; and they will
 do it: working and shaping, not _without_ effect, though alas not
 in marble, only in quicksand!—But the highest faculty of them all
 remains yet to be mentioned; or indeed has yet to unfold itself
 for mention: Captain Hippolyte Carnot, sent hither from the Pas
 de Calais; with his cold mathematical head, and silent
 stubbornness of will: iron Carnot, far-planning, imperturbable,
 unconquerable; who, in the hour of need, shall not be found
 wanting. His hair is yet black; and it shall grow grey, under
 many kinds of fortune, bright and troublous; and with iron aspect
 this man shall face them all. Nor is _Côté Droit_, and band of King’s friends, wanting:
 Vaublanc, Dumas, Jaucourt the honoured Chevalier; who love
 Liberty, yet with Monarchy over it; and speak fearlessly
 according to that faith;—whom the thick-coming hurricanes will
 sweep away. With them, let a new military Theodore Lameth be
 named;—were it only for his two Brothers’ sake, who look down on
 him, approvingly there, from the Old-Constituents’ Gallery.
 Frothy professing Pastorets, honey-mouthed conciliatory
 Lamourettes, and speechless nameless individuals sit plentiful,
 as Moderates, in the middle. Still less is a _Côté Gauche_
 wanting: extreme Left; sitting on the topmost benches, as if
 aloft on its speculatory Height or _Mountain_, which will become
 a practical fulminatory Height, and make the name of Mountain
 famous-infamous to all times and lands. Honour waits not on this Mountain; nor as yet even loud
 dishonour. Gifts it boasts not, nor graces, of speaking or of
 thinking; solely this one gift of assured faith, of audacity that
 will defy the Earth and the Heavens. Foremost here are the
 Cordelier Trio: hot Merlin from Thionville, hot Bazire, Attorneys
 both; Chabot, disfrocked Capuchin, skilful in agio. Lawyer
 Lacroix, who wore once as subaltern the single epaulette, has
 loud lungs and a hungry heart. There too is Couthon, little
 dreaming _what_ he is;—whom a sad chance has paralysed in the
 lower extremities. For, it seems, he sat once a whole night, not
 warm in his true love’s bower (who indeed was by law another’s),
 but sunken to the middle in a cold peat-bog, being hunted out;
 quaking for his life, in the cold quaking morass;[409] and goes
 now on crutches to the end. Cambon likewise, in whom slumbers
 undeveloped such a finance-talent for printing of Assignats;
 Father of Paper-money; who, in the hour of menace, shall utter
 this stern sentence, “War to the Manorhouse, peace to the Hut,
 _Guerre aux Châteaux, paix aux Chaumières!_”[410] Lecointre, the
 intrepid Draper of Versailles, is welcome here; known since the
 Opera-Repast and Insurrection of Women. Thuriot too; Elector
 Thuriot, who stood in the embrasures of the Bastille, and saw
 Saint-Antoine rising in mass; who has many other things to see.
 Last and grimmest of all note old Ruhl, with his brown dusky face
 and long white hair; of Alsatian Lutheran breed; a man whom age
 and book-learning have not taught; who, haranguing the old men of
 Rheims, shall hold up the Sacred _Ampulla_ (Heaven-sent,
 wherefrom Clovis and all Kings have been anointed) as a mere
 worthless oil-bottle, and dash it to sherds on the pavement
 there; who, alas, shall dash much to sherds, and finally his own
 wild head, by pistol-shot, and so end it. Such lava welters redhot in the bowels of this Mountain; unknown
 to the world and to itself! A mere commonplace Mountain hitherto;
 distinguished from the Plain chiefly by its superior
 _barrenness_, its baldness of look: at the utmost it may, to the
 most observant, perceptibly _smoke_. For as yet all lies so
 solid, peaceable; and doubts not, as was said, that it will
 endure while Time runs. Do not all love Liberty and the
 Constitution? All heartily;—and yet with degrees. Some, as
 Chevalier Jaucourt and his Right Side, may love Liberty less than
 Royalty, were the trial made; others, as Brissot and his Left
 Side, may love it more than Royalty. Nay again of these latter
 some may love Liberty more than Law itself; others not more.
 Parties _will_ unfold themselves; no mortal as yet knows how.
 Forces work within these men and without: dissidence grows
 opposition; ever widening; waxing into incompatibility and
 internecine feud: till the strong is abolished by a stronger;
 himself in his turn by a strongest! Who can help it? Jaucourt and
 his Monarchists, Feuillans, or Moderates; Brissot and his
 Brissotins, Jacobins, or Girondins; these, with the Cordelier
 Trio, and all men, must work what is appointed them, and in the
 way appointed them. And to think what fate these poor Seven Hundred and Forty-five
 are assembled, most unwittingly, to meet! Let no heart be so hard
 as not to pity them. Their soul’s wish was to live and work as
 the First of the French Parliaments: and make the Constitution
 march. Did they not, at their very instalment, go through the
 most affecting Constitutional ceremony, almost with tears? The
 Twelve Eldest are sent solemnly to fetch the Constitution itself,
 the printed book of the Law. Archivist Camus, an Old-Constituent
 appointed Archivist, he and the Ancient Twelve, amid blare of
 military pomp and clangour, enter, bearing the divine Book: and
 President and all Legislative Senators, laying their hand on the
 same, successively take the Oath, with cheers and heart-effusion,
 universal three-times-three.[411] In this manner they begin their
 Session. Unhappy mortals! For, that same day, his Majesty having
 received their Deputation of welcome, as seemed, rather drily,
 the Deputation cannot but feel slighted, cannot but lament such
 slight: and thereupon our cheering swearing First Parliament sees
 itself, on the morrow, obliged to explode into fierce retaliatory
 sputter, of anti-royal Enactment as to how they, for their part,
 will receive Majesty; and how Majesty shall not be called Sire
 any more, except they please: and then, on the following day, to
 recall this Enactment of theirs, as too hasty, and a mere sputter
 though not unprovoked. An effervescent well-intentioned set of Senators; too
 combustible, where continual sparks are flying! Their History is
 a series of sputters and quarrels; true desire to do their
 function, fatal impossibility to do it. Denunciations,
 reprimandings of King’s Ministers, of traitors supposed and real;
 hot rage and fulmination against fulminating Emigrants; terror of
 Austrian Kaiser, of “Austrian Committee” in the Tuileries itself:
 rage and haunting terror, haste and dim desperate
 bewilderment!—Haste, we say; and yet the Constitution had
 provided against haste. No Bill can be passed till it have been
 printed, till it have been thrice read, with intervals of eight
 days;—“unless the Assembly shall beforehand decree that there is
 urgency.” Which, accordingly, the Assembly, scrupulous of the
 Constitution, never omits to do: Considering this, and also
 considering that, and then that other, the Assembly decrees
 always “_qu’il y a urgence;_” and thereupon “the Assembly, having
 decreed that there is urgence,” is free to decree—what
 indispensable distracted thing seems best to it. Two thousand and
 odd decrees, as men reckon, within Eleven months![412] The haste
 of the Constituent seemed great; but this is treble-quick. For
 the time itself is rushing treble-quick; and they have to keep
 pace with that. Unhappy Seven Hundred and Forty-five:
 true-patriotic, but so combustible; being fired, they must needs
 fling fire: Senate of touchwood and rockets, in a world of
 smoke-storm, with sparks wind-driven continually flying! Or think, on the other hand, looking forward some months, of that
 scene they call _Baiser de Lamourette!_ The dangers of the
 country are now grown imminent, immeasurable; National Assembly,
 hope of France, is divided against itself. In such extreme
 circumstances, honey-mouthed Abbé Lamourette, new Bishop of
 Lyons, rises, whose name, _l’amourette_, signifies the
 _sweetheart_, or Delilah doxy,—he rises, and, with pathetic
 honied eloquence, calls on all august Senators to forget mutual
 griefs and grudges, to swear a new oath, and unite as brothers.
 Whereupon they all, with vivats, embrace and swear; Left Side
 confounding itself with Right; barren Mountain rushing down to
 fruitful Plain, Pastoret into the arms of Condorcet, injured to
 the breast of injurer, with tears; and all swearing that
 whosoever wishes either Feuillant Two-Chamber Monarchy or
 Extreme-Jacobin Republic, or any thing but the Constitution and
 that only, shall be anathema maranatha.[413] Touching to behold!
 For, literally on the morrow morning, they must again quarrel,
 driven by Fate; and their sublime reconcilement is called
 derisively _Baiser de L’amourette_, or Delilah Kiss. Like fated Eteocles-Polynices Brothers, embracing, though in
 vain; weeping that they must not love, that they must hate only,
 and die by each other’s hands! Or say, like doomed Familiar
 Spirits; ordered, by Art Magic under penalties, to do a harder
 than twist ropes of sand: “to make the Constitution march.” If
 the Constitution would but march! Alas, the Constitution will not
 stir. It falls on its face; they tremblingly lift it on end
 again: march, thou gold Constitution! The Constitution will not
 march.—‘He shall march, by—!’ said kind Uncle Toby, and even
 swore. The Corporal answered mournfully: ‘He will never march in
 this world.’ A constitution, as we often say, will march when it images, if
 not the old Habits and Beliefs of the Constituted; then
 accurately their Rights, or better indeed, their Mights;—for
 these two, well-understood, are they not one and the same? The
 old Habits of France are gone: her new Rights and Mights are not
 yet ascertained, except in Paper-theorem; nor can be, in any
 sort, till she have _tried_. Till she have measured herself, in
 fell death-grip, and were it in utmost preternatural spasm of
 madness, with Principalities and Powers, with the upper and the
 under, internal and external; with the Earth and Tophet and the
 very Heaven! Then will she know.—Three things bode ill for the
 marching of this French Constitution: the French People; the
 French King; thirdly the French Noblesse and an assembled
 European World.
 Chapter 2.5.III.
 Avignon. But quitting generalities, what strange Fact is this, in the far
 South-West, towards which the eyes of all men do now, in the end
 of October, bend themselves? A tragical combustion, long smoking
 and smouldering unluminous, has now burst into flame there. Hot is that Southern Provençal blood: alas, collisions, as was
 once said, must occur in a career of Freedom; different
 directions will produce such; nay different _velocities_ in the
 same direction will! To much that went on there History, busied
 elsewhere, would not specially give heed: to troubles of Uzez,
 troubles of Nismes, Protestant and Catholic, Patriot and
 Aristocrat; to troubles of Marseilles, Montpelier, Arles; to
 Aristocrat Camp of Jalès, that wondrous real-imaginary Entity,
 now fading pale-dim, then always again glowing forth deep-hued
 (in the Imagination mainly);—ominous magical, “an Aristocrat
 _picture_ of war done naturally!” All this was a tragical deadly
 combustion, with plot and riot, tumult by night and by day; but a
 _dark_ combustion, not luminous, not noticed; which now, however,
 one cannot help noticing. Above all places, the unluminous combustion in Avignon and the
 Comtat Venaissin was fierce. Papal Avignon, with its Castle
 rising sheer over the Rhone-stream; beautifullest Town, with its
 purple vines and gold-orange groves: why must foolish old rhyming
 Réné, the last Sovereign of Provence, bequeath it to the Pope and
 Gold Tiara, not rather to Louis Eleventh with the Leaden Virgin
 in his hatband? For good and for evil! Popes, Anti-popes, with
 their pomp, have dwelt in that Castle of Avignon rising sheer
 over the Rhone-stream: there Laura de Sade went to hear mass; her
 Petrarch twanging and singing by the Fountain of Vaucluse hard
 by, surely in a most melancholy manner. This was in the old days. And now in these new days, such issues do come from a squirt of
 the pen by some foolish rhyming Réné, after centuries, this is
 what we have: Jourdan _Coupe-tête_, leading to siege and warfare
 an Army, from three to fifteen thousand strong, called the
 Brigands of Avignon; which title they themselves accept, with the
 addition of an epithet, “The _brave_ Brigands of Avignon!” It is
 even so. Jourdan the Headsman fled hither from that Chatelet
 Inquest, from that Insurrection of Women; and began dealing in
 madder; but the scene was rife in other than dye-stuffs; so
 Jourdan shut his madder shop, and has risen, for he was the man
 to do it. The tile-beard of Jourdan is shaven off; his fat visage
 has got coppered and studded with black carbuncles; the Silenus
 trunk is swollen with drink and high living: he wears blue
 National uniform with epaulettes, “an enormous sabre, two
 horse-pistols crossed in his belt, and other two smaller,
 sticking from his pockets;” styles himself General, and is the
 tyrant of men.[414] Consider this one fact, O Reader; and what
 sort of facts must have preceded it, must accompany it! Such
 things come of old Réné; and of the question which has risen,
 Whether Avignon cannot now cease wholly to be Papal and become
 French and free? For some twenty-five months the confusion has lasted. Say three
 months of arguing; then seven of raging; then finally some
 fifteen months now of fighting, and even of hanging. For already
 in February 1790, the Papal Aristocrats had set up four gibbets,
 for a sign; but the People rose in June, in retributive frenzy;
 and, forcing the public Hangman to act, hanged four Aristocrats,
 on each Papal gibbet a Papal Haman. Then were Avignon
 Emigrations, Papal Aristocrats emigrating over the Rhone River;
 demission of Papal Consul, flight, victory: re-entrance of Papal
 Legate, truce, and new onslaught; and the various turns of war.
 Petitions there were to National Assembly; Congresses of
 Townships; three-score and odd Townships voting for French
 Reunion, and the blessings of Liberty; while some twelve of the
 smaller, manipulated by Aristocrats, gave vote the other way:
 with shrieks and discord! Township against Township, Town against
 Town: Carpentras, long jealous of Avignon, is now turned out in
 open war with it;—and Jourdan _Coupe-tête_, your first General
 being killed in mutiny, closes his dye-shop; and does there
 visibly, with siege-artillery, above all with bluster and tumult,
 with the “brave Brigands of Avignon,” beleaguer the rival Town,
 for two months, in the face of the world!');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Feats were done, doubt it not, far-famed in Parish History; but
 to Universal History unknown. Gibbets we see rise, on the one
 side and on the other; and wretched carcasses swinging there, a
 dozen in the row; wretched Mayor of Vaison buried before
 dead.[415] The fruitful seedfield, lie unreaped, the vineyards
 trampled down; there is red cruelty, madness of universal choler
 and gall. Havoc and anarchy everywhere; a combustion most fierce,
 but _un_lucent, not to be noticed here!—Finally, as we saw, on
 the 14th of September last, the National Constituent Assembly,
 having sent Commissioners and heard them;[416] having heard
 Petitions, held Debates, month after month ever since August
 1789; and on the whole “spent thirty sittings” on this matter,
 did solemnly decree that Avignon and the Comtat were incorporated
 with France, and His Holiness the Pope should have what indemnity
 was reasonable. And so hereby all is amnestied and finished? Alas, when madness
 of choler has gone through the blood of men, and gibbets have
 swung on this side and on that, what will a parchment Decree and
 Lafayette Amnesty do? Oblivious Lethe flows not _above_ ground!
 Papal Aristocrats and Patriot Brigands are still an eye-sorrow to
 each other; suspected, suspicious, in what they do and forbear.
 The august Constituent Assembly is gone but a fortnight, when, on
 Sunday the Sixteenth morning of October 1791, the unquenched
 combustion suddenly becomes luminous! For Anti-constitutional
 Placards are up, and the Statue of the Virgin is said to have
 shed tears, and grown red.[417] Wherefore, on that morning,
 Patriot l’Escuyer, one of our “six leading Patriots,” having
 taken counsel with his brethren and General Jourdan, determines
 on going to Church, in company with a friend or two: not to hear
 mass, which he values little; but to meet all the Papalists there
 in a body, nay to meet that same weeping Virgin, for it is the
 Cordeliers Church; and give them a word of admonition.
 Adventurous errand; which has the fatallest issue! What
 L’Escuyer’s word of admonition might be no History records; but
 the answer to it was a shrieking howl from the Aristocrat Papal
 worshippers, many of them women. A thousand-voiced shriek and
 menace; which as L’Escuyer did not fly, became a thousand-handed
 hustle and jostle; a thousand-footed kick, with tumblings and
 tramplings, with the pricking of semstresses stilettos, scissors,
 and female pointed instruments. Horrible to behold; the ancient
 Dead, and Petrarchan Laura, sleeping round it there;[418] high
 Altar and burning tapers looking down on it; the Virgin quite
 tearless, and of the natural stone-colour!—L’Escuyer’s friend or
 two rush off, like Job’s Messengers, for Jourdan and the National
 Force. But heavy Jourdan will seize the Town-Gates first; does
 not run treble-fast, as he might: on arriving at the Cordeliers
 Church, the Church is silent, vacant; L’Escuyer, all alone, lies
 there, swimming in his blood, at the foot of the high Altar;
 pricked with scissors; trodden, massacred;—gives one dumb sob,
 and gasps out his miserable life for evermore. Sight to stir the heart of any man; much more of many men,
 self-styled Brigands of Avignon! The corpse of L’Escuyer,
 stretched on a bier, the ghastly head girt with laurel, is borne
 through the streets; with many-voiced unmelodious _Nenia;_
 funeral-wail still deeper than it is loud! The copper-face of
 Jourdan, of bereft Patriotism, has grown black. Patriot
 Municipality despatches official Narrative and tidings to Paris;
 orders numerous or innumerable arrestments for inquest and
 perquisition. Aristocrats male and female are haled to the
 Castle; lie crowded in subterranean dungeons there, bemoaned by
 the hoarse rushing of the Rhone; cut out from help. So lie they; waiting inquest and perquisition. Alas! with a
 Jourdan Headsman for Generalissimo, with his copper-face grown
 black, and armed Brigand Patriots chanting their _Nenia_, the
 inquest is likely to be brief. On the next day and the next, let
 Municipality consent or not, a Brigand Court-Martial establishes
 itself in the subterranean stories of the Castle of Avignon;
 Brigand Executioners, with naked sabre, waiting at the door, for
 a Brigand verdict. Short judgment, no appeal! There is Brigand
 wrath and vengeance; not unrefreshed by brandy. Close by is the
 Dungeon of the _Glacière_, or Ice-Tower: there may be deeds
 done—? For which language has no name!—Darkness and the shadow of
 horrid cruelty envelopes these Castle Dungeons, that _Glacière_
 Tower: clear only that many have entered, that few have returned.
 Jourdan and the Brigands, supreme now over Municipals, over all
 Authorities Patriot or Papal, reign in Avignon, waited on by
 Terror and Silence. The result of all which is that, on the 15th of November 1791, we
 behold Friend Dampmartin, and subalterns beneath him, and General
 Choisi above him, with Infantry and Cavalry, and proper
 cannon-carriages rattling in front, with spread banners, to the
 sound of fife and drum, wend, in a deliberate formidable manner,
 towards that sheer Castle Rock, towards those broad Gates of
 Avignon; three new National-Assembly Commissioners following at
 safe distance in the rear.[419] Avignon, summoned in the name of
 Assembly and Law, flings its Gates wide open; Choisi with the
 rest, Dampmartin and the _Bons Enfans_, “Good Boys of
 _Baufremont_,” so they name these brave Constitutional Dragoons,
 known to them of old,—do enter, amid shouts and scattered
 flowers. To the joy of all honest persons; to the terror only of
 Jourdan Headsman and the Brigands. Nay next we behold carbuncled
 swollen Jourdan himself shew copper-face, with sabre and four
 pistols; affecting to talk high: engaging, meanwhile, to
 surrender the Castle that instant. So the Choisi Grenadiers enter
 with him there. They start and stop, passing that _Glacière_,
 snuffing its horrible breath; with wild yell, with cries of ‘Cut
 the Butcher down!’—and Jourdan has to whisk himself through
 secret passages, and instantaneously vanish. Be the mystery of iniquity laid bare then! A Hundred and Thirty
 Corpses, of men, nay of women and even children (for the
 trembling mother, hastily seized, could not leave her infant),
 lie heaped in that _Glacière;_ putrid, under putridities: the
 horror of the world. For three days there is mournful lifting
 out, and recognition; amid the cries and movements of a
 passionate Southern people, now kneeling in prayer, now storming
 in wild pity and rage: lastly there is solemn sepulture, with
 muffled drums, religious requiem, and all the people’s wail and
 tears. Their Massacred rest now in holy ground; buried in one
 grave. And Jourdan _Coupe-tête?_ Him also we behold again, after a day
 or two: in flight, through the most romantic Petrarchan
 hill-country; vehemently spurring his nag; young Ligonnet, a
 brisk youth of Avignon, with Choisi Dragoons, close in his rear!
 With such swollen mass of a rider no nag can run to advantage.
 The tired nag, spur-driven, does take the River Sorgue; but
 sticks in the middle of it; firm on that _chiaro fondo di Sorga;_
 and will proceed no further for spurring! Young Ligonnet dashes
 up; the Copper-face menaces and bellows, draws pistol, perhaps
 even snaps it; is nevertheless seized by the collar; is tied
 firm, ancles under horse’s belly, and ridden back to Avignon,
 hardly to be saved from massacre on the streets there.[420] Such is the combustion of Avignon and the South-West, when it
 becomes luminous! Long loud debate is in the august Legislative,
 in the Mother-Society as to what now shall be done with it.
 Amnesty, cry eloquent Vergniaud and all Patriots: let there be
 mutual pardon and repentance, restoration, pacification, and if
 so might any how be, an end! Which vote ultimately prevails. So
 the South-West smoulders and welters again in an “Amnesty,” or
 Non-remembrance, which alas cannot but remember, no Lethe flowing
 above ground! Jourdan himself remains unchanged; gets loose again
 as one not yet gallows-ripe; nay, as we transciently discern from
 the distance, is “carried in triumph through the cities of the
 South.”[421] What things men carry! With which transient glimpse, of a Copper-faced Portent faring in
 this manner through the cities of the South, we must quit these
 regions;—and let them smoulder. They want not their Aristocrats;
 proud old Nobles, not yet emigrated. Arles has its “_Chiffonne_,”
 so, in symbolical cant, they name that Aristocrat
 Secret-Association; Arles has its pavements piled up, by and by,
 into Aristocrat barricades. Against which Rebecqui, the hot-clear
 Patriot, must lead Marseilles with cannon. The Bar of Iron has
 not yet risen to the top in the Bay of Marseilles; neither have
 these hot Sons of the Phoceans submitted to be slaves. By clear
 management and hot instance, Rebecqui dissipates that
 _Chiffonne_, without bloodshed; restores the pavement of Arles.
 He sails in Coast-barks, this Rebecqui, scrutinising suspicious
 Martello-towers, with the keen eye of Patriotism; marches
 overland with despatch, singly, or in force; to City after City;
 dim scouring far and wide;[422]—argues, and if it must be,
 fights. For there is much to do; Jalès itself is looking
 suspicious. So that Legislator Fauchet, after debate on it, has
 to propose Commissioners and a Camp on the Plain of Beaucaire:
 with or without result. Of all which, and much else, let us note only this small
 consequence, that young Barbaroux, Advocate, Town-Clerk of
 Marseilles, being charged to have these things remedied, arrived
 at Paris in the month of February 1792. The beautiful and brave:
 young Spartan, ripe in energy, not ripe in wisdom; over whose
 black doom there shall flit nevertheless a certain ruddy fervour,
 streaks of bright Southern tint, not wholly swallowed of Death!
 Note also that the Rolands of Lyons are again in Paris; for the
 second and final time. King’s Inspectorship is abrogated at
 Lyons, as elsewhere: Roland has his retiring-pension to claim, if
 attainable; has Patriot friends to commune with; at lowest, has a
 book to publish. That young Barbaroux and the Rolands came
 together; that elderly Spartan Roland liked, or even loved the
 young Spartan, and was loved by him, one can fancy: and Madame—?
 Breathe not, thou poison-breath, Evil-speech! That soul is
 taintless, clear, as the mirror-sea. And yet if they too did look
 into each other’s eyes, and each, in silence, in tragical
 renunciance, did find that the other was all too lovely? _Honi
 soit!_ She calls him “beautiful as Antinous:” he “will speak
 elsewhere of that astonishing woman.”—A Madame d’Udon (or some
 such name, for Dumont does not recollect quite clearly) gives
 copious Breakfast to the Brissotin Deputies and us Friends of
 Freedom, at her house in the Place Vendôme; with temporary
 celebrity, with graces and wreathed smiles; not without cost.
 There, amid wide babble and jingle, our plan of Legislative
 Debate is settled for the day, and much counselling held. Strict
 Roland is seen there, but does not go often.[423]
 Chapter 2.5.IV.
 No Sugar. Such are our inward troubles; seen in the Cities of the South;
 extant, seen or unseen, in all cities and districts, North as
 well as South. For in all are Aristocrats, more or less
 malignant; watched by Patriotism; which again, being of various
 shades, from light Fayettist-Feuillant down to deep-sombre
 Jacobin, has to watch _itself!_ Directories of Departments, what we call County Magistracies,
 being chosen by Citizens of a too “active” class, are found to
 pull one way; Municipalities, Town Magistracies, to pull the
 other way. In all places too are Dissident Priests; whom the
 Legislative will have to deal with: contumacious individuals,
 working on that angriest of passions; plotting, enlisting for
 Coblentz; or suspected of plotting: fuel of a universal
 unconstitutional heat. What to do with them? They may be
 conscientious as well as contumacious: gently they should be
 dealt with, and yet it must be speedily. In unilluminated La
 Vendée the simple are like to be seduced by them; many a simple
 peasant, a Cathelineau the wool-dealer wayfaring meditative with
 his wool-packs, in these hamlets, dubiously shakes his head! Two
 Assembly Commissioners went thither last Autumn; considerate
 Gensonné, not yet called to be a Senator; Gallois, an editorial
 man. These Two, consulting with General Dumouriez, spake and
 worked, softly, with judgment; they have hushed down the
 irritation, and produced a soft Report,—for the time. The General himself doubts not in the least but he can keep peace
 there; being an able man. He passes these frosty months among the
 pleasant people of Niort, occupies “tolerably handsome apartments
 in the Castle of Niort,” and tempers the minds of men.[424] Why
 is there but one Dumouriez? Elsewhere you find South or North,
 nothing but untempered obscure jarring; which breaks forth ever
 and anon into open clangour of riot. Southern Perpignan has its
 tocsin, by torch light; with rushing and onslaught: Northern Caen
 not less, by daylight; with Aristocrats ranged in arms at Places
 of Worship; Departmental compromise proving impossible; breaking
 into musketry and a Plot discovered![425] Add Hunger too: for
 Bread, always dear, is getting dearer: not so much as Sugar can
 be had; for good reasons. Poor Simoneau, Mayor of Etampes, in
 this Northern region, hanging out his Red Flag in some riot of
 grains, is trampled to death by a hungry exasperated People. What
 a trade this of Mayor, in these times! Mayor of Saint-Denis hung
 at the Lanterne, by Suspicion and Dyspepsia, as we saw long
 since; Mayor of Vaison, as we saw lately, buried before dead; and
 now this poor Simoneau, the Tanner, of Etampes,—whom legal
 Constitutionalism will not forget. With factions, suspicions, want of bread and sugar, it is verily
 what they call _déchiré_, torn asunder this poor country: France
 and all that is French. For, over seas too come bad news. In
 black Saint-Domingo, before that variegated Glitter in the Champs
 Elysées was lit for an Accepted Constitution, there had risen,
 and was burning contemporary with it, quite another variegated
 Glitter and nocturnal Fulgor, had we known it: of molasses and
 ardent-spirits; of sugar-boileries, plantations, furniture,
 cattle and men: skyhigh; the Plain of Cap Français one huge whirl
 of smoke and flame! What a change here, in these two years; since that first “Box of
 Tricolor Cockades” got through the Custom-house, and atrabiliar
 Creoles too rejoiced that there was a levelling of Bastilles!
 Levelling is comfortable, as we often say: levelling, yet only
 down to oneself. Your pale-white Creoles, have their
 grievances:—and your yellow Quarteroons? And your dark-yellow
 Mulattoes? And your Slaves soot-black? Quarteroon Ogé, Friend of
 our Parisian Brissotin _Friends of the Blacks_, felt, for his
 share too, that Insurrection was the most sacred of duties. So
 the tricolor Cockades had fluttered and swashed only some three
 months on the Creole hat, when Ogé’s signal-conflagrations went
 aloft; with the voice of rage and terror. Repressed, doomed to
 die, he took black powder or seedgrains in the hollow of his
 hand, this Ogé; sprinkled a film of white ones on the top, and
 said to his Judges, ‘Behold they are white;’—then _shook_ his
 hand, and said ‘Where are the Whites, _Où sont les Blancs?_’ So now, in the Autumn of 1791, looking from the sky-windows of
 Cap Français, thick clouds of smoke girdle our horizon, smoke in
 the day, in the night fire; preceded by fugitive shrieking white
 women, by Terror and Rumour. Black demonised squadrons are
 massacring and harrying, with nameless cruelty. They fight and
 fire “from behind thickets and coverts,” for the Black man loves
 the Bush; they rush to the attack, thousands strong, with
 brandished cutlasses and fusils, with caperings, shoutings and
 vociferation,—which, if the White Volunteer Company stands firm,
 dwindle into staggerings, into quick gabblement, into panic
 flight at the first volley, perhaps before it.[426] Poor Ogé
 could be broken on the wheel; this fire-whirlwind too can be
 abated, driven up into the Mountains: but Saint-Domingo is
 _shaken_, as Ogé’s seedgrains were; shaking, writhing in long
 horrid death-throes, it is Black without remedy; and remains, as
 African Haiti, a monition to the world. O my Parisian Friends, is not _this_, as well as Regraters and
 Feuillant Plotters, one cause of the astonishing dearth of Sugar!
 The Grocer, palpitant, with drooping lip, sees his Sugar _taxé;_
 weighed out by Female Patriotism, in instant retail, at the
 inadequate rate of twenty-five sous, or thirteen pence a pound.
 ‘Abstain from it?’ yes, ye Patriot Sections, all ye Jacobins,
 abstain! Louvet and Collot-d’Herbois so advise; resolute to make
 the sacrifice: though ‘how shall literary men do without coffee?’
 Abstain, with an oath; that is the surest![427] Also, for like reason, must not Brest and the Shipping Interest
 languish? Poor Brest languishes, sorrowing, not without spleen;
 denounces an Aristocrat Bertrand-Moleville traitorous Aristocrat
 Marine-Minister. Do not her Ships and King’s Ships lie rotting
 piecemeal in harbour; Naval Officers mostly fled, and on furlough
 too, with pay? Little stirring there; if it be not the Brest
 Gallies, whip-driven, with their Galley-Slaves,—alas, with some
 Forty of our hapless Swiss Soldiers of Château-Vieux, among
 others! These Forty Swiss, too mindful of Nanci, do now, in their
 red wool caps, tug sorrowfully at the oar; looking into the
 Atlantic brine, which reflects only their own sorrowful shaggy
 faces; and seem forgotten of Hope. But, on the whole, may we not say, in fugitive language, that the
 French Constitution which shall march is very _rheumatic_, full
 of shooting internal pains, in joint and muscle; and will not
 march without difficulty?
 Chapter 2.5.V.
 Kings and Emigrants. Extremely rheumatic Constitutions have been known to march, and
 keep on their feet, though in a staggering sprawling manner, for
 long periods, in virtue of one thing only: that the _Head_ were
 healthy. But this Head of the French Constitution! What King
 Louis is and cannot help being, Readers already know. A King who
 cannot take the Constitution, nor reject the Constitution: nor do
 anything at all, but miserably ask, What shall I do? A King
 environed with endless confusions; in whose own mind is no germ
 of order. Haughty implacable remnants of Noblesse struggling with
 humiliated repentant Barnave-Lameths: struggling in that obscure
 element of fetchers and carriers, of Half-pay braggarts from the
 Café Valois, of Chambermaids, whisperers, and subaltern officious
 persons; fierce Patriotism looking on all the while, more and
 more suspicious, from without: what, in such struggle, can they
 do? At best, _cancel_ one another, and produce _zero_. Poor King!
 Barnave and your Senatorial Jaucourts speak earnestly into this
 ear; Bertrand-Moleville, and Messengers from Coblentz, speak
 earnestly into that: the poor Royal head turns to the one side
 and to the other side; can turn itself fixedly to no side. Let
 Decency drop a veil over it: sorrier misery was seldom enacted in
 the world. This one small fact, does it not throw the saddest
 light on much? The Queen is lamenting to Madam Campan: ‘What am I
 to do? When they, these Barnaves, get us advised to any step
 which the Noblesse do not like, then I am pouted at; nobody comes
 to my card table; the King’s Couchée is solitary.’[428] In such a
 case of dubiety, what _is_ one to do? Go inevitably to the
 ground! The King has accepted this Constitution, knowing beforehand that
 it will not serve: he studies it, and executes it in the hope
 mainly that it will be found inexecutable. King’s Ships lie
 rotting in harbour, their officers gone; the Armies disorganised;
 robbers scour the highways, which wear down unrepaired; all
 Public Service lies slack and waste: the Executive makes no
 effort, or an effort only to throw the blame on the Constitution.
 Shamming death, “_faisant le mort!_” What Constitution, use it in
 this manner, can march? “Grow to disgust the Nation” it will
 truly,[429]—unless _you_ first grow to disgust the Nation! It is
 Bertrand de Moleville’s plan, and his Majesty’s; the best they
 can form. Or if, after all, this best-plan proved too slow; proved a
 failure? Provident of that too, the Queen, shrouded in deepest
 mystery, “writes all day, in cipher, day after day, to Coblentz;”
 Engineer Goguelat, he of the _Night of Spurs_, whom the Lafayette
 Amnesty has delivered from Prison, rides and runs. Now and then,
 on fit occasion, a Royal familiar visit can be paid to that Salle
 de Manége, an affecting encouraging Royal Speech (sincere, doubt
 it not, for the moment) can be delivered there, and the Senators
 all cheer and almost weep;—at the same time Mallet du Pan has
 visibly ceased editing, and invisibly bears abroad a King’s
 Autograph, soliciting help from the Foreign Potentates.[430]
 Unhappy Louis, _do_ this thing or else that other,—if thou
 couldst! The thing which the King’s Government did do was to stagger
 distractedly from contradiction to contradiction; and wedding
 Fire to Water, envelope itself in hissing, and ashy steam! Danton
 and needy corruptible Patriots are sopped with presents of cash:
 they accept the sop: they rise refreshed by it, and travel their
 own way.[431] Nay, the King’s Government did likewise hire
 Hand-clappers, or _claqueurs_, persons to applaud. Subterranean
 Rivarol has Fifteen Hundred men in King’s pay, at the rate of
 some ten thousand pounds sterling per month; what he calls “a
 staff of genius:” Paragraph-writers, Placard-Journalists; “two
 hundred and eighty Applauders, at three shillings a day:” one of
 the strangest Staffs ever commanded by man. The muster-rolls and
 account-books of which still exist.[432] Bertrand-Moleville
 himself, in a way he thinks very dexterous, contrives to pack the
 Galleries of the Legislative; gets Sansculottes hired to go
 thither, and applaud at a signal given, they fancying it was
 Pétion that bid them: a device which was not detected for almost
 a week. Dexterous enough; as if a man finding the Day fast
 decline should determine on altering the Clockhands: _that_ is a
 thing possible for him. Here too let us note an unexpected apparition of Philippe
 d’Orléans at Court: his last at the Levee of any King. D’Orléans,
 sometime in the winter months seemingly, has been appointed to
 that old first-coveted rank of Admiral,—though only over ships
 rotting in port. The wished-for comes too late! However, he waits
 on Bertrand-Moleville to give thanks: nay to state that he would
 willingly thank his Majesty in person; that, in spite of all the
 horrible things men have said and sung, he is far from being his
 Majesty’s enemy; at bottom, how far! Bertrand delivers the
 message, brings about the royal Interview, which does pass to the
 satisfaction of his Majesty; d’Orléans seeming clearly repentant,
 determined to turn over a new leaf. And yet, next Sunday, what do
 we see? “Next Sunday,” says Bertrand, “he came to the King’s
 Levee; but the Courtiers ignorant of what had passed, the crowd
 of Royalists who were accustomed to resort thither on that day
 specially to pay their court, gave him the most humiliating
 reception. They came pressing round him; managing, as if by
 mistake, to tread on his toes, to elbow him towards the door, and
 not let him enter again. He went downstairs to her Majesty’s
 Apartments, where cover was laid; so soon as he shewed face,
 sounds rose on all sides, ‘_Messieurs, take care of the dishes_,’
 as if he had carried poison in his pockets. The insults which his
 presence every where excited forced him to retire without having
 seen the Royal Family: the crowd followed him to the Queen’s
 Staircase; in descending, he received a spitting (_crachat_) on
 the head, and some others, on his clothes. Rage and spite were
 seen visibly painted on his face:”[433] as indeed how could they
 miss to be? He imputes it all to the King and Queen, who know
 nothing of it, who are even much grieved at it; and so descends,
 to his Chaos again. Bertrand was there at the Château that day
 himself, and an eye-witness to these things. For the rest, Non-jurant Priests, and the repression of them,
 will distract the King’s conscience; Emigrant Princes and
 Noblesse will force him to double-dealing: there must be _veto_
 on _veto;_ amid the ever-waxing indignation of men. For
 Patriotism, as we said, looks on from without, more and more
 suspicious. Waxing tempest, blast after blast, of Patriot
 indignation, from without; dim inorganic whirl of Intrigues,
 Fatuities, within! Inorganic, fatuous; from which the eye turns
 away. De Staël intrigues for her so gallant Narbonne, to get him
 made War-Minister; and ceases not, having got him made. The King
 shall fly to Rouen; shall there, with the gallant Narbonne,
 properly “modify the Constitution.” This is the same brisk
 Narbonne, who, last year, cut out from their entanglement, by
 force of dragoons, those poor fugitive Royal Aunts: men say he is
 at bottom their Brother, or even _more_, so scandalous is
 scandal. He drives now, with his de Staël, rapidly to the Armies,
 to the Frontier Towns; produces rose-coloured Reports, not too
 credible; perorates, gesticulates; wavers poising himself on the
 top, for a moment, seen of men; then tumbles, dismissed, washed
 away by the Time-flood. Also the fair Princess de Lamballe intrigues, bosom friend of her
 Majesty: to the angering of Patriotism. Beautiful Unfortunate,
 why did she ever return from England? Her small silver-voice,
 what can it profit in that piping of the black World-tornado?
 Which will whirl _her_, poor fragile Bird of Paradise, against
 grim rocks. Lamballe and de Staël intrigue visibly, apart or
 together: but who shall reckon how many others, and in what
 infinite ways, invisibly! Is there not what one may call an
 “Austrian Committee,” sitting invisible in the Tuileries; centre
 of an invisible Anti-National Spiderweb, which, for we sleep
 among mysteries, stretches its threads to the ends of the Earth?
 Journalist Carra has now the clearest certainty of it: to
 Brissotin Patriotism, and France generally, it is growing more
 and more probable. O Reader, hast thou no pity for this Constitution? Rheumatic
 shooting pains in its members; pressure of hydrocephale and
 hysteric vapours on its Brain: a Constitution divided against
 itself; which will never march, hardly even stagger? Why were not
 Drouet and Procureur Sausse in their beds, that unblessed
 Varennes Night! Why did they not, in the name of Heaven, let the
 Korff Berline go whither it listed! Nameless incoherency,
 incompatibility, perhaps prodigies at which the world still
 shudders, had been spared. But now comes the third thing that bodes ill for the marching of
 this French Constitution: besides the French People, and the
 French King, there is thirdly—the assembled European world? it
 has become necessary now to look at that also. Fair France is so
 luminous: and round and round it, is troublous Cimmerian Night.
 Calonnes, Bréteuils hover dim, far-flown; overnetting Europe with
 intrigues. From Turin to Vienna; to Berlin, and utmost Petersburg
 in the frozen North! Great Burke has raised his great voice long
 ago; eloquently demonstrating that the end of an Epoch is come,
 to all appearance the end of Civilised Time. Him many answer:
 Camille Desmoulins, Clootz Speaker of Mankind, Paine the
 rebellious Needleman, and honourable Gallic Vindicators in that
 country and in this: but the great Burke remains unanswerable;
 “The Age of Chivalry _is_ gone,” and could not but go, having now
 produced the still more indomitable Age of Hunger. Altars enough,
 of the Dubois-Rohan sort, changing to the Gobel-and-Talleyrand
 sort, are faring by rapid transmutation to, shall we say, the
 right Proprietor of them? French Game and French Game-Preservers
 did alight on the Cliffs of Dover, with cries of distress. Who
 will say that the end of much is not come? A set of mortals has
 risen, who believe that Truth is not a printed Speculation, but a
 practical Fact; that Freedom and Brotherhood are possible in this
 Earth, supposed always to be Belial’s, which “the Supreme Quack”
 was to inherit! Who will say that Church, State, Throne, Altar
 are not in danger; that the sacred Strong-box itself, last
 Palladium of effete Humanity, may not be blasphemously blown
 upon, and its padlocks undone? The poor Constituent Assembly might act with what delicacy and
 diplomacy it would; declare that it abjured meddling with its
 neighbours, foreign conquest, and so forth; but from the first
 this thing was to be predicted: that old Europe and new France
 could not subsist _together_. A Glorious Revolution, oversetting
 State-Prisons and Feudalism; publishing, with outburst of
 Federative Cannon, in face of all the Earth, that Appearance is
 not Reality, how shall it subsist amid Governments which, if
 Appearance is _not_ Reality, are—one knows not what? In death
 feud, and internecine wrestle and battle, it shall subsist with
 them; not otherwise. Rights of Man, printed on Cotton Handkerchiefs, in various
 dialects of human speech, pass over to the Frankfort Fair.[434]
 What say we, Frankfort Fair? They have crossed Euphrates and the
 fabulous Hydaspes; wafted themselves beyond the Ural, Altai,
 Himmalayah: struck off from wood stereotypes, in angular
 Picture-writing, they are jabbered and jingled of in China and
 Japan. Where will it stop? Kien-Lung smells mischief; not the
 remotest Dalai-Lama shall now knead his dough-pills in
 peace.—Hateful to us; as is the Night! Bestir yourselves, ye
 Defenders of Order! They do bestir themselves: all Kings and
 Kinglets, with their spiritual temporal array, are astir; their
 brows clouded with menace. Diplomatic emissaries fly swift;
 Conventions, privy Conclaves assemble; and wise wigs wag, taking
 what counsel they can. Also, as we said, the Pamphleteer draws pen, on this side and
 that: zealous fists beat the Pulpit-drum. Not without issue! Did
 not iron Birmingham, shouting “Church and King,” itself knew not
 why, burst out, last July, into rage, drunkenness, and fire; and
 your Priestleys, and the like, dining there on that Bastille day,
 get the maddest singeing: scandalous to consider! In which same
 days, as we can remark, high Potentates, Austrian and Prussian,
 with Emigrants, were faring towards Pilnitz in Saxony; there, on
 the 27th of August, they, keeping to themselves what further
 “secret Treaty” there might or might not be, did publish their
 hopes and their threatenings, their Declaration that it was “the
 common cause of Kings.”');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Where a will to quarrel is, there is a way. Our readers remember
 that Pentecost-Night, Fourth of August 1789, when Feudalism fell
 in a few hours? The National Assembly, in abolishing Feudalism,
 promised that “compensation” should be given; and did endeavour
 to give it. Nevertheless the Austrian Kaiser answers that his
 German Princes, for their part, cannot be unfeudalised; that they
 have Possessions in French Alsace, and Feudal Rights secured to
 them, for which no conceivable compensation will suffice. So this
 of the Possessioned Princes, “_Princes Possessionés_” is bandied
 from Court to Court; covers acres of diplomatic paper at this
 day: a weariness to the world. Kaunitz argues from Vienna;
 Delessart responds from Paris, though perhaps not sharply enough.
 The Kaiser and his Possessioned Princes will too evidently come
 and _take_ compensation—so much as they can get. Nay might one
 not _partition_ France, as we have done Poland, and are doing;
 and so pacify it with a vengeance? From South to North! For actually it is “the common cause of
 Kings.” Swedish Gustav, sworn Knight of the Queen of France, will
 lead Coalised Armies;—had not Ankarstrom treasonously shot him;
 for, indeed, there were griefs nearer home.[435] Austria and
 Prussia speak at Pilnitz; all men intensely listening: Imperial
 Rescripts have gone out from Turin; there will be secret
 Convention at Vienna. Catherine of Russia beckons approvingly;
 will help, were she ready. Spanish Bourbon stirs amid his
 pillows; from him too, even from him, shall there come help. Lean
 Pitt, “the Minister of Preparatives,” looks out from his
 watch-tower in Saint-James’s, in a suspicious manner. Councillors
 plotting, Calonnes dim-hovering;—alas, Serjeants rub-a-dubbing
 openly through all manner of German market-towns, collecting
 ragged valour![436] Look where you will, immeasurable
 Obscurantism is girdling this fair France; which, again, will not
 be girdled by it. Europe is in travail; pang after pang; what a
 shriek was that of Pilnitz! The birth will be: WAR. Nay the worst feature of the business is this last, still to be
 named; the Emigrants at Coblentz, so many thousands ranking
 there, in bitter hate and menace: King’s Brothers, all Princes of
 the Blood except wicked d’Orléans; your duelling de Castries,
 your eloquent Cazalès; bull-headed Malseignes, a wargod Broglie;
 Distaff Seigneurs, insulted Officers, all that have ridden across
 the Rhine-stream;—d’Artois welcoming Abbé Maury with a kiss, and
 clasping him publicly to his own royal heart! Emigration, flowing
 over the Frontiers, now in drops, now in streams, in various
 humours of fear, of petulance, rage and hope, ever since those
 first Bastille days when d’Artois went, “to shame the citizens of
 Paris,”—has swollen to the size of a Phenomenon of the world.
 Coblentz is become a small extra-national Versailles; a
 Versailles _in partibus:_ briguing, intriguing, favouritism,
 strumpetocracy itself, they say, goes on there; all the old
 activities, on a small scale, quickened by hungry Revenge. Enthusiasm, of loyalty, of hatred and hope, has risen to a high
 pitch; as, in any Coblentz tavern, you may hear, in speech, and
 in singing. Maury assists in the interior Council; much is
 decided on; for one thing, they keep lists of the dates of your
 emigrating; a month sooner, or a month later determines your
 greater or your less right to the coming Division of the Spoil.
 Cazalès himself, because he had occasionally spoken with a
 Constitutional tone, was looked on coldly at first: so pure are
 our principles.[437] And arms are a-hammering at Liège; “three
 thousand horses” ambling hitherward from the Fairs of Germany:
 Cavalry enrolling; likewise Foot-soldiers, “in blue coat, red
 waistcoat, and nankeen trousers!”[438] They have their secret
 domestic correspondences, as their open foreign: with disaffected
 Crypto-Aristocrats, with contumacious Priests, with Austrian
 Committee in the Tuileries. Deserters are spirited over by
 assiduous crimps; Royal-Allemand is gone almost wholly. Their
 route of march, towards France and the Division of the Spoil, is
 marked out, were the Kaiser once ready. ‘It is said, they mean to
 poison the sources; but,’ adds Patriotism making Report of it,
 ‘they will not poison the source of Liberty,’ whereat “_on
 applaudit_,” we cannot but applaud. Also they have manufactories
 of False Assignats; and men that circulate in the interior
 distributing and disbursing the same; one of these we denounce
 now to Legislative Patriotism: “A man Lebrun by name; about
 thirty years of age, with blonde hair and in quantity; has,” only
 for the time being surely, “a black-eye, _œil poché;_ goes in a
 _wiski_ with a black horse,”[439]—always keeping his Gig! Unhappy Emigrants, it was their lot, and the lot of France! They
 are ignorant of much that they should know: of themselves, of
 what is around them. A Political Party that knows not _when it is
 beaten_, may become one of the fatallist of things, to itself,
 and to all. Nothing will convince these men that they cannot
 scatter the French Revolution at the first blast of their
 war-trumpet; that the French Revolution is other than a
 blustering Effervescence, of brawlers and spouters, which, at the
 flash of chivalrous broadswords, at the rustle of gallows-ropes,
 will burrow itself, in dens the deeper the welcomer. But, alas,
 what man does know and measure himself, and the things that are
 round him;—else where were the need of physical fighting at all?
 Never, till they are cleft asunder, can these heads believe that
 a Sansculottic arm has any vigour in it: cleft asunder, it will
 be too late to believe. One may say, without spleen against his poor erring brothers of
 any side, that above all other mischiefs, this of the Emigrant
 Nobles acted fatally on France. Could they have known, could they
 have understood! In the beginning of 1789, a splendour and a
 terror still surrounded them: the Conflagration of their
 Châteaus, kindled by months of obstinacy, went out after the
 Fourth of August; and might have continued out, had they at all
 known what to defend, what to relinquish as indefensible. They
 were still a graduated Hierarchy of Authorities, or the
 accredited Similitude of such: they sat there, uniting King with
 Commonalty; transmitting and translating _gradually_, from degree
 to degree, the command of the one into the obedience of the
 other; rendering command and obedience still possible. Had they
 understood their place, and what to do in it, this French
 Revolution, which went forth explosively in years and in months,
 might have spread itself over generations; and not a
 torture-death but a quiet euthanasia have been provided for many
 things. But they were proud and high, these men; they were not wise to
 consider. They spurned all from them; in disdainful hate, they
 drew the sword and flung away the scabbard. France has not only
 no Hierarchy of Authorities, to translate command into obedience;
 its Hierarchy of Authorities has fled to the enemies of France;
 calls loudly on the enemies of France to interfere armed, who
 want but a pretext to do that. Jealous Kings and Kaisers might
 have looked on long, meditating interference, yet afraid and
 ashamed to interfere: but now do not the King’s Brothers, and all
 French Nobles, Dignitaries and Authorities that are free to
 speak, which the King himself is not,—passionately invite us, in
 the name of Right and of Might? Ranked at Coblentz, from Fifteen
 to Twenty thousand stand now brandishing their weapons, with the
 cry: On, on! Yes, Messieurs, you shall on;—and divide the spoil
 according to your dates of emigrating. Of all which things a poor Legislative Assembly, and Patriot
 France, is informed: by denunciant friend, by triumphant foe.
 Sulleau’s Pamphlets, of the Rivarol Staff of Genius, circulate;
 heralding supreme hope. Durosoy’s Placards tapestry the walls;
 _Chant du Coq_ crows day, pecked at by Tallien’s _Ami des
 Citoyens_. King’s-Friend, Royou, _Ami du Roi_, can name, in exact
 arithmetical ciphers, the contingents of the various Invading
 Potentates; in all, Four hundred and nineteen thousand Foreign
 fighting men, with Fifteen thousand Emigrants. Not to reckon
 these your daily and hourly desertions, which an Editor must
 daily record, of whole Companies, and even Regiments, crying
 _Vive le Roi, Vive la Reine_, and marching over with banners
 spread:[440]—lies all, and wind; yet to Patriotism not wind; nor,
 alas, one day, to Royou! Patriotism, therefore, may brawl and
 babble yet a little while: but its hours are numbered: Europe is
 coming with Four hundred and nineteen thousand and the Chivalry
 of France; the gallows, one may hope, will get its own.
 Chapter 2.5.VI.
 Brigands and Jalès. We shall have War, then; and on what terms! With an Executive
 “pretending,” really with less and less deceptiveness now, “to be
 dead;” casting even a wishful eye towards the enemy: on such
 terms we shall have War. Public Functionary in vigorous action there is none; if it be not
 Rivarol with his Staff of Genius and Two hundred and eighty
 Applauders. The Public Service lies waste: the very tax-gatherer
 has forgotten his cunning: in this and the other Provincial Board
 of Management (_Directoire de Départment_) it is found advisable
 to _retain_ what Taxes you can gather, to pay your own inevitable
 expenditures. Our Revenue is Assignats; emission on emission of
 Paper-money. And the Army; our Three grand Armies, of Rochambeau,
 of Lückner, of Lafayette? Lean, disconsolate hover these Three
 grand Armies, watching the Frontiers there; three Flights of
 long-necked Cranes in moulting time;—wretched, disobedient,
 disorganised; who never saw fire; the old Generals and Officers
 gone across the Rhine. War-minister Narbonne, he of the
 rose-coloured Reports, solicits recruitments, equipments, money,
 always money; threatens, since he can get none,—to “take his
 sword,” which belongs to himself, and go serve his country with
 that.[441] The question of questions is: What shall be done? Shall we, with
 a desperate defiance which Fortune sometimes favours, draw the
 sword at once, in the face of this in-rushing world of Emigration
 and Obscurantism; or wait, and temporise and diplomatise, till,
 if possible, our resources mature themselves a little? And yet
 again are our resources growing towards maturity; or growing the
 _other_ way? Dubious: the ablest Patriots are divided; Brissot
 and his Brissotins, or Girondins, in the Legislative, cry aloud
 for the former defiant plan; Robespierre, in the Jacobins, pleads
 as loud for the latter dilatory one: with responses, even with
 mutual reprimands; distracting the Mother of Patriotism. Consider
 also what agitated Breakfasts there may be at Madame d’Udon’s in
 the Place Vendôme! The alarm of all men is great. Help, ye
 Patriots; and O at least agree; for the hour presses. Frost was
 not yet gone, when in that “tolerably handsome apartment of the
 Castle of Niort,” there arrived a Letter: General Dumouriez must
 to Paris. It is War-minister Narbonne that writes; the General
 shall give counsel about many things.[442] In the month of
 February 1792, Brissotin friends welcome their Dumouriez
 _Polymetis_,—comparable really to an antique Ulysses in modern
 costume; quick, elastic, shifty, insuppressible, a
 “many-counselled man.” Let the Reader fancy this fair France with a whole Cimmerian
 Europe girdling her, rolling in on her; black, to burst in red
 thunder of War; fair France herself hand-shackled and
 foot-shackled in the weltering complexities of this Social
 Clothing, or Constitution, which they have made for her; a France
 that, in such Constitution, cannot march! And Hunger too; and
 plotting Aristocrats, and excommunicating Dissident Priests: “The
 man Lebrun by name” urging his black _wiski_, visible to the eye:
 and, still more terrible in his invisibility, Engineer Goguelat,
 with Queen’s cipher, riding and running! The excommunicatory Priests give new trouble in the Maine and
 Loire; La Vendée, nor Cathelineau the wool-dealer, has not ceased
 grumbling and rumbling. Nay behold Jalès itself once more: how
 often does that real-imaginary Camp of the Fiend require to be
 extinguished! For near two years now, it has waned faint and
 again waxed bright, in the bewildered soul of Patriotism:
 actually, if Patriotism knew it, one of the most surprising
 products of Nature working with Art. Royalist Seigneurs, under
 this or the other pretext, assemble the simple people of these
 Cevennes Mountains; men not unused to revolt, and with heart for
 fighting, could their poor heads be got persuaded. The Royalist
 Seigneur harangues; harping mainly on the religious string: ‘True
 Priests maltreated, false Priests intruded, Protestants (once
 dragooned) now triumphing, things sacred given to the dogs;’ and
 so produces, from the pious Mountaineer throat, rough growlings.
 ‘Shall we not testify, then, ye brave hearts of the Cevennes;
 march to the rescue? Holy Religion; duty to God and King?’ ‘_Si
 fait, si fait_, Just so, just so,’ answer the brave hearts
 always: ‘_Mais il y a de bien bonnes choses dans la Révolution_,
 But there are many good things in the Revolution too!’—And so the
 matter, cajole as we may, will only turn on its axis, not stir
 from the spot, and remains theatrical merely.[443] Nevertheless deepen your cajolery, harp quick and quicker, ye
 Royalist Seigneurs; with a dead-lift effort you may bring it to
 that. In the month of June next, this _Camp of Jalès_ will step
 forth as a theatricality suddenly become real; Two thousand
 strong, and with the boast that it is Seventy thousand: most
 strange to see; with flags flying, bayonets fixed; with
 Proclamation, and d’Artois Commission of civil war! Let some
 Rebecqui, or other the like hot-clear Patriot; let some
 “Lieutenant-Colonel Aubry,” if Rebecqui is busy elsewhere, raise
 instantaneous National Guards, and disperse and dissolve it; and
 blow the Old Castle asunder,[444] that so, if possible, we hear
 of it no more! In the Months of February and March, it is recorded, the terror,
 especially of rural France, had risen even to the transcendental
 pitch: not far from madness. In Town and Hamlet is rumour; of
 war, massacre: that Austrians, Aristocrats, above all, that _The
 Brigands_ are close by. Men quit their houses and huts; rush
 fugitive, shrieking, with wife and child, they know not whither.
 Such a terror, the eye-witnesses say, never fell on a Nation; nor
 shall again fall, even in Reigns of Terror expressly so-called.
 The Countries of the Loire, all the Central and South-East
 regions, start up distracted, “simultaneously as by an electric
 shock;”—for indeed grain too gets scarcer and scarcer. “The
 people barricade the entrances of Towns, pile stones in the upper
 stories, the women prepare boiling water; from moment to moment,
 expecting the attack. In the Country, the alarm-bell rings
 incessant: troops of peasants, gathered by it, scour the
 highways, seeking an imaginary enemy. They are armed mostly with
 scythes stuck in wood; and, arriving in wild troops at the
 barricaded Towns, are themselves sometimes taken for
 Brigands.”[445] So rushes old France: old France is rushing _down_. What the end
 will be is known to no mortal; that the end is near all mortals
 may know.
 Chapter 2.5.VII.
 Constitution will not march. To all which our poor Legislative, tied up by an unmarching
 Constitution, can oppose nothing, by way of remedy, but mere
 bursts of parliamentary eloquence! They go on, debating,
 denouncing, objurgating: loud weltering Chaos, which devours
 _itself._ But their two thousand and odd Decrees? Reader, these happily
 concern not thee, nor me. Mere Occasional Decrees, foolish and
 not foolish; sufficient for _that_ day was its own evil! Of the
 whole two thousand there are not, now half a score, and these
 mostly blighted in the bud by royal _Veto_, that will profit or
 disprofit us. On the 17th of January, the Legislative, for one
 thing, got its High Court, its _Haute Cour_, set up at Orléans.
 The theory had been given by the Constituent, in May last, but
 this is the reality: a Court for the trial of Political Offences;
 a Court which cannot want work. To this it was decreed that there
 needed no royal Acceptance, therefore that there could be no
 _Veto_. Also Priests can now be married; ever since last October.
 A patriotic adventurous Priest had made bold to marry himself
 then; and not thinking this enough, came to the bar with his new
 spouse; that the whole world might hold honey-moon with him, and
 a Law be obtained. Less joyful are the Laws against Refractory Priests; and yet no
 less needful! Decrees on Priests and Decrees on Emigrants: these
 are the two brief Series of Decrees, worked out with endless
 debate, and then cancelled by _Veto_, which mainly concern us
 here. For an august National Assembly must needs conquer these
 Refractories, Clerical or Laic, and thumbscrew them into
 obedience; yet, behold, always as you turn your legislative
 thumbscrew, and will press and even crush till Refractories give
 way,—King’s _Veto_ steps in, with magical paralysis; and your
 thumbscrew, hardly squeezing, much less crushing, does not act! Truly a melancholy Set of Decrees, a pair of Sets; paralysed by
 _Veto!_ First, under date the 28th of October 1791, we have
 Legislative Proclamation, issued by herald and bill-sticker;
 inviting Monsieur, the King’s Brother to return within two
 months, under penalties. To which invitation Monsieur replies
 nothing; or indeed replies by Newspaper Parody, inviting the
 august Legislative “to return to common sense within two months,”
 under penalties. Whereupon the Legislative must take stronger
 measures. So, on the 9th of November, we declare all Emigrants to
 be “suspect of conspiracy;” and, in brief, to be “outlawed,” if
 they have not returned at Newyear’s-day:—Will the King say
 _Veto?_ That “triple impost” shall be levied on these men’s
 Properties, or even their Properties be “put in sequestration,”
 one can understand. But further, on Newyear’s-day itself, not an
 individual having “returned,” we declare, and with fresh emphasis
 some fortnight later again declare, That Monsieur is _déchu_,
 forfeited of his eventual Heirship to the Crown; nay more that
 Condé, Calonne, and a considerable List of others are accused of
 high treason; and shall be judged by our High Court of Orléans:
 _Veto!_—Then again as to Nonjurant Priests: it was decreed, in
 November last, that they should forfeit what Pensions they had;
 be “put under inspection, under _surveillance_,” and, if need
 were, be banished: _Veto!_ A still sharper turn is coming; but to
 this also the answer will be, _Veto_. _Veto_ after _Veto;_ your thumbscrew paralysed! Gods and men may
 see that the Legislative is in a false position. As, alas, who is
 in a true one? Voices already murmur for a “National
 Convention.”[446] This poor Legislative, spurred and stung into
 action by a whole France and a whole Europe, cannot act; can only
 objurgate and perorate; with stormy “motions,” and motion in
 which is no _way;_ with effervescence, with noise and fuliginous
 fury! What scenes in that National Hall! President jingling his
 inaudible bell; or, as utmost signal of distress, clapping on his
 hat; “the tumult subsiding in twenty minutes,” and this or the
 other indiscreet Member sent to the Abbaye Prison for three days!
 Suspected Persons must be summoned and questioned; old M. de
 Sombreuil of the _Invalides_ has to give account of himself, and
 why he leaves his Gates open. Unusual smoke rose from the Sèvres
 Pottery, indicating conspiracy; the Potters explained that it was
 Necklace-Lamotte’s _Mémoires_, bought up by her Majesty, which
 they were endeavouring to suppress by fire,[447]—which
 nevertheless he that runs may still read. Again, it would seem, Duke de Brissac and the King’s
 Constitutional-Guard are “making cartridges secretly in the
 cellars;” a set of Royalists, pure and impure; black cut-throats
 many of them, picked out of gaming houses and sinks; in all Six
 thousand instead of Eighteen hundred; who evidently gloom on us
 every time we enter the Château.[448] Wherefore, with infinite
 debate, let Brissac and King’s Guard be _disbanded_. Disbanded
 accordingly they are; after only two months of existence, for
 they did not get on foot till March of this same year. So ends
 briefly the King’s new Constitutional _Maison Militaire;_ he must
 now be guarded by mere Swiss and blue Nationals again. It seems
 the lot of Constitutional things. New Constitutional _Maison
 Civile_ he would never even establish, much as Barnave urged it;
 old resident Duchesses sniffed at it, and held aloof; on the
 whole her Majesty thought it not worth while, the Noblesse would
 so soon be back triumphant.[449] Or, looking still into this National Hall and its scenes, behold
 Bishop Torné, a Constitutional Prelate, not of severe morals,
 demanding that “religious costumes and such caricatures” be
 abolished. Bishop Torné warms, catches fire; finishes by untying,
 and indignantly flinging on the table, as if for gage or bet, his
 own pontifical cross. Which cross, at any rate, is instantly
 covered by the cross of _Te-Deum_ Fauchet, then by other crosses,
 and insignia, till all are stripped; this clerical Senator
 clutching off his skull-cap, that other his frill-collar,—lest
 Fanaticism return on us.[450] Quick is the movement here! And then so confused, unsubstantial,
 you might call it almost _spectral;_ pallid, dim, inane, like the
 Kingdoms of Dis! Unruly Liguet, shrunk to a kind of spectre for
 us, pleads here, some cause that he has: amid rumour and
 interruption, which excel human patience; he “tears his papers,
 and withdraws,” the irascible adust little man. Nay honourable
 members will tear their papers, being effervescent: Merlin of
 Thionville tears his papers, crying: ‘So, the People cannot be
 saved by _you!_’ Nor are Deputations wanting: Deputations of
 Sections; generally with complaint and denouncement, always with
 Patriot fervour of sentiment: Deputation of Women, pleading that
 they also may be allowed to take Pikes, and exercise in the
 Champ-de-Mars. Why not, ye Amazons, if it be in you? Then
 occasionally, having done our message and got answer, we “defile
 through the Hall, singing _ça-ira;_” or rather roll and whirl
 through it, “dancing our _ronde patriotique_ the while,”—our new
 _Carmagnole_, or Pyrrhic war-dance and liberty-dance. Patriot
 Huguenin, Ex-Advocate, Ex-Carabineer, Ex-Clerk of the Barriers,
 comes deputed, with Saint-Antoine at his heels; denouncing
 Anti-patriotism, Famine, Forstalment and Man-eaters; asks an
 august Legislative: ‘Is there not a _tocsin in your hearts_
 against these _mangeurs d’hommes!_’[451] But above all things, for this is a continual business, the
 Legislative has to reprimand the King’s Ministers. Of His
 Majesty’s Ministers we have said hitherto, and say, next to
 nothing. Still more spectral these! Sorrowful; of no permanency
 any of them, none at least since Montmorin vanished: the “eldest
 of the King’s Council” is occasionally not ten days old![452]
 Feuillant-Constitutional, as your respectable Cahier de Gerville,
 as your respectable unfortunate Delessarts; or
 Royalist-Constitutional, as Montmorin last Friend of Necker; or
 Aristocrat as Bertrand-Moleville: they flit there phantom-like,
 in the huge simmering confusion; poor shadows, dashed in the
 racking winds; powerless, without meaning;—whom the human memory
 need not charge itself with. But how often, we say, are these poor Majesty’s Ministers
 summoned over; to be questioned, tutored; nay, threatened, almost
 bullied! They answer what, with adroitest simulation and
 casuistry, they can: of which a poor Legislative knows not what
 to make. One thing only is clear, That Cimmerian Europe is
 girdling us in; that France (not actually dead, surely?) cannot
 march. Have a care, ye Ministers! Sharp Guadet transfixes you
 with cross-questions, with sudden Advocate-conclusions; the
 sleeping tempest that is in Vergniaud can be awakened. Restless
 Brissot brings up Reports, Accusations, endless thin Logic; it is
 the man’s highday even now. Condorcet redacts, with his firm pen,
 our “Address of the Legislative Assembly to the French
 Nation.”[453] Fiery Max Isnard, who, for the rest, will ‘carry
 not Fire and Sword’ on those Cimmerian Enemies ‘but Liberty,’—is
 for declaring ‘that we hold Ministers responsible; and that by
 responsibility we mean death, _nous entendons la mort_.’ For verily it grows serious: the time presses, and traitors there
 are. Bertrand-Moleville has a smooth tongue, the known
 Aristocrat; gall in his heart. How his answers and explanations
 flow ready; jesuitic, plausible to the ear! But perhaps the
 notablest is this, which befell once when Bertrand had done
 answering and was withdrawn. Scarcely had the august Assembly
 begun considering what was to be done with him, when the Hall
 fills with _smoke_. Thick sour smoke: no oratory, only wheezing
 and barking;—irremediable; so that the august Assembly has to
 adjourn![454] A miracle? Typical miracle? One knows not: only
 this one seems to know, that “the Keeper of the Stoves _was
 appointed_ by Bertrand” or by some underling of his!—O fuliginous
 confused Kingdom of Dis, with thy Tantalus-Ixion toils, with thy
 angry Fire-floods, and Streams named of Lamentation, why hast
 thou not thy Lethe too, that so one might _finish?_
 Chapter 2.5.VIII.
 The Jacobins. Nevertheless let not Patriotism despair. Have we not, in Paris at
 least, a virtuous Pétion, a wholly Patriotic Municipality?
 Virtuous Pétion, ever since November, is Mayor of Paris: in our
 Municipality, the Public, for the Public is now admitted too, may
 behold an energetic Danton; further, an epigrammatic slow-sure
 Manuel; a resolute unrepentant Billaud-Varennes, of Jesuit
 breeding; Tallien able-editor; and nothing but Patriots, better
 or worse. So ran the November Elections: to the joy of most
 citizens; nay the very Court supported Pétion rather than
 Lafayette. And so Bailly and his Feuillants, long waning like the
 Moon, had to withdraw then, making some sorrowful obeisance, into
 extinction;—or indeed into worse, into lurid half-light, grimmed
 by the shadow of that Red Flag of theirs, and bitter memory of
 the Champ-de-Mars. How swift is the progress of things and men!
 Not now does Lafayette, as on that Federation-day, when _his_
 noon was, “press his sword firmly on the Fatherland’s Altar,” and
 swear in sight of France: ah no; he, waning and setting ever
 since that hour, hangs now, disastrous, on the edge of the
 horizon; commanding one of those Three moulting Crane-flights of
 Armies, in a most suspected, unfruitful, uncomfortable manner! But, at most, cannot Patriotism, so many thousands strong in this
 Metropolis of the Universe, help itself? Has it not right-hands,
 pikes? Hammering of pikes, which was not to be prohibited by
 Mayor Bailly, has been sanctioned by Mayor Pétion; sanctioned by
 Legislative Assembly. How not, when the King’s so-called
 Constitutional Guard “was making cartridges in secret?” Changes
 are necessary for the National Guard itself; this whole
 Feuillant-Aristocrat Staff of the Guard must be disbanded.
 Likewise, citizens without uniform may surely rank in the Guard,
 the pike beside the musket, in such a time: the “active” citizen
 and the passive who can fight for us, are they not both
 welcome?—O my Patriot friends, indubitably Yes! Nay the truth is,
 Patriotism throughout, were it never so white-frilled, logical,
 respectable, must either lean itself heartily on Sansculottism,
 the black, bottomless; or else vanish, in the frightfullest way,
 to Limbo! Thus some, with upturned nose, will altogether sniff
 and disdain Sansculottism; others will lean heartily on it; nay
 others again will lean what we call _heartlessly_ on it: three
 sorts; each sort with a destiny corresponding.[455] In such point of view, however, have we not for the present a
 Volunteer Ally, stronger than all the rest: namely, Hunger?
 Hunger; and what rushing of Panic Terror this and the sum-total
 of our other miseries may bring! For Sansculottism grows by what
 all other things die of. Stupid Peter Baille almost made an
 epigram, though unconsciously, and with the Patriot world
 laughing not at it but at him, when he wrote “_Tout va bien ici,
 le pain manque_, All goes well here, victuals not to be
 had.”[456] Neither, if you knew it, is Patriotism without her Constitution
 that _can_ march; her _not_ impotent Parliament; or call it,
 Ecumenic Council, and General-Assembly of the Jean-Jacques
 Churches: the MOTHER-SOCIETY, namely! Mother-Society with her
 three hundred full-grown Daughters; with what we can call little
 Granddaughters trying to walk, in every village of France,
 numerable, as Burke thinks, by the hundred thousand. This is the
 true Constitution; made not by Twelve-Hundred august Senators,
 but by Nature herself; and has grown, unconsciously, out of the
 wants and the efforts of these Twenty-five Millions of men. They
 are “Lords of the Articles,” our Jacobins; they originate debates
 for the Legislative; discuss Peace and War; settle beforehand
 what the Legislative is to do. Greatly to the scandal of
 philosophical men, and of most Historians;—who do in that judge
 naturally, and yet not wisely. A Governing power must exist: your
 other powers here are simulacra; this power is _it._ Great is the Mother Society: She has had the honour to be
 denounced by Austrian Kaunitz;[457] and is all the dearer to
 Patriotism. By fortune and valour, she has extinguished
 Feuillantism itself, at least the Feuillant Club. This latter,
 high as it once carried its head, she, on the 18th of February,
 has the satisfaction to see shut, extinct; Patriots having gone
 thither, with tumult, to hiss it out of pain. The Mother Society
 has enlarged her locality, stretches now over the whole nave of
 the Church. Let us glance in, with the worthy Toulongeon, our old
 Ex-Constituent Friend, who happily has eyes to see: “The nave of
 the Jacobins Church,” says he, “is changed into a vast Circus,
 the seats of which mount up circularly like an amphitheatre to
 the very groin of the domed roof. A high Pyramid of black marble,
 built against one of the walls, which was formerly a funeral
 monument, has alone been left standing: it serves now as back to
 the Office-bearers’ Bureau. Here on an elevated Platform sit
 President and Secretaries, behind and above them the white Busts
 of Mirabeau, of Franklin, and various others, nay finally of
 Marat. Facing this is the Tribune, raised till it is midway
 between floor and groin of the dome, so that the speaker’s voice
 may be in the centre. From that point, thunder the voices which
 shake all Europe: down below, in silence, are forging the
 thunderbolts and the firebrands. Penetrating into this huge
 circuit, where all is out of measure, gigantic, the mind cannot
 repress some movement of terror and wonder; the imagination
 recalls those dread temples which Poetry, of old, had consecrated
 to the Avenging Deities.”[458]');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Scenes too are in this Jacobin Amphitheatre,—had History time for
 them. Flags of the “Three free Peoples of the Universe,” trinal
 brotherly flags of England, America, France, have been waved here
 in concert; by London Deputation, of Whigs or _Wighs_ and their
 Club, on this hand, and by young French Citizenesses on that;
 beautiful sweet-tongued Female Citizens, who solemnly send over
 salutation and brotherhood, also Tricolor stitched by their own
 needle, and finally Ears of Wheat; while the dome rebellows with
 _Vivent les trois peuples libres!_ from all throats:—a most
 dramatic scene. Demoiselle Théroigne recites, from that Tribune
 in mid air, her persecutions in Austria; comes leaning on the arm
 of Joseph Chénier, Poet Chénier, to demand Liberty for the
 hapless Swiss of Château-Vieux.[459] Be of hope, ye Forty Swiss;
 tugging there, in the Brest waters; _not_ forgotten! Deputy Brissot perorates from that Tribune; Desmoulins, our
 wicked Camille, interjecting audibly from below, ‘_Coquin!_’
 Here, though oftener in the Cordeliers, reverberates the
 lion-voice of Danton; grim Billaud-Varennes is here; Collot
 d’Herbois, pleading for the Forty Swiss; tearing a passion to
 rags. Apophthegmatic Manuel winds up in this pithy way: ‘A
 Minister must perish!’—to which the Amphitheatre responds:
 ‘_Tous, Tous_, All, All!’ But the Chief Priest and Speaker of
 this place, as we said, is Robespierre, the long-winded
 incorruptible man. What spirit of Patriotism dwelt in men in
 those times, this one fact, it seems to us, will evince: that
 fifteen hundred human creatures, not bound to it, sat quiet under
 the oratory of Robespierre; nay, listened nightly, hour after
 hour, applausive; and gaped as for the word of life. More
 insupportable individual, one would say, seldom opened his mouth
 in any Tribune. Acrid, implacable-impotent; dull-drawling, barren
 as the Harmattan-wind! He pleads, in endless earnest-shallow
 speech, against immediate War, against Woollen Caps or _Bonnets
 Rouges_, against many things; and is the Trismegistus and
 Dalai-Lama of Patriot men. Whom nevertheless a shrill-voiced
 little man, yet with fine eyes, and a broad beautifully sloping
 brow, rises respectfully to controvert: he is, say the Newspaper
 Reporters, “M. Louvet, Author of the charming Romance of
 _Faublas_.” Steady, ye Patriots! Pull not _yet_ two ways; with a
 France rushing panic-stricken in the rural districts, and a
 Cimmerian Europe storming in on you!
 Chapter 2.5.IX.
 Minister Roland. About the vernal equinox, however, one unexpected gleam of hope
 does burst forth on Patriotism: the appointment of a thoroughly
 Patriot Ministry. This also his Majesty, among his innumerable
 experiments of wedding fire to water, will try. _Quod bonum sit_.
 Madame d’Udon’s Breakfasts have jingled with a new significance;
 not even Genevese Dumont but had a word in it. Finally, on the
 15th and onwards to the 23d day of March, 1792, when all is
 negociated,—this is the blessed issue; this Patriot Ministry that
 we see. General Dumouriez, with the Foreign Portfolio shall ply Kaunitz
 and the Kaiser, in another style than did poor Delessarts; whom
 indeed we have sent to our High Court of Orléans for his
 sluggishness. War-minister Narbonne is washed away by the
 Time-flood; poor Chevalier de Grave, chosen by the Court, is fast
 washing away: then shall austere Servan, able Engineer-Officer,
 mount suddenly to the War Department. Genevese Clavière sees an
 old omen realized: passing the Finance Hotel, long years ago, as
 a poor Genevese Exile, it was borne wondrously on his mind that
 _he_ was to be Finance Minister; and now he is it;—and his poor
 Wife, given up by the Doctors, rises and walks, not the victim of
 nerves but their vanquisher.[460] And above all, our Minister of
 the Interior? Roland de la Platrière, he of Lyons! So have the
 Brissotins, public or private Opinion, and Breakfasts in the
 Place Vendôme decided it. Strict Roland, compared to a _Quaker
 endimanché_, or Sunday Quaker, goes to kiss hands at the
 Tuileries, in round hat and sleek hair, his shoes tied with mere
 riband or ferrat! The Supreme Usher twitches Dumouriez aside:
 ‘_Quoi, Monsieur!_ No buckles to his shoes?’—‘Ah, Monsieur,’
 answers Dumouriez, glancing towards the ferrat: ‘All is lost,
 _Tout est perdu_.’[461] And so our fair Roland removes from her upper floor in the Rue
 Saint-Jacques, to the sumptuous saloons once occupied by Madame
 Necker. Nay still earlier, it was Calonne that did all this
 gilding; it was he who ground these lustres, Venetian mirrors;
 who polished this inlaying, this veneering and or-moulu; and made
 it, by rubbing of the proper _lamp_, an Aladdin’s Palace:—and now
 behold, he wanders dim-flitting over Europe, half-drowned in the
 Rhine-stream, scarcely saving his Papers! _Vos non vobis_.—The
 fair Roland, equal to either fortune, has her public Dinner on
 Fridays, the Ministers all there in a body: she withdraws to her
 desk (the cloth once removed), and seems busy writing;
 nevertheless loses no word: if for example Deputy Brissot and
 Minister Clavière get too hot in argument, she, not without
 timidity, yet with a cunning gracefulness, will interpose. Deputy
 Brissot’s head, they say, is getting giddy, in this sudden
 height: as feeble heads do. Envious men insinuate that the Wife Roland is Minister, and not
 the Husband: it is happily the worst they have to charge her
 with. For the rest, let whose head soever be getting giddy, it is
 not this brave woman’s. Serene and queenly here, as she was of
 old in her own hired garret of the Ursulines Convent! She who has
 quietly shelled French-beans for her dinner; being led to that,
 as a young maiden, by quiet insight and computation; and knowing
 what that was, and what she was: such a one will also look
 quietly on or-moulu and veneering, not ignorant of these either.
 Calonne did the veneering: he gave dinners here, old Besenval
 diplomatically whispering to him; and was great: yet Calonne we
 saw at last “walk with long strides.” Necker next: and where now
 is Necker? Us also a swift change has brought hither; a swift
 change will send us hence. Not a Palace but a Caravansera! So wags and wavers this unrestful World, day after day, month
 after month. The Streets of Paris, and all Cities, roll daily
 their oscillatory flood of men; which flood does, nightly,
 disappear, and lie hidden horizontal in beds and trucklebeds; and
 awakes on the morrow to new perpendicularity and movement. Men go
 their roads, foolish or wise;—Engineer Goguelat to and fro,
 bearing Queen’s cipher. A Madame de Staël is busy; cannot clutch
 her Narbonne from the Time-flood: a Princess de Lamballe is busy;
 cannot help her Queen. Barnave, seeing the Feuillants dispersed,
 and Coblentz so brisk, begs by way of final recompence to kiss
 her Majesty’s hand; augurs not well of her new course; and
 retires home to Grenoble, to wed an heiress there. The Café
 Valois and Méot the Restaurateur’s hear daily gasconade; loud
 babble of Half-pay Royalists, with or without Poniards; remnants
 of Aristocrat saloons call the new Ministry
 _Ministère-Sansculotte_. A Louvet, of the Romance _Faublas_, is
 busy in the Jacobins. A Cazotte, of the Romance _Diable
 Amoureux_, is busy elsewhere: better wert thou quiet, old
 Cazotte; it is a world, this, of magic become _real!_ All men are
 busy; doing they only half guess what:—flinging seeds, of tares
 mostly, into the ‘Seed-field of TIME’ this, by and by, will
 declare wholly what. But Social Explosions have in them something dread, and as it
 were mad and magical: which indeed Life always secretly has; thus
 the dumb Earth (says Fable), if you pull her mandrake-roots, will
 give a dæmonic mad-making _moan_. These Explosions and Revolts
 ripen, break forth like dumb dread Forces of Nature; and yet they
 are Men’s forces; and yet _we_ are part of them: the Dæmonic that
 is in man’s life has burst out on us, will sweep us too away!—One
 day here is like another, and yet it is not like but different.
 How much is growing, silently resistless, at all moments!
 Thoughts are growing; forms of Speech are growing, and Customs
 and even Costumes; still more visibly are actions and
 transactions growing, and that doomed Strife, of France with
 herself and with the whole world. The word _Liberty_ is never named now except in conjunction with
 another; _Liberty_ and _Equality_. In like manner, what, in a
 reign of Liberty and Equality, can these words, “Sir,” “obedient
 Servant,” “Honour to be,” and such like, signify? Tatters and
 fibres of old Feudality; which, were it only in the Grammatical
 province, ought to be rooted out! The Mother Society has long
 since had proposals to that effect: these she could not
 entertain, not at the moment. Note too how the Jacobin Brethren
 are mounting new symbolical headgear: the Woollen Cap or
 Nightcap, _bonnet de laine_, better known as _bonnet rouge_, the
 colour being _red_. A thing one wears not only by way of Phrygian
 Cap-of-Liberty, but also for convenience” sake, and then also in
 compliment to the Lower-class Patriots and Bastille-Heroes; for
 the Red Nightcap combines all the three properties. Nay cockades
 themselves begin to be made of wool, of tricolor yarn: the
 riband-cockade, as a symptom of Feuillant Upper-class temper, is
 becoming suspicious. Signs of the times. Still more, note the travail-throes of Europe: or, rather, note
 the birth she brings; for the successive throes and shrieks, of
 Austrian and Prussian Alliance, of Kaunitz Anti-jacobin Despatch,
 of French Ambassadors cast out, and so forth, were long to note.
 Dumouriez corresponds with Kaunitz, Metternich, or Cobentzel, in
 another style that Delessarts did. Strict becomes stricter;
 categorical answer, as to this Coblentz work and much else, shall
 be given. Failing which? Failing which, on the 20th day of April
 1792, King and Ministers step over to the Salle de Manége;
 promulgate how the matter stands; and poor Louis, “with tears in
 his eyes,” proposes that the Assembly do now decree War. After
 due eloquence, War is decreed that night. War, indeed! Paris came all crowding, full of expectancy, to the
 morning, and still more to the evening session. D’Orléans with
 his two sons, is there; looks on, wide-eyed, from the opposite
 Gallery.[462] Thou canst look, O Philippe: it is a War big with
 issues, for thee and for all men. Cimmerian Obscurantism and this
 thrice glorious Revolution shall wrestle for it, then: some
 Four-and-twenty years; in immeasurable Briareus’ wrestle;
 trampling and tearing; before they can come to any, not
 agreement, but compromise, and approximate ascertainment each of
 what is in the other. Let our Three Generals on the Frontiers look to it, therefore;
 and poor Chevalier de Grave, the Warminister, consider what he
 will do. What is in the three Generals and Armies we may guess.
 As for poor Chevalier de Grave, he, in this whirl of things all
 coming to a press and pinch upon him, loses head, and merely
 whirls with them, in a totally distracted manner; signing himself
 at last, “De Grave, _Mayor of Paris;_” whereupon he demits,
 returns over the Channel, to walk in Kensington Gardens;[463] and
 austere Servan, the able Engineer-Officer, is elevated in his
 stead. To the post of Honour? To that of Difficulty, at least.
 Chapter 2.5.X.
 Pétion-National-Pique. And yet, how, on dark bottomless Cataracts there plays the
 foolishest fantastic-coloured spray and shadow; hiding the Abyss
 under vapoury rainbows! Alongside of this discussion as to
 Austrian-Prussian War, there goes on no less but more vehemently
 a discussion, Whether the Forty or Two-and-forty Swiss of
 Château-Vieux shall be liberated from the Brest Gallies? And
 then, Whether, being liberated, they shall have a public
 Festival, or only private ones? Théroigne, as we saw, spoke; and Collot took up the tale. Has not
 Bouillé’s final display of himself, in that final Night of Spurs,
 stamped your so-called “Revolt of Nanci” into a “Massacre of
 Nanci,” for all Patriot judgments? Hateful is that massacre;
 hateful the Lafayette-Feuillant “public thanks” given for it! For
 indeed, Jacobin Patriotism and dispersed Feuillantism are now at
 death-grips; and do fight with all weapons, even with scenic
 shows. The walls of Paris, accordingly, are covered with Placard
 and Counter-Placard, on the subject of Forty Swiss blockheads.
 Journal responds to Journal; Player Collot to Poetaster Roucher;
 Joseph Chénier the Jacobin, squire of Théroigne, to his Brother
 Andre the Feuillant; Mayor Pétion to Dupont de Nemours: and for
 the space of two months, there is nowhere peace for the thought
 of man,—till this thing be settled. _Gloria in excelsis!_ The Forty Swiss are at last got
 “amnestied.” Rejoice ye Forty: doff your greasy wool Bonnets,
 which shall become Caps of Liberty. The Brest Daughter-Society
 welcomes you from on board, with kisses on each cheek: your iron
 Handcuffs are disputed as Relics of Saints; the Brest Society
 indeed can have one portion, which it will beat into Pikes, a
 sort of Sacred Pikes; but the other portion must belong to Paris,
 and be suspended from the dome there, along with the Flags of the
 Three Free Peoples! Such a goose is man; and cackles over
 plush-velvet Grand Monarques and woollen Galley-slaves; over
 everything and over nothing,—and will cackle with his whole soul
 merely if others cackle! On the ninth morning of April, these Forty Swiss blockheads
 arrive. From Versailles; with _vivats_ heaven-high; with the
 affluence of men and women. To the Townhall we conduct them; nay
 to the Legislative itself, though not without difficulty. They
 are harangued, bedinnered, begifted,—the very Court, _not_ for
 conscience” sake, contributing something; and their Public
 Festival shall be next Sunday. Next Sunday accordingly it
 is.[464] They are mounted into a “triumphal Car resembling a
 ship;” are carted over Paris, with the clang of cymbals and
 drums, all mortals assisting applausive; carted to the
 Champ-de-Mars and Fatherland’s Altar; and finally carted, for
 Time always brings deliverance,—into invisibility for evermore. Whereupon dispersed Feuillantism, or that Party which loves
 Liberty yet not more than Monarchy, will likewise have its
 Festival: Festival of Simonneau, unfortunate Mayor of Etampes,
 who died for the Law; most surely for the Law, though Jacobinism
 disputes; being trampled down with his Red Flag in the riot about
 grains. At which Festival the Public again assists,
 _un_applausive: not we. On the whole, Festivals are not wanting; beautiful rainbow-spray
 when all is now rushing treble-quick towards its Niagara Fall.
 National repasts there are; countenanced by Mayor Pétion;
 Saint-Antoine, and the Strong Ones of the Halles defiling through
 Jacobin Club, ‘their felicity,’ according to Santerre, ‘not
 perfect otherwise;’ singing many-voiced their _ça-ira_, dancing
 their _ronde patriotique_. Among whom one is glad to discern
 Saint-Huruge, expressly “in white hat,” the Saint-Christopher of
 the Carmagnole. Nay a certain _Tambour_ or National Drummer,
 having just been presented with a little daughter, determines to
 have the new Frenchwoman christened on Fatherland’s Altar then
 and there. Repast once over, he accordingly has her christened;
 Fauchet the Te-Deum Bishop acting in chief, Thuriot and
 honourable persons standing gossips: by the name,
 Pétion-National-Pique![465] Does this remarkable Citizeness, now
 past the meridian of life, still walk the Earth? Or did she die
 perhaps of teething? Universal History is not indifferent.
 Chapter 2.5.XI.
 The Hereditary Representative. And yet it is not by carmagnole-dances and singing of _ça-ira_,
 that the work can be done. Duke Brunswick is not dancing
 carmagnoles, but has his drill serjeants busy. On the Frontiers, our Armies, be it treason or not, behave in the
 worst way. Troops badly commanded, shall we say? Or troops
 intrinsically bad? Unappointed, undisciplined, mutinous; that, in
 a thirty-years peace, have never seen fire? In any case,
 Lafayette’s and Rochambeau’s little clutch, which they made at
 Austrian Flanders, has prospered as badly as clutch need do:
 soldiers starting at their own shadow; suddenly shrieking, ‘_On
 nous trahit_,’ and flying off in wild panic, at or before the
 first shot;—managing only to hang some two or three Prisoners
 they had picked up, and massacre their own Commander, poor
 Theobald Dillon, driven into a granary by them in the Town of
 Lille. And poor Gouvion: he who sat shiftless in that Insurrection of
 Women! Gouvion quitted the Legislative Hall and Parliamentary
 duties, in disgust and despair, when those Galley-slaves of
 Château-Vieux were admitted there. He said, ‘Between the
 Austrians and the Jacobins there is nothing but a soldier’s death
 for it;’[466] and so, “in the dark stormy night,” he has flung
 himself into the throat of the Austrian cannon, and perished in
 the skirmish at Maubeuge on the ninth of June. Whom Legislative
 Patriotism shall mourn, with black mortcloths and melody in the
 Champ-de-Mars: many a Patriot shiftier, truer none. Lafayette
 himself is looking altogether dubious; in place of beating the
 Austrians, is about writing to denounce the Jacobins. Rochambeau,
 all disconsolate, quits the service: there remains only Lückner,
 the babbling old Prussian Grenadier. Without Armies, without Generals! And the Cimmerian Night, _has_
 gathered itself; Brunswick preparing his Proclamation; just about
 to march! Let a Patriot Ministry and Legislative say, what in
 these circumstances it will do? Suppress Internal Enemies, for
 one thing, answers the Patriot Legislative; and proposes, on the
 24th of May, its Decree for the Banishment of Priests. Collect
 also some nucleus of determined internal friends, adds
 War-minister Servan; and proposes, on the 7th of June, his Camp
 of Twenty-thousand. Twenty-thousand National Volunteers; Five out
 of each Canton; picked Patriots, for Roland has charge of the
 Interior: they shall assemble here in Paris; and be for a
 defence, cunningly devised, against foreign Austrians and
 domestic _Austrian Committee_ alike. So much can a Patriot
 Ministry and Legislative do. Reasonable and cunningly devised as such Camp may, to Servan and
 Patriotism, appear, it appears not so to Feuillantism; to that
 Feuillant-Aristocrat Staff of the Paris Guard; a Staff, one would
 say again, which will need to be _dissolved_. These men see, in
 this proposed Camp of Servan’s, an offence; and even, as they
 pretend to say, an insult. Petitions there come, in consequence,
 from blue Feuillants in epaulettes; ill received. Nay, in the
 end, there comes one Petition, called “of the Eight Thousand
 National Guards:” so many names are on it; including women and
 children. Which famed Petition of the Eight Thousand is indeed
 received: and the Petitioners, all under arms, are admitted to
 the honours of the sitting,—if honours or even if sitting there
 be; for the instant their bayonets appear at the one door, the
 Assembly “adjourns,” and begins to flow out at the other.[467] Also, in these same days, it is lamentable to see how National
 Guards, escorting _Fête Dieu_ or _Corpus-Christi_ ceremonial, do
 collar and smite down any Patriot that does not uncover as the
 Hostie passes. They clap their bayonets to the breast of
 Cattle-butcher Legendre, a known Patriot ever since the Bastille
 days; and threaten to butcher him; though he sat quite
 respectfully, he says, in his Gig, at a distance of fifty paces,
 waiting till the thing were by. Nay, orthodox females were
 shrieking to have down the _Lanterne_ on him.[468] To such height has Feuillantism gone in this Corps. For indeed,
 are not their Officers creatures of the chief Feuillant,
 Lafayette? The Court too has, very naturally, been tampering with
 them; caressing them, ever since that dissolution of the
 so-called Constitutional Guard. Some Battalions are altogether
 “_pétris_, kneaded full” of Feuillantism, mere Aristocrats at
 bottom: for instance, the Battalion of the _Filles-Saint-Thomas_,
 made up of your Bankers, Stockbrokers, and other Full-purses of
 the Rue Vivienne. Our worthy old Friend Weber, Queen’s
 Foster-brother Weber, carries a musket in that Battalion,—one may
 judge with what degree of Patriotic intention. Heedless of all which, or rather heedful of all which, the
 Legislative, backed by Patriot France and the feeling of
 Necessity, decrees this Camp of Twenty thousand. Decisive though
 conditional Banishment of malign Priests, it has already decreed. It will now be seen, therefore, Whether the Hereditary
 Representative is for us or against us? Whether or not, to all
 our other woes, this intolerablest one is to be added; which
 renders us not a menaced Nation in extreme jeopardy and need, but
 a paralytic Solecism of a Nation; sitting wrapped as in dead
 cerements, of a Constitutional-Vesture that were no other than a
 winding-sheet; our right hand glued to our left: to wait there,
 writhing and wriggling, unable to stir from the spot, till in
 Prussian rope we mount to the gallows? Let the Hereditary
 Representative consider it well: The Decree of Priests? The Camp
 of Twenty Thousand?—By Heaven, he answers, _Veto! Veto!_—Strict
 Roland hands in his _Letter to the King;_ or rather it was
 Madame’s Letter, who wrote it all at a sitting; one of the
 plainest-spoken Letters ever handed in to any King. This
 plain-spoken Letter King Louis has the benefit of reading
 overnight. He reads, inwardly digests; and next morning, the
 whole Patriot Ministry finds itself turned out. It is the 13th of
 June 1792.[469] Dumouriez the many-counselled, he, with one Duranthon, called
 Minister of Justice, does indeed linger for a day or two; in
 rather suspicious circumstances; speaks with the Queen, almost
 weeps with her: but in the end, he too sets off for the Army;
 leaving what Un-Patriot or Semi-Patriot Ministry and Ministries
 can now accept the helm, to accept it. Name them not: new
 quick-changing Phantasms, which shift like magic-lantern figures;
 more spectral than ever! Unhappy Queen, unhappy Louis! The two _Vetos_ were so natural:
 are not the Priests martyrs; also friends? This Camp of Twenty
 Thousand, could it be other than of stormfullest Sansculottes?
 Natural; and yet, to France, unendurable. Priests that co-operate
 with Coblentz must go elsewhither with their martyrdom: stormful
 Sansculottes, these and no other kind of creatures, will drive
 back the Austrians. If thou prefer the Austrians, then for the
 love of Heaven go join them. If not, join frankly with what will
 oppose them to the death. Middle course is none. Or alas, what extreme course was there left now, for a man like
 Louis? Underhand Royalists, Ex-Minister Bertrand-Moleville,
 Ex-Constituent Malouet, and all manner of unhelpful individuals,
 advise and advise. With face of hope turned now on the
 Legislative Assembly, and now on Austria and Coblentz, and round
 generally on the Chapter of Chances, an ancient Kingship is
 reeling and spinning, one knows not whitherward, on the flood of
 things.
 Chapter 2.5.XII.
 Procession of the Black Breeches. But is there a thinking man in France who, in these
 circumstances, can persuade himself that the Constitution will
 march? Brunswick is stirring; _he_, in few days now, will march.
 Shall France sit still, wrapped in dead cerements and
 grave-clothes, its right hand glued to its left, till the
 Brunswick Saint-Bartholomew arrive; till France be as Poland, and
 its Rights of Man become a Prussian Gibbet? Verily, it is a moment frightful for all men. National Death; or
 else some preternatural convulsive outburst of National
 Life;—that same, _dæmonic_ outburst! Patriots whose audacity has
 limits had, in truth, better retire like Barnave; court private
 felicity at Grenoble. Patriots, whose audacity has no limits must
 sink down into the obscure; and, daring and defying all things,
 seek salvation in stratagem, in Plot of Insurrection. Roland and
 young Barbaroux have spread out the Map of France before them,
 Barbaroux says “with tears:” they consider what Rivers, what
 Mountain ranges are in it: they will retire behind this
 Loire-stream, defend these Auvergne stone-labyrinths; save some
 little sacred Territory of the Free; die at least in their last
 ditch. Lafayette indites his emphatic Letter to the Legislative
 against Jacobinism;[470] which emphatic Letter will not heal the
 unhealable. Forward, ye Patriots whose audacity has no limits; it is you now
 that must either do or die! The sections of Paris sit in deep
 counsel; send out Deputation after Deputation to the Salle de
 Manége, to petition and denounce. Great is their ire against
 tyrannous _Veto, Austrian Committee_, and the combined Cimmerian
 Kings. What boots it? Legislative listens to the “tocsin in our
 hearts;” grants us honours of the sitting, sees us defile with
 jingle and fanfaronade; but the Camp of Twenty Thousand, the
 Priest-Decree, be-vetoed by Majesty, are become impossible for
 Legislative. Fiery Isnard says, ‘We will have Equality, should we
 descend for it to the tomb.’ Vergniaud utters, hypothetically,
 his stern Ezekiel-visions of the fate of Anti-national Kings. But
 the question is: Will hypothetic prophecies, will jingle and
 fanfaronade demolish the _Veto;_ or will the Veto, secure in its
 Tuileries Château, remain undemolishable by these? Barbaroux,
 dashing away his tears, writes to the Marseilles Municipality,
 that they must send him “Six hundred men who know how to die,
 _qui savent mourir_.”[471] No wet-eyed message this, but a
 fire-eyed one;—which will be obeyed! Meanwhile the Twentieth of June is nigh, anniversary of that
 world-famous Oath of the Tennis-Court: on which day, it is said,
 certain citizens have in view to plant a _Mai_ or Tree of
 Liberty, in the Tuileries Terrace of the Feuillants; perhaps also
 to petition the Legislative and Hereditary Representative about
 these Vetos;—with such demonstration, jingle and evolution, as
 may seem profitable and practicable. Sections have gone singly,
 and jingled and evolved: but if they all went, or great part of
 them, and there, planting their _Mai_ in these alarming
 circumstances, sounded the tocsin in their hearts? Among King’s Friends there can be but one opinion as to such a
 step: among Nation’s Friends there may be two. On the one hand,
 might it not by possibility scare away these unblessed Vetos?
 Private Patriots and even Legislative Deputies may have each his
 own opinion, or own no-opinion: but the hardest task falls
 evidently on Mayor Pétion and the Municipals, at once Patriots
 and Guardians of the public Tranquillity. Hushing the matter down
 with the one hand; tickling it up with the other! Mayor Pétion
 and Municipality may lean this way; Department-Directory with
 Procureur-Syndic Rœderer having a Feuillant tendency, may lean
 that. On the whole, each man must act according to his one
 opinion or to his two opinions; and all manner of influences,
 official representations cross one another in the foolishest way.
 Perhaps after all, the Project, desirable and yet not desirable,
 will dissipate itself, being run athwart by so many complexities;
 and coming to nothing? Not so: on the Twentieth morning of June, a large Tree of
 Liberty, Lombardy Poplar by kind, lies visibly tied on its car,
 in the Suburb-Antoine. Suburb Saint-Marceau too, in the uttermost
 South-East, and all that remote Oriental region, Pikemen and
 Pikewomen, National Guards, and the unarmed curious are
 gathering,—with the peaceablest intentions in the world. A
 tricolor Municipal arrives; speaks. Tush, it is all peaceable, we
 tell thee, in the way of Law: are not Petitions allowable, and
 the Patriotism of _Mais?_ The tricolor Municipal returns without
 effect: your Sansculottic rills continue flowing, combining into
 brooks: towards noontide, led by tall Santerre in blue uniform,
 by tall Saint-Huruge in white hat, it moves Westward, a
 respectable river, or complication of still-swelling rivers. What Processions have we not seen: _Corpus-Christi_ and Legendre
 waiting in Gig; Bones of Voltaire with bullock-chariots, and
 goadsmen in Roman Costume; Feasts of Château-Vieux and Simonneau;
 Gouvion Funerals, Rousseau Sham-Funerals, and the Baptism of
 Pétion-National-Pike! Nevertheless this Procession has a
 character of its own. Tricolor ribands streaming aloft from
 pike-heads; ironshod batons; and emblems not a few; among which,
 see specially these two, of the tragic and the untragic sort: a
 Bull’s Heart transfixed with iron, bearing this epigraph, “_Cœur
 d’Aristocrate_, Aristocrat’s Heart;” and, more striking still,
 properly the standard of the host, a pair of old Black Breeches
 (silk, they say), extended on cross-staff high overhead, with
 these memorable words: “_Tremblez tyrans, voilà les
 Sansculottes_, Tremble tyrants, here are the
 Sans-indispensables!” Also, the Procession trails two cannons. Scarfed tricolor Municipals do now again meet it, in the Quai
 Saint-Bernard; and plead earnestly, having called halt.
 Peaceable, ye virtuous tricolor Municipals, peaceable are we as
 the sucking dove. Behold our Tennis-Court _Mai_. Petition is
 legal; and as for arms, did not an august Legislative receive the
 so-called Eight Thousand in arms, Feuillants though they were?
 Our Pikes, are they not of National iron? Law is our father and
 mother, whom we will not dishonour; but Patriotism is our own
 soul. Peaceable, ye virtuous Municipals;—and on the whole,
 limited as to time! Stop we cannot; march ye with us.—The Black
 Breeches agitate themselves, impatient; the cannon-wheels
 grumble: the many-footed Host tramps on. How it reached the Salle de Manége, like an ever-waxing river;
 got admittance, after debate; read its Address; and defiled,
 dancing and _ça-ira_-ing, led by tall sonorous Santerre and tall
 sonorous Saint-Huruge: how it flowed, not now a waxing river but
 a shut Caspian lake, round all Precincts of the Tuileries; the
 front Patriot squeezed by the rearward, against barred iron
 Grates, like to have the life squeezed out of him, and looking
 too into the dread throat of cannon, for National Battalions
 stand ranked within: how tricolor Municipals ran assiduous, and
 Royalists with Tickets of Entry; and both Majesties sat in the
 interior surrounded by men in black: all this the human mind
 shall fancy for itself, or read in old Newspapers, and Syndic
 Rœderer’s _Chronicle of Fifty Days_.[472] Our _Mai_ is planted; if not in the Feuillants Terrace, whither
 is no ingate, then in the Garden of the Capuchins, as near as we
 could get. National Assembly has adjourned till the Evening
 Session: perhaps this shut lake, finding no ingate, will retire
 to its sources again; and disappear in peace? Alas, not yet:
 rearward still presses on; rearward knows little what pressure is
 in the front. One would wish at all events, were it possible, to
 have a word with his Majesty first!');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' The shadows fall longer, eastward; it is four o’clock: will his
 Majesty not come out? Hardly he! In that case, Commandant
 Santerre, Cattle-butcher Legendre, Patriot Huguenin with the
 tocsin in his heart; they, and others of authority, will enter
 _in_. Petition and request to wearied uncertain National Guard;
 louder and louder petition; backed by the rattle of our two
 cannons! The reluctant Grate opens: endless Sansculottic
 multitudes flood the stairs; knock at the wooden guardian of your
 privacy. Knocks, in such case, grow strokes, grow smashings: the
 wooden guardian flies in shivers. And now ensues a Scene over
 which the world has long wailed; and not unjustly; for a sorrier
 spectacle, of Incongruity fronting Incongruity, and as it were
 recognising themselves incongruous, and staring stupidly in each
 other’s face, the world seldom saw. King Louis, his door being beaten on, opens it; stands with free
 bosom; asking, ‘What do you want?’ The Sansculottic flood recoils
 awestruck; returns however, the rear pressing on the front, with
 cries of ‘Veto! Patriot Ministers! Remove Veto!’—which things,
 Louis valiantly answers, this is not the time to do, nor this the
 way to ask him to do. Honour what virtue is in a man. Louis does
 not want courage; he has even the higher kind called
 moral-courage, though only the passive half of that. His few
 National Grenadiers shuffle back with him, into the embrasure of
 a window: there he stands, with unimpeachable passivity, amid the
 shouldering and the braying; a spectacle to men. They hand him a
 Red Cap of Liberty; he sets it quietly on his head, forgets it
 there. He complains of thirst; half-drunk Rascality offers him a
 bottle, he drinks of it. ‘Sire, do not fear,’ says one of his
 Grenadiers. ‘Fear?’ answers Louis: ‘feel then,’ putting the man’s
 hand on his heart. So stands Majesty in Red woollen Cap; black
 Sansculottism weltering round him, far and wide, aimless, with
 in-articulate dissonance, with cries of ‘Veto! Patriot
 Ministers!’ For the space of three hours or more! The National Assembly is
 adjourned; tricolor Municipals avail almost nothing: Mayor Pétion
 tarries absent; Authority is none. The Queen with her Children
 and Sister Elizabeth, in tears and terror not for themselves
 only, are sitting behind barricaded tables and Grenadiers in an
 inner room. The Men in Black have all wisely disappeared. Blind
 lake of Sansculottism welters stagnant through the King’s
 Château, for the space of three hours. Nevertheless all things do end. Vergniaud arrives with
 Legislative Deputation, the Evening Session having now opened.
 Mayor Pétion has arrived; is haranguing, “lifted on the shoulders
 of two Grenadiers.” In this uneasy attitude and in others, at
 various places without and within, Mayor Pétion harangues; many
 men harangue: finally Commandant Santerre defiles; passes out,
 with his Sansculottism, by the opposite side of the Château.
 Passing through the room where the Queen, with an air of dignity
 and sorrowful resignation, sat among the tables and Grenadiers, a
 woman offers her too a Red Cap; she holds it in her hand, even
 puts it on the little Prince Royal. ‘Madame,’ said Santerre,
 ‘this People loves you more than you think.’[473]—About eight
 o’clock the Royal Family fall into each other’s arms amid
 “torrents of tears.” Unhappy Family! Who would not weep for it,
 were there not a whole world to be wept for? Thus has the Age of Chivalry gone, and that of Hunger come. Thus
 does all-needing Sansculottism look in the face of its _Roi_,
 Regulator, King or Ableman; and find that _he_ has nothing to
 give it. Thus do the two Parties, brought face to face after long
 centuries, stare stupidly at one another, _This, verily, am I;
 but, Good Heaven, is that Thou?_—and depart, not knowing what to
 make of it. And yet, Incongruities having recognised themselves
 to be incongruous, something must be made of it. The Fates know
 what. This is the world-famous Twentieth of June, more worthy to be
 called the _Procession of the Black Breeches_. With which, what
 we had to say of this First French biennial Parliament, and its
 products and activities, may perhaps fitly enough terminate.
 BOOK 2.VI.
 THE MARSEILLESE
 Chapter 2.6.I.
 Executive that does not act. How could your paralytic National Executive be put “in action,”
 in any measure, by such a Twentieth of June as this? Quite
 contrariwise: a large sympathy for Majesty so insulted arises
 every where; expresses itself in Addresses, Petitions, “Petition
 of the Twenty Thousand inhabitants of Paris,” and such like,
 among all Constitutional persons; a decided rallying round the
 Throne. Of which rallying it was thought King Louis might have made
 something. However, he does make nothing of it, or attempt to
 make; for indeed his views are lifted beyond domestic sympathy
 and rallying, over to Coblentz mainly: neither in itself is the
 same sympathy worth much. It is sympathy of men who believe still
 that the Constitution can march. Wherefore the old discord and
 ferment, of Feuillant sympathy for Royalty, and Jacobin sympathy
 for Fatherland, acting against each other from within; with
 terror of Coblentz and Brunswick acting from without:—this
 discord and ferment must hold on its course, till a catastrophe
 do ripen and come. One would think, especially as Brunswick is
 near marching, such catastrophe cannot now be distant. Busy, ye
 Twenty-five French Millions; ye foreign Potentates, minatory
 Emigrants, German drill-serjeants; each do what his hand findeth!
 Thou, O Reader, at such safe distance, wilt see what they make of
 it among them. Consider therefore this pitiable Twentieth of June as a futility;
 no catastrophe, rather a _catastasis_, or heightening. Do not its
 Black Breeches wave there, in the Historical Imagination, like a
 melancholy flag of distress; soliciting help, which no mortal can
 give? Soliciting pity, which thou wert hard-hearted not to give
 freely, to one and all! Other such flags, or what are called
 Occurrences, and black or bright symbolic Phenomena; will flit
 through the Historical Imagination: these, one after one, let us
 note, with extreme brevity. The first phenomenon is that of Lafayette at the Bar of the
 Assembly; after a week and day. Promptly, on hearing of this
 scandalous Twentieth of June, Lafayette has quitted his Command
 on the North Frontier, in better or worse order; and got hither,
 on the 28th, to repress the Jacobins: not by Letter now; but by
 oral Petition, and weight of character, face to face. The august
 Assembly finds the step questionable; invites him meanwhile to
 the honours of the sitting.[474] Other honour, or advantage,
 there unhappily came almost none; the Galleries all growling;
 fiery Isnard glooming; sharp Guadet not wanting in sarcasms. And out of doors, when the sitting is over, Sieur Resson, keeper
 of the Patriot _Café_ in these regions, hears in the street a
 hurly-burly; steps forth to look, he and his Patriot customers:
 it is Lafayette’s carriage, with a tumultuous escort of blue
 Grenadiers, Cannoneers, even Officers of the Line, hurrahing and
 capering round it. They make a pause opposite Sieur Resson’s
 door; wag their plumes at him; nay shake their fists, bellowing
 _À bas les Jacobins!_ but happily pass on without onslaught. They
 pass on, to plant a _Mai_ before the General’s door, and bully
 considerably. All which the Sieur Resson cannot but report with
 sorrow, that night, in the Mother Society.[475] But what no Sieur
 Resson nor Mother Society can do more than guess is this, That a
 council of rank Feuillants, your unabolished Staff of the Guard
 and who else has status and weight, is in these very moments
 privily deliberating at the General’s: Can we not put down the
 Jacobins by force? Next day, a Review shall be held, in the
 Tuileries Garden, of such as will turn out, and try. Alas, says
 Toulongeon, hardly a hundred turned out. Put it off till
 tomorrow, then, to give better warning. On the morrow, which is
 Saturday, there turn out “some thirty;” and depart shrugging
 their shoulders![476] Lafayette promptly takes carriage again;
 returns musing on many things. The dust of Paris is hardly off his wheels, the summer Sunday is
 still young, when Cordeliers in deputation pluck up that _Mai_ of
 his: before sunset, Patriots have burnt him in effigy. Louder
 doubt and louder rises, in Section, in National Assembly, as to
 the legality of such unbidden Anti-jacobin visit on the part of a
 General: doubt swelling and spreading all over France, for six
 weeks or so: with endless talk about usurping soldiers, about
 English Monk, nay about Cromwell: O thou pour
 _Grandison_-Cromwell!—What boots it? King Louis himself looked
 coldly on the enterprize: colossal Hero of two Worlds, having
 weighed himself in the balance, finds that he is become a
 gossamer Colossus, only some thirty turning out. In a like sense, and with a like issue, works our
 Department-Directory here at Paris; who, on the 6th of July, take
 upon them to suspend Mayor Pétion and Procureur Manuel from all
 civic functions, for their conduct, replete, as is alleged, with
 omissions and commissions, on that delicate Twentieth of June.
 Virtuous Pétion sees himself a kind of martyr, or pseudo-martyr,
 threatened with several things; drawls out due heroical
 lamentation; to which Patriot Paris and Patriot Legislative duly
 respond. King Louis and Mayor Pétion have already had an
 interview on that business of the Twentieth; an interview and
 dialogue, distinguished by frankness on both sides; ending on
 King Louis’s side with the words, ‘_Taisez-vous_, Hold your
 peace.’ For the rest, this of suspending our Mayor does seem a mistimed
 measure. By ill chance, it came out precisely on the day of that
 famous _Baiser de l’amourette_, or miraculous reconciliatory
 Delilah-Kiss, which we spoke of long ago. Which Delilah-Kiss was
 thereby quite hindered of effect. For now his Majesty has to
 write, almost that same night, asking a reconciled Assembly for
 advice! The reconciled Assembly will not advise; will not
 interfere. The King confirms the suspension; then perhaps, but
 not till then will the Assembly interfere, the noise of Patriot
 Paris getting loud. Whereby your Delilah-Kiss, such was the
 destiny of Parliament First, becomes a Philistine Battle! Nay there goes a word that as many as Thirty of our chief Patriot
 Senators are to be clapped in prison, by mittimus and indictment
 of Feuillant Justices, _Juges de Paix;_ who here in Paris were
 well capable of such a thing. It was but in May last that _Juge
 de Paix Larivière_, on complaint of Bertrand-Moleville touching
 that _Austrian Committee_, made bold to launch his mittimus
 against three heads of the Mountain, Deputies Bazire, Chabot,
 Merlin, the Cordelier Trio; summoning them to appear before
 _him_, and shew where that Austrian Committee was, or else suffer
 the consequences. Which mittimus the Trio, on their side, made
 bold to fling in the fire: and valiantly pleaded privilege of
 Parliament. So that, for his zeal without knowledge, poor Justice
 Larivière now sits in the prison of Orléans, waiting trial from
 the _Haute Cour_ there. Whose example, may it not deter other
 rash Justices; and so this word of the Thirty arrestments
 continue a word merely? But on the whole, though Lafayette weighed so light, and has had
 his _Mai_ plucked up, Official Feuillantism falters not a whit;
 but carries its head high, strong in the letter of the Law.
 Feuillants all of these men: a Feuillant Directory; founding on
 high character, and such like; with Duke de la Rochefoucault for
 President,—a thing which may prove dangerous for him! Dim now is
 the once bright Anglomania of these admired Noblemen. Duke de
 Liancourt offers, out of Normandy where he is Lord-Lieutenant,
 not only to receive his Majesty, thinking of flight thither, but
 to lend him money to enormous amounts. Sire, it is not a Revolt,
 it is a Revolution; and truly no rose-water one! Worthier
 Noblemen were not in France nor in Europe than those two: but the
 Time is crooked, quick-shifting, perverse; what straightest
 course will lead to any goal, in _it?_ Another phasis which we note, in these early July days, is that
 of certain thin streaks of Federate National Volunteers wending
 from various points towards Paris, to hold a new
 Federation-Festival, or Feast of Pikes, on the Fourteenth there.
 So has the National Assembly wished it, so has the Nation willed
 it. In this way, perhaps, may we still have our Patriot Camp in
 spite of _Veto_. For cannot these Fédérés, having celebrated
 their Feast of Pikes, march on to Soissons; and, there being
 drilled and regimented, rush to the Frontiers, or whither we
 like? Thus were the one _Veto_ cunningly eluded! As indeed the other _Veto_, about Priests, is also like to be
 eluded; and without much cunning. For Provincial Assemblies, in
 Calvados as one instance, are proceeding on their own strength to
 judge and banish Antinational Priests. Or still worse without
 Provincial Assembly, a desperate People, as at Bourdeaux, can
 “hang two of them on the Lanterne,” on the way towards
 judgment.[477] Pity for the spoken _Veto_, when it cannot become
 an acted one! It is true, some ghost of a War-minister, or Home-minister, for
 the time being, ghost whom we do not name, does write to
 Municipalities and King’s Commanders, that they shall, by all
 conceivable methods, obstruct this Federation, and even turn back
 the Fédérés by force of arms: a message which scatters mere
 doubt, paralysis and confusion; irritates the poor Legislature;
 reduces the Fédérés as we see, to thin streaks. But being
 questioned, this ghost and the other ghosts, What it is then that
 they propose to do for saving the country?—they answer, That they
 cannot tell; that indeed they for their part have, this morning,
 resigned in a body; and do now merely respectfully take leave of
 the helm altogether. With which words they rapidly walk out of
 the Hall, _sortent brusquement de la salle_, the “Galleries
 cheering loudly,” the poor Legislature sitting “for a good while
 in silence!”[478] Thus do Cabinet-ministers themselves, in
 extreme cases, strike work; one of the strangest omens. Other
 complete Cabinet-ministry there will not be; only fragments, and
 these changeful, which never get completed; spectral Apparitions
 that cannot so much as appear! King Louis writes that he now
 views this Federation Feast with approval; and will himself have
 the pleasure to take part in the same. And so these thin streaks of Fédérés wend Parisward through a
 paralytic France. Thin grim streaks; not thick joyful ranks, as
 of old to the first Feast of Pikes! No: these poor Federates
 march now towards Austria and Austrian Committee, towards
 jeopardy and forlorn hope; men of hard fortune and temper, not
 rich in the world’s goods. Municipalities, paralyzed by
 War-ministers, are shy of affording cash: it may be, your poor
 Federates cannot arm themselves, cannot march, till the
 Daughter-Society of the place open her pocket, and subscribe.
 There will not have arrived, at the set day, Three thousand of
 them in all. And yet, thin and feeble as these streaks of
 Federates seem, they are the only thing one discerns moving with
 any clearness of aim, in this strange scene. Angry buzz and
 simmer; uneasy tossing and moaning of a huge France, all
 enchanted, spell-bound by unmarching Constitution, into frightful
 conscious and unconscious Magnetic-sleep; which frightful
 Magnetic-sleep must now issue soon in one of two things: Death or
 Madness! The Fédérés carry mostly in their pocket some earnest
 cry and Petition, to have the “National Executive put in action;”
 or as a step towards that, to have the King’s _Déchéance_, King’s
 Forfeiture, or at least his Suspension, pronounced. They shall be
 welcome to the Legislative, to the Mother of Patriotism; and
 Paris will provide for their lodging. _Déchéance_, indeed: and, what next? A France spell-free, a
 Revolution saved; and any thing, and all things next! so answer
 grimly Danton and the unlimited Patriots, down deep in their
 subterranean region of Plot, whither they have now dived.
 _Déchéance_, answers Brissot with the limited: And if next the
 little Prince Royal were crowned, and some Regency of Girondins
 and recalled Patriot Ministry set over him? Alas, poor Brissot;
 looking, as indeed poor man does always, on the nearest morrow as
 his peaceable promised land; deciding what must reach to the
 world’s end, yet with an insight that reaches not beyond his own
 nose! Wiser are the unlimited subterranean Patriots, who with
 light for the hour itself, leave the rest to the gods. Or were it not, as we now stand, the probablest issue of all,
 that Brunswick, in Coblentz, just gathering his huge limbs
 towards him to rise, might arrive first; and stop both
 _Déchéance_, and theorizing on it? Brunswick is on the eve of
 marching; with Eighty Thousand, they say; fell Prussians,
 Hessians, feller Emigrants: a General of the Great Frederick,
 with such an Army. And our Armies? And our Generals? As for
 Lafayette, on whose late visit a Committee is sitting and all
 France is jarring and censuring, he seems readier to fight _us_
 than fight Brunswick. Lückner and Lafayette pretend to be
 interchanging corps, and are making movements; which Patriotism
 cannot understand. This only is very clear, that their corps go
 marching and shuttling, in the interior of the country; much
 nearer Paris than formerly! Lückner has ordered Dumouriez down to
 him, down from Maulde, and the Fortified Camp there. Which order
 the many-counselled Dumouriez, with the Austrians hanging close
 on him, he busy meanwhile training a few thousands to stand fire
 and be soldiers, declares that, come of it what will, he cannot
 obey.[479] Will a poor Legislative, therefore, sanction
 Dumouriez; who applies to it, “not knowing whether there is any
 War-ministry?” Or sanction Lückner and these Lafayette movements? The poor Legislative knows not what to do. It decrees, however,
 that the Staff of the Paris Guard, and indeed all such Staffs,
 for they are Feuillants mostly, shall be broken and replaced. It
 decrees earnestly in what manner one can declare that the
 _Country is in Danger_. And finally, on the 11th of July, the
 morrow of that day when the Ministry struck work, it decrees that
 _the Country be_, with all despatch, _declared in Danger_.
 Whereupon let the King sanction; let the Municipality take
 measures: if such Declaration will do service, _it_ need not
 fail. In Danger, truly, if ever Country was! Arise, O Country; or be
 trodden down to ignominious ruin! Nay, are not the chances a
 hundred to one that no rising of the Country will save it;
 Brunswick, the Emigrants, and Feudal Europe drawing nigh?
 Chapter 2.6.II.
 Let us march. But to our minds the notablest of all these moving phenomena, is
 that of Barbaroux’s “Six Hundred Marseillese who know how to
 die.” Prompt to the request of Barbaroux, the Marseilles Municipality
 has got these men together: on the fifth morning of July, the
 Townhall says, ‘_Marchez, abatez le Tyran_, March, strike down
 the Tyrant;’[480] and they, with grim appropriate ‘_Marchons_,’
 are marching. Long journey, doubtful errand; _Enfans de la
 Patrie_, may a good genius guide you! Their own wild heart and
 what faith it has will guide them: and is not that the monition
 of some genius, better or worse? Five Hundred and Seventeen able
 men, with Captains of fifties and tens; well armed all, musket on
 shoulder, sabre on thigh: nay they drive three pieces of cannon;
 for who knows what obstacles may occur? Municipalities there are,
 paralyzed by War-minister; Commandants with orders to stop even
 Federation Volunteers; good, when sound arguments will not open a
 Town-gate, if you have a petard to shiver it! They have left
 their sunny Phocean City and Sea-haven, with its bustle and its
 bloom: the thronging _Course_, with high-frondent Avenues, pitchy
 dockyards, almond and olive groves, orange trees on house-tops,
 and white glittering _bastides_ that crown the hills, are all
 behind them. They wend on their wild way, from the extremity of
 French land, through unknown cities, toward an unknown destiny;
 with a purpose that they know. Much wondering at this phenomenon, and how, in a peaceable
 trading City, so many householders or hearth-holders do severally
 fling down their crafts and industrial tools; gird themselves
 with weapons of war, and set out on a journey of six hundred
 miles to “strike down the tyrant,”—you search in all Historical
 Books, Pamphlets, and Newspapers, for some light on it: unhappily
 without effect. Rumour and Terror precede this march; which still
 echo on you; the march itself an unknown thing. Weber, in the
 back-stairs of the Tuileries, has understood that they were
 _Forçats_, Galley-slaves and mere scoundrels, these Marseillese;
 that, as they marched through Lyons, the people shut their
 shops;—also that the number of them was some Four _Thousand_.
 Equally vague is Blanc Gilli, who likewise murmurs about
 _Forçats_ and danger of plunder.[481] _Forçats_ they were not;
 neither was there plunder, or danger of it. Men of regular life,
 or of the best-filled purse, they could hardly be; the one thing
 needful in them was that they “knew how to die.” Friend
 Dampmartin saw them, with his own eyes, march “gradually” through
 his quarters at Villefranche in the Beaujolais: but saw in the
 vaguest manner; being indeed preoccupied, and himself minded for
 matching just then—across the Rhine. Deep was his astonishment to
 think of such a march, without appointment or arrangement,
 station or ration: for the rest it was “the same men he had seen
 formerly” in the troubles of the South; “perfectly civil;” though
 his soldiers could not be kept from talking a little with
 them.[482] So vague are all these; _Moniteur, Histoire Parlementaire_ are as
 good as silent: garrulous History, as is too usual, will say
 nothing where you most wish her to speak! If enlightened
 Curiosity ever get sight of the Marseilles Council-Books, will it
 not perhaps explore this strangest of Municipal procedures; and
 feel called to fish up what of the Biographies, creditable or
 discreditable, of these Five Hundred and Seventeen, the stream of
 Time has not yet irrevocably swallowed? As it is, these Marseillese remain inarticulate,
 undistinguishable in feature; a blackbrowed Mass, full of grim
 fire, who wend there, in the hot sultry weather: very singular to
 contemplate. They wend; amid the infinitude of doubt and dim
 peril; they not doubtful: Fate and Feudal Europe, having decided,
 come girdling in from without: they, having also decided, do
 march within. Dusty of face, with frugal refreshment, they plod
 onwards; unweariable, not to be turned aside. Such march will
 become famous. The Thought, which works voiceless in this
 blackbrowed mass, an inspired Tyrtæan Colonel, Rouget de Lille,
 whom the Earth still holds,[483] has translated into grim melody
 and rhythm; into his _Hymn_ or March _of the Marseillese:_
 luckiest musical-composition ever promulgated. The sound of which
 will make the blood tingle in men’s veins; and whole Armies and
 Assemblages will sing it, with eyes weeping and burning, with
 hearts defiant of Death, Despot and Devil. One sees well, these Marseillese will be too late for the
 Federation Feast. In fact, it is not Champ-de-Mars Oaths that
 they have in view. They have quite another feat to do: a
 paralytic National Executive to set in action. They must “strike
 down” whatsoever “Tyrant,” or Martyr-Fainéant, there may be who
 paralyzes it; strike and be struck; and on the whole prosper and
 know how to die.
 Chapter 2.6.III.
 Some Consolation to Mankind. Of the Federation Feast itself we shall say almost nothing. There
 are Tents pitched in the Champ-de-Mars; tent for National
 Assembly; tent for Hereditary Representative,—who indeed is there
 too early, and has to wait long in it. There are Eighty-three
 symbolical Departmental Trees-of-Liberty; trees and _mais_
 enough: beautifullest of all these is one huge _mai_, hung round
 with effete Scutcheons, Emblazonries and Genealogy-books; nay
 better still, with Lawyers’-bags, “_sacs de procédure:_” which
 shall be burnt. The Thirty seat-rows of that famed Slope are
 again full; we have a bright Sun; and all is marching,
 streamering and blaring: but what avails it? Virtuous Mayor
 Pétion, whom Feuillantism had suspended, was reinstated only last
 night, by Decree of the Assembly. Men’s humour is of the sourest.
 Men’s hats have on them, written in chalk, “_Vive Pétion;_” and
 even, “Pétion or Death, _Pétion ou la Mort_.” Poor Louis, who has waited till five o’clock before the Assembly
 would arrive, swears the National Oath this time, with a quilted
 cuirass under his waistcoat which will turn pistol-bullets.[484]
 Madame de Staël, from that Royal Tent, stretches out the neck in
 a kind of agony, lest the waving multitudes which receive him may
 not render him back alive. No cry of _Vive le Roi_ salutes the
 ear; cries only of _Vive Pétion; Pétion ou la Mort_. The National
 Solemnity is as it were huddled by; each cowering off almost
 before the evolutions are gone through. The very _Mai_ with its
 Scutcheons and Lawyers’-bags is forgotten, stands unburnt; till
 “certain Patriot Deputies,” called by the people, set a torch to
 it, by way of voluntary after-piece. Sadder Feast of Pikes no man
 ever saw. Mayor Pétion, named on hats, is at his zenith in this Federation;
 Lafayette again is close upon his nadir. Why does the stormbell
 of Saint-Roch speak out, next Saturday; why do the citizens shut
 their shops?[485] It is Sections defiling, it is fear of
 effervescence. Legislative Committee, long deliberating on
 Lafayette and that Anti-jacobin Visit of his, reports, this day,
 that there is “_not_ ground for Accusation!” Peace, ye Patriots,
 nevertheless; and let that tocsin cease: the Debate is not
 finished, nor the Report accepted; but Brissot, Isnard and the
 Mountain will sift it, and resift it, perhaps for some three
 weeks longer. So many bells, stormbells and noises do ring;—scarcely audible;
 one drowning the other. For example: in this same Lafayette
 tocsin, of Saturday, was there not withal some faint bob-minor,
 and Deputation of Legislative, ringing the Chevalier Paul Jones
 to his long rest; tocsin or dirge now all one to him! Not ten
 days hence Patriot Brissot, beshouted this day by the Patriot
 Galleries, shall find himself begroaned by them, on account of
 his limited Patriotism; nay pelted at while perorating, and “hit
 with two prunes.”[486] It is a distracted empty-sounding world;
 of bob-minors and bob-majors, of triumph and terror, of rise and
 fall! The more touching is this other Solemnity, which happens on the
 morrow of the Lafayette tocsin: Proclamation that the _Country is
 in Danger_. Not till the present Sunday could such Solemnity be.
 The Legislative decreed it almost a fortnight ago; but Royalty
 and the ghost of a Ministry held back as they could. Now however,
 on this Sunday, 22nd day of July 1792, it will hold back no
 longer; and the Solemnity in very deed is. Touching to behold!
 Municipality and Mayor have on their scarfs; cannon-salvo booms
 alarm from the Pont-Neuf, and single-gun at intervals all day.
 Guards are mounted, scarfed Notabilities, Halberdiers, and a
 Cavalcade; with streamers, emblematic flags; especially with one
 huge Flag, flapping mournfully: _Citoyens, la Patrie est en
 Danger_. They roll through the streets, with stern-sounding
 music, and slow rattle of hoofs: pausing at set stations, and
 with doleful blast of trumpet, singing out through Herald’s
 throat, what the Flag says to the eye: ‘Citizens, the Country is
 in Danger!’ Is there a man’s heart that hears it without a thrill? The
 many-voiced responsive hum or bellow of these multitudes is not
 of triumph; and yet it is a sound deeper than triumph. But when
 the long Cavalcade and Proclamation ended; and our huge Flag was
 fixed on the Pont Neuf, another like it on the Hôtel-de-Ville, to
 wave there till better days; and each Municipal sat in the centre
 of his Section, in a Tent raised in some open square, Tent
 surmounted with flags of _Patrie en Danger_, and topmost of all a
 Pike and _Bonnet Rouge;_ and, on two drums in front of him, there
 lay a plank-table, and on this an open Book, and a Clerk sat,
 like recording-angel, ready to write the Lists, or as we say to
 enlist! O, then, it seems, the very gods might have looked down
 on it. Young Patriotism, Culottic and Sansculottic, rushes
 forward emulous: That is my name; name, blood, and life, is all
 my Country’s; why have I nothing more! Youths of short stature
 weep that they are below size. Old men come forward, a son in
 each hand. Mothers themselves will grant the son of their
 travail; send him, though with tears. And the multitude bellows
 _Vive la Patrie_, far reverberating. And fire flashes in the eyes
 of men;—and at eventide, your Municipal returns to the Townhall,
 followed by his long train of volunteer Valour; hands in his
 List: says proudly, looking round. This is my day’s harvest.[487]
 They will march, on the morrow, to Soissons; small bundle holding
 all their chattels. So, with _Vive la Patrie, Vive la Liberté_, stone Paris
 reverberates like Ocean in his caves; day after day, Municipals
 enlisting in tricolor Tent; the Flag flapping on Pont Neuf and
 Townhall, _Citoyens, la Patrie est en Danger_. Some Ten thousand
 fighters, without discipline but full of heart, are on march in
 few days. The like is doing in every Town of France.—Consider
 therefore whether the Country will want defenders, had we but a
 National Executive? Let the Sections and Primary Assemblies, at
 any rate, become Permanent, and sit continually in Paris, and
 over France, by Legislative Decree dated Wednesday the 25th.[488] Mark contrariwise how, in these very hours, dated the 25th,
 Brunswick shakes himself “_s’ébranle_,” in Coblentz; and takes
 the road! Shakes himself indeed; one spoken word becomes such a
 shaking. Successive, simultaneous _dirl_ of thirty thousand
 muskets shouldered; prance and jingle of ten-thousand horsemen,
 fanfaronading Emigrants in the van; drum, kettle-drum; noise of
 weeping, swearing; and the immeasurable lumbering clank of
 baggage-waggons and camp-kettles that groan into motion: all this
 is Brunswick shaking himself; not without all this does the one
 man march, “covering a space of forty miles.” Still less without
 his Manifesto, dated, as we say, the 25th; a State-Paper worthy
 of attention!');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' By this Document, it would seem great things are in store for
 France. The universal French People shall now have permission to
 rally round Brunswick and his Emigrant Seigneurs; tyranny of a
 Jacobin Faction shall oppress them no more; but they shall
 return, and find favour with their own good King; who, by Royal
 Declaration (three years ago) of the Twenty-third of June, said
 that he would himself make them happy. As for National Assembly,
 and other Bodies of Men invested with some temporary shadow of
 authority, they are charged to maintain the King’s Cities and
 Strong Places intact, till Brunswick arrive to take delivery of
 them. Indeed, quick submission may extenuate many things; but to
 this end it must be quick. Any National Guard or other unmilitary
 person found resisting in arms shall be “treated as a traitor;”
 that is to say, hanged with promptitude. For the rest, if Paris,
 before Brunswick gets thither, offer any insult to the King: or,
 for example, suffer a faction to carry the King away elsewhither;
 in that case Paris shall be blasted asunder with cannon-shot and
 “military execution.” Likewise all other Cities, which may
 witness, and not resist to the uttermost, such forced-march of
 his Majesty, shall be blasted asunder; and Paris and every City
 of them, starting-place, course and goal of said sacrilegious
 forced-march, shall, as rubbish and smoking ruin, lie there for a
 sign. Such vengeance were indeed signal, “an _insigne
 vengeance:_”—O Brunswick, what words thou writest and blusterest!
 In this Paris, as in old Nineveh, are so many score thousands
 that know not the right hand from the left, and also much cattle.
 Shall the very milk-cows, hard-living cadgers’-asses, and poor
 little canary-birds die? Nor is Royal and Imperial Prussian-Austrian Declaration wanting:
 setting forth, in the amplest manner, their Sanssouci-Schonbrunn
 version of this whole French Revolution, since the first
 beginning of it; and with what grief these high heads have seen
 such things done under the Sun: however, “as some small
 consolation to mankind,”[489] they do now despatch Brunswick;
 regardless of expense, as one might say, of sacrifices on their
 own part; for is it not the first duty to console men? Serene Highnesses, who sit there protocolling and manifestoing,
 and consoling mankind! how were it if, for once in the thousand
 years, your parchments, formularies, and reasons of state were
 blown to the four winds; and Reality Sans-indispensables stared
 you, even you, in the face; and Mankind said for itself what the
 thing was that would console it?—
 Chapter 2.6.IV.
 Subterranean. But judge if there was comfort in this to the Sections all
 sitting permanent; deliberating how a National Executive could be
 put in action! High rises the response, not of cackling terror, but of crowing
 counter-defiance, and _Vive la Nation;_ young Valour streaming
 towards the Frontiers; _Patrie en Danger_ mutely beckoning on the
 Pont Neuf. Sections are busy, in their permanent Deep; and down,
 lower still, works unlimited Patriotism, seeking salvation in
 plot. Insurrection, you would say, becomes once more the
 sacredest of duties? Committee, self-chosen, is sitting at the
 Sign of the Golden Sun: Journalist Carra, Camille Desmoulins,
 Alsatian Westermann friend of Danton, American Fournier of
 Martinique;—a Committee not unknown to Mayor Pétion, who, as an
 official person, must sleep with one eye open. Not unknown to
 Procureur Manuel; least of all to Procureur-Substitute Danton!
 He, wrapped in darkness, being also official, bears it on his
 giant shoulder; cloudy invisible Atlas of the whole. Much is invisible; the very Jacobins have their reticences.
 Insurrection is to be: but when? This only we can discern, that
 such Fédérés as are not yet gone to Soissons, as indeed are not
 inclined to go yet, ‘for reasons,’ says the Jacobin President,
 ‘which it may be interesting not to state,’ have got a _Central
 Committee_ sitting close by, under the roof of the Mother Society
 herself. Also, what in such ferment and danger of effervescence
 is surely proper, the Forty-eight Sections have got their Central
 Committee; intended “for prompt communication.” To which Central
 Committee the Municipality, anxious to have it at hand, could not
 refuse an Apartment in the Hôtel-de-Ville. Singular City! For overhead of all this, there is the customary
 baking and brewing; Labour hammers and grinds. Frilled
 promenaders saunter under the trees; white-muslin promenaderess,
 in green parasol, leaning on your arm. Dogs dance, and shoeblacks
 polish, on that Pont Neuf itself, where Fatherland is in danger.
 So much goes its course; and yet the course of all things is nigh
 altering and ending. Look at that Tuileries and Tuileries Garden. Silent all as
 Sahara; none entering save by ticket! They shut their Gates,
 after the Day of the Black Breeches; a thing they had the liberty
 to do. However, the National Assembly grumbled something about
 Terrace of the Feuillants, how said Terrace lay contiguous to the
 back entrance to their Salle, and was partly _National Property;_
 and so now National Justice has stretched a Tricolor Riband
 athwart, by way of boundary-line, respected with splenetic
 strictness by all Patriots. It hangs there that Tricolor
 boundary-line; carries “satirical inscriptions on cards,”
 generally in verse; and all beyond this is called _Coblentz_, and
 remains vacant; silent, as a fateful Golgotha; sunshine and
 umbrage alternating on it in vain. Fateful Circuit; what hope can
 dwell in it? Mysterious Tickets of Entry introduce themselves;
 speak of Insurrection very imminent. Rivarol’s Staff of Genius
 had better purchase blunderbusses; Grenadier bonnets, red Swiss
 uniforms may be useful. Insurrection will come; but likewise will
 it not be met? Staved off, one may hope, till Brunswick arrive? But consider withal if the Bourne-stones and Portable chairs
 remain silent; if the Herald’s College of Bill-Stickers sleep!
 Louvet’s _Sentinel_ warns gratis on all walls; Sulleau is busy:
 _People’s-Friend_ Marat and _King’s-Friend_ Royou croak and
 counter-croak. For the man Marat, though long hidden since that
 Champ-de-Mars Massacre, is still alive. He has lain, who knows in
 what Cellars; perhaps in Legendre’s; fed by a steak of Legendre’s
 killing: but, since April, the bull-frog voice of him sounds
 again; hoarsest of earthly cries. For the present, black terror
 haunts him: O brave Barbaroux wilt thou not smuggle me to
 Marseilles, “disguised as a jockey?”[490] In Palais-Royal and all
 public places, as we read, there is sharp activity; private
 individuals haranguing that Valour may enlist; haranguing that
 the Executive may be put in action. Royalist journals ought to be
 solemnly burnt: argument thereupon; debates which generally end
 in single-stick, _coups de cannes_.[491] Or think of this; the
 hour midnight; place Salle de Manége; august Assembly just
 adjourning: “Citizens of both sexes enter in a rush exclaiming,
 _Vengeance: they are poisoning our Brothers;_”—baking
 brayed-glass among their bread at Soissons! Vergniaud has to
 speak soothing words, How Commissioners are already sent to
 investigate this brayed-glass, and do what is needful therein:
 till the rush of Citizens “makes profound silence:” and goes home
 to its bed. Such is Paris; the heart of a France like to it. Preternatural
 suspicion, doubt, disquietude, nameless anticipation, from shore
 to shore:—and those blackbrowed Marseillese, marching, dusty,
 unwearied, through the midst of it; not doubtful they. Marching
 to the grim music of their hearts, they consume continually the
 long road, these three weeks and more; heralded by Terror and
 Rumour. The Brest Fédérés arrive on the 26th; through hurrahing
 streets. Determined men are these also, bearing or not bearing
 the Sacred Pikes of Château-Vieux; and on the whole decidedly
 disinclined for Soissons as yet. Surely the Marseillese Brethren
 do draw nigher all days.
 Chapter 2.6.V.
 At Dinner. It was a bright day for Charenton, that 29th of the month, when
 the Marseillese Brethren actually came in sight. Barbaroux,
 Santerre and Patriots have gone out to meet the grim Wayfarers.
 Patriot clasps dusty Patriot to his bosom; there is footwashing
 and refection: “dinner of twelve hundred covers at the Blue Dial,
 _Cadran Bleu;_” and deep interior consultation, that one wots not
 of.[492] Consultation indeed which comes to little; for Santerre,
 with an open purse, with a loud voice, has almost no head. Here
 however we repose this night: on the morrow is public entry into
 Paris. On which public entry the Day-Historians, _Diurnalists_, or
 Journalists as they call themselves, have preserved record
 enough. How Saint-Antoine male and female, and Paris generally,
 gave brotherly welcome, with bravo and hand-clapping, in crowded
 streets; and all passed in the peaceablest manner;—except it
 might be our Marseillese pointed out here and there a
 riband-cockade, and beckoned that it should be snatched away, and
 exchanged for a wool one; which was done. How the Mother Society
 in a body has come as far as the Bastille-ground, to embrace you.
 How you then wend onwards, triumphant, to the Townhall, to be
 embraced by Mayor Pétion; to put down your muskets in the
 Barracks of Nouvelle France, not far off;—then towards the
 appointed Tavern in the Champs Elysées to enjoy a frugal Patriot
 repast.[493] Of all which the indignant Tuileries may, by its Tickets of
 Entry, have warning. Red Swiss look doubly sharp to their
 Château-Grates;—though surely there is no danger? Blue Grenadiers
 of the Filles-Saint-Thomas Section are on duty there this day:
 men of Agio, as we have seen; with stuffed purses,
 riband-cockades; among whom serves Weber. A party of these
 latter, with Captains, with sundry Feuillant Notabilities, Moreau
 de Saint-Méry of the three thousand orders, and others, have been
 dining, much more respectably, in a Tavern hard by. They have
 dined, and are now drinking Loyal-Patriotic toasts; while the
 Marseillese, _National_-Patriotic merely, are about sitting down
 to their frugal covers of delf. How it happened remains to this
 day undemonstrable: but the external fact is, certain of these
 Filles-Saint-Thomas Grenadiers do issue from their Tavern;
 perhaps touched, surely not yet muddled with any liquor they have
 had;—issue in the professed intention of testifying to the
 Marseillese, or to the multitude of Paris Patriots who stroll in
 these spaces, That they, the Filles-Saint-Thomas men, if well
 seen into, are not a whit less Patriotic than any other class of
 men whatever. It was a rash errand! For how can the strolling multitudes credit
 such a thing; or do other indeed than hoot at it, provoking, and
 provoked;—till Grenadier sabres stir in the scabbard, and a sharp
 shriek rises: ‘_À nous Marseillais_, Help Marseillese!’ Quick as
 lightning, for the frugal repast is not yet served, that
 Marseillese Tavern flings itself open: by door, by window;
 running, bounding, vault forth the Five hundred and Seventeen
 undined Patriots; and, sabre flashing from thigh, are on the
 scene of controversy. Will ye parley, ye Grenadier Captains and
 official Persons; “with faces grown suddenly pale,” the Deponents
 say?[494] Advisabler were instant moderately swift retreat! The
 Filles-Saint-Thomas retreat, back foremost; then, alas, face
 foremost, at treble-quick time; the Marseillese, according to a
 Deponent, ‘clearing the fences and ditches after them like lions:
 Messieurs, it was an imposing spectacle.’ Thus they retreat, the Marseillese following. Swift and swifter,
 towards the Tuileries: where the Drawbridge receives the bulk of
 the fugitives; and, then suddenly drawn up, saves them; or else
 the green mud of the Ditch does it. The bulk of them; not all;
 ah, no! Moreau de Saint-Méry for example, being too fat, could
 not fly fast; he got a stroke, _flat_-stroke only, over the
 shoulder-blades, and fell prone;—and disappears there from the
 History of the Revolution. Cuts also there were, pricks in the
 posterior fleshy parts; much rending of skirts, and other
 discrepant waste. But poor Sub-lieutenant Duhamel, innocent
 Change-broker, what a lot for him! He turned on his pursuer, or
 pursuers, with a pistol; he fired and missed; drew a second
 pistol, and again fired and missed; then ran: unhappily in vain.
 In the Rue Saint-Florentin, they clutched him; thrust him
 through, in red rage: that was the end of the New Era, and of all
 Eras, to poor Duhamel. Pacific readers can fancy what sort of grace-before-meat this was
 to frugal Patriotism. Also how the Battalion of the
 Filles-Saint-Thomas “drew out in arms,” luckily without further
 result; how there was accusation at the Bar of the Assembly, and
 counter-accusation and defence; Marseillese challenging the
 sentence of free jury court,—which never got to a decision. We
 ask rather, What the upshot of all these distracted wildly
 accumulating things may, by probability, be? Some upshot; and the
 time draws nigh! Busy are Central Committees, of Fédérés at the
 Jacobins Church, of Sections at the Townhall; Reunion of Carra,
 Camille and Company at the Golden Sun. Busy: like submarine
 deities, or call them mud-gods, working there in the deep murk of
 waters: till the thing be ready. And how your National Assembly, like a ship waterlogged,
 helmless, lies tumbling; the Galleries, of shrill Women, of
 Fédérés with sabres, bellowing down on it, not unfrightful;—and
 waits where the waves of chance may please to strand it;
 suspicious, nay on the Left side, conscious, what submarine
 Explosion is meanwhile a-charging! Petition for King’s Forfeiture
 rises often there: Petition from Paris Section, from Provincial
 Patriot Towns; From Alencon, Briancon, and “the Traders at the
 Fair of Beaucaire.” Or what of these? On the 3rd of August, Mayor
 Pétion and the Municipality come petitioning for Forfeiture: they
 openly, in their tricolor Municipal scarfs. Forfeiture is what
 all Patriots now want and expect. All Brissotins want Forfeiture;
 with the little Prince Royal for King, and us for Protector over
 him. Emphatic Fédérés asks the legislature: ‘Can you save us, or
 not?’ Forty-seven Sections have agreed to Forfeiture; only that
 of the Filles-Saint-Thomas pretending to disagree. Nay Section
 Mauconseil declares Forfeiture to be, properly speaking, come;
 Mauconseil for one “does from this day,” the last of July, “cease
 allegiance to Louis,” and take minute of the same before all men.
 A thing blamed aloud; but which will be praised aloud; and the
 name _Mauconseil_, of Ill-counsel, be thenceforth changed to
 _Bonconseil_, of Good-counsel. President Danton, in the Cordeliers Section, does another thing:
 invites all Passive Citizens to take place among the Active in
 Section-business, one peril threatening all. Thus he, though an
 official person; cloudy Atlas of the whole. Likewise he manages
 to have that blackbrowed Battalion of Marseillese shifted to new
 Barracks, in his own region of the remote South-East. Sleek
 Chaumette, cruel Billaud, Deputy Chabot the Disfrocked, Huguenin
 with the tocsin in his heart, will welcome them there. Wherefore,
 again and again: ‘O Legislators, can you save us or not?’ Poor
 Legislators; with their Legislature waterlogged, volcanic
 Explosion charging under it! Forfeiture shall be debated on the
 ninth day of August; that miserable business of Lafayette may be
 expected to terminate on the eighth. Or will the humane Reader glance into the Levee-day of Sunday the
 fifth? The last Levee! Not for a long time, “never,” says
 Bertrand-Moleville, had a Levee been so brilliant, at least so
 crowded. A sad presaging interest sat on every face; Bertrand’s
 own eyes were filled with tears. For, indeed, outside of that
 Tricolor Riband on the Feuillants Terrace, Legislature is
 debating, Sections are defiling, all Paris is astir this very
 Sunday, demanding _Déchéance_.[495] Here, however, within the
 riband, a grand proposal is on foot, for the hundredth time, of
 carrying his Majesty to Rouen and the Castle of Gaillon. Swiss at
 Courbevoye are in readiness; much is ready; Majesty himself seems
 almost ready. Nevertheless, for the hundredth time, Majesty, when
 near the point of action, draws back; writes, after one has
 waited, palpitating, an endless summer day, that “he has reason
 to believe the Insurrection is not so ripe as you suppose.”
 Whereat Bertrand-Moleville breaks forth “into extremity at one of
 spleen and despair, _d’humeur et de désespoir_.”[496]
 Chapter 2.6.VI.
 The Steeples at Midnight. For, in truth, the Insurrection is just about ripe. Thursday is
 the ninth of the month August: if Forfeiture be not pronounced by
 the Legislature that day, we must pronounce it ourselves. Legislature? A poor waterlogged Legislature can pronounce
 nothing. On Wednesday the eighth, after endless oratory once
 again, they cannot even pronounce Accusation again Lafayette; but
 absolve him,—hear it, Patriotism!—by a majority of two to one.
 Patriotism hears it; Patriotism, hounded on by Prussian Terror,
 by Preternatural Suspicion, roars tumultuous round the Salle de
 Manége, all day; insults many leading Deputies, of the absolvent
 Right-side; nay chases them, collars them with loud menace:
 Deputy Vaublanc, and others of the like, are glad to take refuge
 in Guardhouses, and escape by the back window. And so, next day,
 there is infinite complaint; Letter after Letter from insulted
 Deputy; mere complaint, debate and self-cancelling jargon: the
 sun of Thursday sets like the others, and no Forfeiture
 pronounced. Wherefore in fine, To your tents, O Israel! The Mother-Society ceases speaking; groups cease haranguing:
 Patriots, with closed lips now, “take one another’s arm;” walk
 off, in rows, two and two, at a brisk business-pace; and vanish
 afar in the obscure places of the East.[497] Santerre is ready;
 or we will make him ready. Forty-seven of the Forty-eight
 Sections are ready; nay Filles-Saint-Thomas itself turns up the
 Jacobin side of it, turns down the Feuillant side of it, and is
 ready too. Let the unlimited Patriot look to his weapon, be it
 pike, be it firelock; and the Brest brethren, above all, the
 blackbrowed Marseillese prepare themselves for the extreme hour!
 Syndic Rœderer knows, and laments or not as the issue may turn,
 that “five thousand ball-cartridges, within these few days, have
 been distributed to Fédérés, at the Hôtel-de-Ville.”[498] And ye likewise, gallant gentlemen, defenders of Royalty, crowd
 ye on your side to the Tuileries. Not to a Levee: no, to a
 Couchée: where much will be put to bed. Your Tickets of Entry are
 needful; needfuller your blunderbusses!—They come and crowd, like
 gallant men who also know how to die: old Maillé the Camp-Marshal
 has come, his eyes gleaming once again, though dimmed by the
 rheum of almost four-score years. Courage, Brothers! We have a
 thousand red Swiss; men stanch of heart, steadfast as the granite
 of their Alps. National Grenadiers are at least friends of Order;
 Commandant Mandat breathes loyal ardour, will ‘answer for it on
 his head.’ Mandat will, and his Staff; for the Staff, though
 there stands a doom and Decree to that effect, is happily never
 yet dissolved. Commandant Mandat has corresponded with Mayor Pétion; carries a
 written Order from him these three days, to repel force by force.
 A squadron on the Pont Neuf with cannon shall turn back these
 Marseillese coming across the River: a squadron at the Townhall
 shall cut Saint-Antoine in two, “as it issues from the Arcade
 Saint-Jean;” drive one half back to the obscure East, drive the
 other half forward through “the Wickets of the Louvre.” Squadrons
 not a few, and mounted squadrons; squadrons in the Palais Royal,
 in the Place Vendôme: all these shall charge, at the right
 moment; sweep this street, and then sweep that. Some new
 Twentieth of June we shall have; only still more ineffectual? Or
 probably the Insurrection will not dare to rise at all? Mandat’s
 Squadrons, Horse-Gendarmerie and blue Guards march, clattering,
 tramping; Mandat’s Cannoneers rumble. Under cloud of night; to
 the sound of his _générale_, which begins drumming when men
 should go to bed. It is the 9th night of August, 1792. On the other hand, the Forty-eight Sections correspond by swift
 messengers; are choosing each their “three Delegates with full
 powers.” Syndic Rœderer, Mayor Pétion are sent for to the
 Tuileries: courageous Legislators, when the drum beats danger,
 should repair to their Salle. Demoiselle Théroigne has on her
 grenadier-bonnet, short-skirted riding-habit; two pistols garnish
 her small waist, and sabre hangs in baldric by her side. Such a game is playing in this Paris Pandemonium, or City of All
 the Devils!—And yet the Night, as Mayor Pétion walks here in the
 Tuileries Garden, “is beautiful and calm;” Orion and the Pleiades
 glitter down quite serene. Pétion has come forth, the “heat”
 inside was so oppressive.[499] Indeed, his Majesty’s reception of
 him was of the roughest; as it well might be. And now there is no
 outgate; Mandat’s blue Squadrons turn you back at every Grate;
 nay the Filles-Saint-Thomas Grenadiers give themselves liberties
 of tongue, How a virtuous Mayor “shall pay for it, if there be
 mischief,” and the like; though others again are full of
 civility. Surely if any man in France is in straights this night,
 it is Mayor Pétion: bound, under pain of death, one may say, to
 smile dexterously with the one side of his face, and weep with
 the other;—death if he do it not dexterously enough! Not till
 four in the morning does a National Assembly, hearing of his
 plight, summon him over “to give account of Paris;” of which he
 knows nothing: whereby however he shall get home to bed, and only
 his gilt coach be left. Scarcely less delicate is Syndic
 Rœderer’s task; who must wait whether he will lament or not, till
 he see the issue. Janus Bifrons, or _Mr. Facing-both-ways_, as
 vernacular Bunyan has it! They walk there, in the meanwhile,
 these two Januses, with others of the like double conformation;
 and “talk of indifferent matters.” Rœderer, from time to time, steps in; to listen, to speak; to
 send for the Department-Directory itself, he their Procureur
 Syndic not seeing how to act. The Apartments are all crowded;
 some seven hundred gentlemen in black elbowing, bustling; red
 Swiss standing like rocks; ghost, or partial-ghost of a Ministry,
 with Rœderer and advisers, hovering round their Majesties; old
 Marshall Maillé kneeling at the King’s feet, to say, He and these
 gallant gentlemen are come to die for him. List! through the
 placid midnight; clang of the distant stormbell! So, in very
 sooth; steeple after steeple takes up the wondrous tale. Black
 Courtiers listen at the windows, opened for air; discriminate the
 steeple-bells:[500] this is the tocsin of Saint-Roch; that again,
 is it not Saint-Jacques, named _de la Boucherie?_ Yes, Messieurs!
 Or even Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois, hear ye _it_ not? The same
 metal that rang storm, two hundred and twenty years ago; but by a
 Majesty’s order then; on Saint-Bartholomew’s Eve[501]—So go the
 steeple-bells; which Courtiers can discriminate. Nay, meseems,
 there is the Townhall itself; we know it by its sound! Yes,
 Friends, that is the Townhall; discoursing _so_, to the Night.
 Miraculously; by miraculous metal-tongue and man’s arm: Marat
 himself, if you knew it, is pulling at the rope there! Marat is
 pulling; Robespierre lies deep, invisible for the next forty
 hours; and some men have heart, and some have as good as none,
 and not even frenzy will give them any. What struggling confusion, as the issue slowly draws on; and the
 doubtful Hour, with pain and blind struggle, brings forth its
 Certainty, never to be abolished!—The Full-power Delegates, three
 from each Section, a Hundred and forty-four in all, got gathered
 at the Townhall, about midnight. Mandat’s Squadron, stationed
 there, did not hinder their entering: are they not the “Central
 Committee of the Sections” who sit here usually; though in
 greater number tonight? They are there: presided by Confusion,
 Irresolution, and the Clack of Tongues. Swift scouts fly; Rumour
 buzzes, of black Courtiers, red Swiss, of Mandat and his
 Squadrons that shall charge. Better put off the Insurrection?
 Yes, put it off. Ha, hark! Saint-Antoine booming out eloquent
 tocsin, of its own accord!—Friends, no: ye cannot put off the
 Insurrection; but must put it on, and live with it, or die with
 it. Swift now, therefore: let these actual Old Municipals, on sight
 of the Full-powers, and mandate of the Sovereign elective People,
 lay down their functions; and this New Hundred and forty-four
 take them up! Will ye nill ye, worthy Old Municipals, go ye must.
 Nay is it not a happiness for many a Municipal that he can wash
 his hands of such a business; and sit there paralyzed,
 unaccountable, till the Hour do bring forth; or even go home to
 his night’s rest?[502] Two only of the Old, or at most three, we
 retain Mayor Pétion, for the present walking in the Tuileries;
 Procureur Manuel; Procureur Substitute Danton, invisible Atlas of
 the whole. And so, with our Hundred and forty-four, among whom
 are a Tocsin-Huguenin, a Billaud, a Chaumette; and
 Editor-Talliens, and Fabre d’Eglantines, Sergents, Panises; and
 in brief, either emergent, or else emerged and full-blown, the
 entire Flower of unlimited Patriotism: have we not, as by magic,
 made a New Municipality; ready to act in the unlimited manner;
 and declare itself roundly, “in a State of Insurrection!”—First
 of all, then, be Commandant Mandat sent for, with that
 Mayor’s-Order of his; also let the New Municipals visit those
 Squadrons that were to charge; and let the stormbell ring its
 loudest;—and, on the whole, Forward, ye Hundred and forty-four;
 retreat is now none for you! Reader, fancy not, in thy languid way, that Insurrection is easy.
 Insurrection is difficult: each individual uncertain even of his
 next neighbour; totally uncertain of his distant neighbours, what
 strength is with him, what strength is against him; certain only
 that, in case of failure, his individual portion is the gallows!
 Eight hundred thousand heads, and in each of them a separate
 estimate of these uncertainties, a separate theorem of action
 conformable to that: out of so many uncertainties, does the
 certainty, and inevitable net-result never to be abolished, go
 on, at all moments, bodying itself forth;—leading thee also
 towards civic-crowns or an ignominious noose. Could the Reader take an Asmodeus’s Flight, and waving open all
 roofs and privacies, look down from the Tower of Notre Dame, what
 a Paris were it! Of treble-voice whimperings or vehemence, of
 bass-voice growlings, dubitations; Courage screwing itself to
 desperate defiance; Cowardice trembling silent within barred
 doors;—and all round, Dulness calmly snoring; for much Dulness,
 flung on its mattresses, always sleeps. O, between the clangour
 of these high-storming tocsins and that snore of Dulness, what a
 gamut: of trepidation, excitation, desperation; and above it mere
 Doubt, Danger, Atropos and Nox! Fighters of this section draw out; hear that the next Section
 does not; and thereupon draw in. Saint-Antoine, on this side the
 River, is uncertain of Saint-Marceau on that. Steady only is the
 snore of Dulness, are the Six Hundred Marseillese that know how
 to die! Mandat, twice summoned to the Townhall, has not come.
 Scouts fly incessant, in distracted haste; and the
 many-whispering voices of Rumour. Théroigne and unofficial
 Patriots flit, dim-visible, exploratory, far and wide; like
 Night-birds on the wing. Of Nationals some Three thousand have
 followed Mandat and his _générale;_ the rest follow each his own
 theorem of the uncertainties: theorem, that one should march
 rather with Saint-Antoine; innumerable theorems, that in such a
 case the wholesomest were _sleep_. And so the drums beat, in made
 fits, and the stormbells peal. Saint-Antoine itself does but draw
 out and draw in; Commandant Santerre, over there, cannot believe
 that the Marseillese and Saint Marceau will march. Thou laggard
 sonorous Beer-vat, with the loud voice and timber head, is it
 time now to palter? Alsatian Westermann clutches him by the
 throat with drawn sabre: whereupon the Timber-headed believes. In
 this manner wanes the slow night; amid fret, uncertainty and
 tocsin; all men’s humour rising to the hysterical pitch; and
 nothing done. However, Mandat, on the third summons does come;—come, unguarded;
 astonished to find the Municipality _new_. They question him
 straitly on that Mayor’s-Order to resist force by force; on that
 strategic scheme of cutting Saint-Antoine in two halves: he
 answers what he can: they think it were right to send this
 strategic National Commandant to the Abbaye Prison, and let a
 Court of Law decide on him. Alas, a Court of Law, not Book-Law
 but primeval Club-Law, crowds and jostles out of doors; all
 fretted to the hysterical pitch; cruel as Fear, blind as the
 Night: such Court of Law, and no other, clutches poor Mandat from
 his constables; beats him down, massacres him, on the steps of
 the Townhall. Look to it, ye new Municipals; ye People, in a
 state of Insurrection! Blood is shed, blood must be answered
 for;—alas, in such hysterical humour, more blood will flow: for
 it is as with the Tiger in that; he has only to begin. Seventeen Individuals have been seized in the Champs Elysées, by
 exploratory Patriotism; they flitting dim-visible, by it flitting
 dim-visible. Ye have pistols, rapiers, ye Seventeen? One of those
 accursed “false Patrols;” that go marauding, with Anti-National
 intent; seeking what they can spy, what they can spill! The
 Seventeen are carried to the nearest Guard-house; eleven of them
 escape by back passages. ‘How is this?’ Demoiselle Théroigne
 appears at the front entrance, with sabre, pistols, and a train;
 denounces treasonous connivance; demands, seizes, the remaining
 six, that the justice of the People be not trifled with. Of which
 six two more escape in the whirl and debate of the Club-Law
 Court; the last unhappy Four are massacred, as Mandat was: Two
 Ex-Bodyguards; one dissipated Abbé; one Royalist Pamphleteer,
 Sulleau, known to us by name, Able Editor, and wit of all work.
 Poor Sulleau: his _Acts of the Apostles_, and brisk
 Placard-Journals (for he was an able man) come to _Finis_, in
 this manner; and questionable jesting issues suddenly in horrid
 earnest! Such doings usher in the dawn of the Tenth of August,
 1792.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Or think what a night the poor National Assembly has had: sitting
 there, “in great paucity,” attempting to debate;—quivering and
 shivering; pointing towards all the thirty-two azimuths at once,
 as the magnet-needle does when thunderstorm is in the air! If the
 Insurrection come? If it come, and fail? Alas, in that case, may
 not black Courtiers, with blunderbusses, red Swiss with bayonets
 rush over, flushed with victory, and ask us: Thou undefinable,
 waterlogged, self-distractive, self-destructive Legislative, what
 dost thou here _unsunk?_—Or figure the poor National Guards,
 bivouacking “in temporary tents” there; or standing ranked,
 shifting from leg to leg, all through the weary night; New
 tricolor Municipals ordering one thing, old Mandat Captains
 ordering another! Procureur Manuel has ordered the cannons to be
 withdrawn from the Pont Neuf; none ventured to disobey him. It
 seemed certain, then, the old Staff so long doomed has finally
 been dissolved, in these hours; and Mandat is not our Commandant
 now, but Santerre? Yes, friends: Santerre henceforth,—surely
 Mandat no more! The Squadrons that were to charge see nothing
 certain, except that they are cold, hungry, worn down with
 watching; that it were sad to slay French brothers; sadder to be
 slain by them. Without the Tuileries Circuit, and within it, sour
 uncertain humour sways these men: only the red Swiss stand
 steadfast. Them their officers refresh now with a slight wetting
 of brandy; wherein the Nationals, too far gone for brandy, refuse
 to participate. King Louis meanwhile had laid him down for a little sleep: his
 wig when he reappeared had lost the powder on one side.[503] Old
 Marshal Maillé and the gentlemen in black rise always in spirits,
 as the Insurrection does not rise: there goes a witty saying now,
 ‘_Le tocsin ne rend pas_.’ The tocsin, like a dry milk-cow, does
 not yield. For the rest, could one not proclaim Martial Law? Not
 easily; for now, it seems, Mayor Pétion is gone. On the other
 hand, our Interim Commandant, poor Mandat being off, “to the
 Hôtel-de-Ville,” complains that so many Courtiers in black
 encumber the service, are an eyesorrow to the National Guards. To
 which her Majesty answers with emphasis, That they will obey all,
 will suffer all, that they are sure men these. And so the yellow lamplight dies out in the gray of morning, in
 the King’s Palace, over such a scene. Scene of jostling,
 elbowing, of confusion, and indeed conclusion, for the thing is
 about to end. Rœderer and spectral Ministers jostle in the press;
 consult, in side cabinets, with one or with both Majesties.
 Sister Elizabeth takes the Queen to the window: ‘Sister, see what
 a beautiful sunrise,’ right over the Jacobins church and that
 quarter! How happy if the tocsin did not yield! But Mandat
 returns not; Pétion is gone: much hangs wavering in the invisible
 Balance. About five o’clock, there rises from the Garden a kind
 of sound; as of a shout to which had become a howl, and instead
 of _Vive le Roi_ were ending in _Vive la Nation_. ‘_Mon Dieu!_’
 ejaculates a spectral Minister, ‘what is he doing down there?’
 For it is his Majesty, gone down with old Marshal Maillé to
 review the troops; and the nearest companies of them answer _so_.
 Her Majesty bursts into a stream of tears. Yet on stepping from
 the cabinet her eyes are dry and calm, her look is even cheerful.
 “The Austrian lip, and the aquiline nose, fuller than usual, gave
 to her countenance,” says Peltier,[504] “something of Majesty,
 which they that did not see her in these moments cannot well have
 an idea of.” O thou Theresa’s Daughter! King Louis enters, much blown with the fatigue; but for the rest
 with his old air of indifference. Of all hopes now surely the
 joyfullest were, that the tocsin did not yield.
 Chapter 2.6.VII.
 The Swiss. Unhappy Friends, the tocsin does yield, has yielded! Lo ye, how
 with the first sun-rays its Ocean-tide, of pikes and fusils,
 flows glittering from the far East;—immeasurable; born of the
 Night! They march there, the grim host; Saint-Antoine on this
 side of the River; Saint-Marceau on that, the blackbrowed
 Marseillese in the van. With hum, and grim murmur, far-heard;
 like the Ocean-tide, as we say: drawn up, as if by Luna and
 Influences, from the great Deep of Waters, they roll gleaming on;
 no King, Canute or Louis, can bid them roll back. Wide-eddying
 side-currents, of onlookers, roll hither and thither, unarmed,
 not voiceless; they, the steel host, roll on. New-Commandant
 Santerre, indeed, has taken seat at the Townhall; rests there, in
 his half-way-house. Alsatian Westermann, with flashing sabre,
 does not rest; nor the Sections, nor the Marseillese, nor
 Demoiselle Théroigne; but roll continually on. And now, where are Mandat’s Squadrons that were to charge? Not a
 Squadron of them stirs: or they stir in the wrong direction, out
 of the way; their officers glad that they will even do that. It
 is to this hour uncertain whether the Squadron on the Pont Neuf
 made the shadow of resistance, or did not make the shadow:
 enough, the blackbrowed Marseillese, and Saint-Marceau following
 them, do cross without let; do cross, in sure hope now of
 Saint-Antoine and the rest; do billow on, towards the Tuileries,
 where their errand is. The Tuileries, at sound of them, rustles
 responsive: the red Swiss look to their priming; Courtiers in
 black draw their blunderbusses, rapiers, poniards, some have even
 fire-shovels; every man his weapon of war. Judge if, in these circumstances, Syndic Rœderer felt easy! Will
 the kind Heavens open no middle-course of refuge for a poor
 Syndic who halts between two? If indeed his Majesty would consent
 to go over to the Assembly! His Majesty, above all her Majesty,
 cannot agree to that. Did her Majesty answer the proposal with a
 ‘_Fi donc;_’ did she say even, she would be nailed to the walls
 sooner? Apparently not. It is written also that she offered the
 King a pistol; saying, Now or else never was the time to shew
 himself. Close eye-witnesses did not see it, nor do we. That saw
 only that she was queenlike, quiet; that she argued not,
 upbraided not, with the Inexorable; but, like Cæsar in the
 Capitol, wrapped her mantle, as it beseems Queens and Sons of
 Adam to do. But thou, O Louis! of what stuff art thou at all? Is
 there no stroke in thee, then, for Life and Crown? The silliest
 hunted deer dies not so. Art thou the languidest of all mortals;
 or the mildest-minded? Thou art the worst-starred. The tide advances; Syndic Rœderer’s and all men’s straits grow
 straiter and straiter. Fremescent clangor comes from the armed
 Nationals in the Court; far and wide is the infinite hubbub of
 tongues. What counsel? And the tide is now nigh! Messengers,
 forerunners speak hastily through the outer Grates; hold parley
 sitting astride the walls. Syndic Rœderer goes out and comes in.
 Cannoneers ask him: Are we to fire against the people? King’s
 Ministers ask him: Shall the King’s House be forced? Syndic
 Rœderer has a hard game to play. He speaks to the Cannoneers with
 eloquence, with fervour; such fervour as a man can, who has to
 blow hot and cold in one breath. Hot and cold, O Rœderer? We, for
 our part, cannot live _and_ die! The Cannoneers, by way of
 answer, fling down their linstocks.—Think of this answer, O King
 Louis, and King’s Ministers: and take a poor Syndic’s safe
 middle-course, towards the Salle de Manége. King Louis sits, his
 hands leant on knees, body bent forward; gazes for a space
 fixedly on Syndic Rœderer; then answers, looking over his
 shoulder to the Queen: _Marchons!_ They march; King Louis, Queen,
 Sister Elizabeth, the two royal children and governess: these,
 with Syndic Rœderer, and Officials of the Department; amid a
 double rank of National Guards. The men with blunderbusses, the
 steady red Swiss gaze mournfully, reproachfully; but hear only
 these words from Syndic Rœderer: ‘The King is going to the
 Assembly; make way.’ It has struck eight, on all clocks, some
 minutes ago: the King has left the Tuileries—for ever. O ye stanch Swiss, ye gallant gentlemen in black, for what a
 cause are ye to spend and be spent! Look out from the western
 windows, ye may see King Louis placidly hold on his way; the poor
 little Prince Royal “sportfully kicking the fallen leaves.”
 Fremescent multitude on the Terrace of the Feuillants whirls
 parallel to him; one man in it, very noisy, with a long pole:
 will they not obstruct the outer Staircase, and back-entrance of
 the Salle, when it comes to that? King’s Guards can go no further
 than the bottom step there. Lo, Deputation of Legislators come
 out; he of the long pole is stilled by oratory; Assembly’s Guards
 join themselves to King’s Guards, and all may mount in this case
 of necessity; the outer Staircase is free, or passable. See,
 Royalty ascends; a blue Grenadier lifts the poor little Prince
 Royal from the press; Royalty has entered in. Royalty has
 vanished for ever from your eyes.—And ye? Left standing there,
 amid the yawning abysses, and earthquake of Insurrection; without
 course; without command: if ye perish it must be as more than
 martyrs, as martyrs who are now without a cause! The black
 Courtiers disappear mostly; through such issues as they can. The
 poor Swiss know not how to act: one duty only is clear to them,
 that of standing by their post; and they will perform that. But the glittering steel tide has arrived; it beats now against
 the Château barriers, and eastern Courts; irresistible,
 loud-surging far and wide;—breaks in, fills the Court of the
 Carrousel, blackbrowed Marseillese in the van. King Louis gone,
 say you; over to the Assembly! Well and good: but till the
 Assembly pronounce Forfeiture of him, what boots it? Our post is
 in that Château or stronghold of his; there till then must we
 continue. Think, ye stanch Swiss, whether it were good that grim
 murder began, and brothers blasted one another in pieces for a
 stone edifice?—Poor Swiss! they know not how to act: from the
 southern windows, some fling cartridges, in sign of brotherhood;
 on the eastern outer staircase, and within through long stairs
 and corridors, they stand firm-ranked, peaceable and yet refusing
 to stir. Westermann speaks to them in Alsatian German;
 Marseillese plead, in hot Provençal speech and pantomime;
 stunning hubbub pleads and threatens, infinite, around. The Swiss
 stand fast, peaceable and yet immovable; red granite pier in that
 waste-flashing sea of steel. Who can help the inevitable issue; Marseillese and all France, on
 this side; granite Swiss on that? The pantomime grows hotter and
 hotter; Marseillese sabres flourishing by way of action; the
 Swiss brow also clouding itself, the Swiss thumb bringing its
 firelock to the cock. And hark! high-thundering above all the
 din, three Marseillese cannon from the Carrousel, pointed by a
 gunner of bad aim, come rattling over the roofs! Ye Swiss,
 therefore: _Fire!_ The Swiss fire; by volley, by platoon, in
 rolling-fire: Marseillese men not a few, and “a tall man that was
 louder than any,” lie silent, smashed, upon the pavement;—not a
 few Marseillese, after the long dusty march, have made halt
 _here_. The Carrousel is void; the black tide recoiling;
 “fugitives rushing as far as Saint-Antoine before they stop.” The
 Cannoneers without linstock have squatted invisible, and left
 their cannon; which the Swiss seize. Think what a volley: reverberating doomful to the four corners of
 Paris, and through all hearts; like the clang of Bellona’s
 thongs! The blackbrowed Marseillese, rallying on the instant,
 have become black Demons that know how to die. Nor is Brest
 behind-hand; nor Alsatian Westermann; Demoiselle Théroigne is
 Sybil Théroigne: Vengeance _Victoire, ou la mort!_ From all
 Patriot artillery, great and small; from Feuillants Terrace, and
 all terraces and places of the widespread Insurrectionary sea,
 there roars responsive a red whirlwind. Blue Nationals, ranked in
 the Garden, cannot help their muskets going off, _against_
 Foreign murderers. For there is a sympathy in muskets, in heaped
 masses of men: nay, are not Mankind, in whole, like tuned
 strings, and a cunning infinite concordance and unity; you smite
 one string, and all strings will begin sounding,—in soft
 sphere-melody, in deafening screech of madness! Mounted
 Gendarmerie gallop distracted; are fired on merely as a thing
 running; galloping over the Pont Royal, or one knows not whither.
 The brain of Paris, brain-fevered in the centre of it here, has
 gone mad; what you call, taken fire. Behold, the fire slackens not; nor does the Swiss rolling-fire
 slacken from within. Nay they clutched cannon, as we saw: and
 now, from the other side, they clutch three pieces more; alas,
 cannon without linstock; nor will the steel-and-flint answer,
 though they try it.[505] Had it chanced to answer! Patriot
 onlookers have their misgivings; one strangest Patriot onlooker
 thinks that the Swiss, had they a commander, would beat. He is a
 man not unqualified to judge; the name of him is Napoleon
 Buonaparte.[506] And onlookers, and women, stand gazing, and the
 witty Dr. Moore of Glasgow among them, on the other side of the
 River: cannon rush rumbling past them; pause on the Pont Royal;
 belch out their iron entrails there, against the Tuileries; and
 at every new belch, the women and onlookers shout and clap
 hands.[507] City of all the Devils! In remote streets, men are
 drinking breakfast-coffee; following their affairs; with a start
 now and then, as some dull echo reverberates a note louder. And
 here? Marseillese fall wounded; but Barbaroux has surgeons;
 Barbaroux is close by, managing, though underhand, and under
 cover. Marseillese fall death-struck; bequeath their firelock,
 specify in which pocket are the cartridges; and die, murmuring,
 ‘Revenge me, Revenge thy country!’ Brest Fédéré Officers,
 galloping in red coats, are shot as Swiss. Lo you, the Carrousel
 has burst into flame!—Paris Pandemonium! Nay the poor City, as we
 said, is in fever-fit and convulsion; such crisis has lasted for
 the space of some half hour. But what is this that, with Legislative Insignia, ventures
 through the hubbub and death-hail, from the back-entrance of the
 Manege? Towards the Tuileries and Swiss: written Order from his
 Majesty to cease firing! O ye hapless Swiss, why was there no
 order not to begin it? Gladly would the Swiss cease firing: but
 who will bid mad Insurrection cease firing? To Insurrection you
 cannot speak; neither can it, hydra-headed, hear. The dead and
 dying, by the hundred, lie all around; are borne bleeding through
 the streets, towards help; the sight of them, like a torch of the
 Furies, kindling Madness. Patriot Paris roars; as the bear
 bereaved of her whelps. On, ye Patriots: vengeance! victory or
 death! There are men seen, who rush on, armed only with
 walking-sticks.[508] Terror and Fury rule the hour. The Swiss, pressed on from without, paralyzed from within, have
 ceased to shoot; but not to be shot. What shall they do?
 Desperate is the moment. Shelter or instant death: yet How?
 Where? One party flies out by the Rue de l’Echelle; is destroyed
 utterly, “_en entier_.” A second, by the other side, throws
 itself into the Garden; “hurrying across a keen fusillade:”
 rushes suppliant into the National Assembly; finds pity and
 refuge in the back benches there. The third, and largest, darts
 out in column, three hundred strong, towards the Champs Elysées:
 Ah, could we but reach Courbevoye, where other Swiss are! Wo!
 see, in such fusillade the column “soon breaks itself by
 diversity of opinion,” into distracted segments, this way and
 that;—to escape in holes, to die fighting from street to street.
 The firing and murdering will not cease; not yet for long. The
 red Porters of Hotels are shot at, be they _Suisse_ by nature, or
 _Suisse_ only in name. The very Firemen, who pump and labour on
 that smoking Carrousel, are shot at; why should the Carrousel
 _not_ burn? Some Swiss take refuge in private houses; find that
 mercy too does still dwell in the heart of man. The brave
 Marseillese are merciful, late so wroth; and labour to save.
 Journalist Gorsas pleads hard with enfuriated groups. Clemence,
 the Wine-merchant, stumbles forward to the Bar of the Assembly, a
 rescued Swiss in his hand; tells passionately how he rescued him
 with pain and peril, how he will henceforth support him, being
 childless himself; and falls a swoon round the poor Swiss’s neck:
 amid plaudits. But the most are butchered, and even mangled.
 Fifty (some say Fourscore) were marched as prisoners, by National
 Guards, to the Hôtel-de-Ville: the ferocious people bursts
 through on them, in the Place de Grève; massacres them to the
 last man. “_O Peuple_, envy of the universe!” _Peuple_, in mad
 Gaelic effervescence! Surely few things in the history of carnage are painfuller. What
 ineffaceable red streak, flickering so sad in the memory, is
 that, of this poor column of red Swiss “breaking itself in the
 confusion of opinions;” dispersing, into blackness and death!
 Honour to you, brave men; honourable pity, through long times!
 Not martyrs were ye; and yet almost more. He was no King of
 yours, this Louis; and he forsook you like a King of shreds and
 patches; ye were but sold to him for some poor sixpence a-day;
 yet would ye work for your wages, keep your plighted word. The
 work now was to die; and ye did it. Honour to you, O Kinsmen; and
 may the old Deutsch _Biederkeit_ and _Tapferkeit_, and Valour
 which is _Worth_ and _Truth_ be they Swiss, be they Saxon, fail
 in no age! Not bastards; true-born were these men; sons of the
 men of Sempach, of Murten, who knelt, but not to thee, O
 Burgundy!—Let the traveller, as he passes through Lucerne, turn
 aside to look a little at their monumental Lion; not for
 Thorwaldsen’s sake alone. Hewn out of living rock, the Figure
 rests there, by the still Lake-waters, in lullaby of
 distant-tinkling _rance-des-vaches_, the granite Mountains dumbly
 keeping watch all round; and, though inanimate, speaks.
 Chapter 2.6.VIII.
 Constitution burst in Pieces. Thus is the Tenth of August won and lost. Patriotism reckons its
 slain by thousand on thousand, so deadly was the Swiss fire from
 these windows; but will finally reduce them to some Twelve
 hundred. No child’s play was it;—nor is it! Till two in the
 afternoon the massacring, the breaking and the burning has not
 ended; nor the loose Bedlam shut itself again. How deluges of frantic Sansculottism roared through all passages
 of this Tuileries, ruthless in vengeance, how the Valets were
 butchered, hewn down; and Dame Campan saw the Marseilles sabre
 flash over her head, but the Blackbrowed said, ‘_Va-t-en_, Get
 thee gone,’ and flung her from him unstruck:[509] how in the
 cellars wine-bottles were broken, wine-butts were staved in and
 drunk; and, upwards to the very garrets, all windows tumbled out
 their precious royal furnitures; and, with gold mirrors, velvet
 curtains, down of ript feather-beds, and dead bodies of men, the
 Tuileries was like no Garden of the Earth:—all this let him who
 has a taste for it see amply in Mercier, in acrid Montgaillard,
 or Beaulieu of the _Deux Amis_. A hundred and eighty bodies of
 Swiss lie piled there; naked, unremoved till the second day.
 Patriotism has torn their red coats into snips; and marches with
 them at the Pike’s point: the ghastly bare corpses lie there,
 under the sun and under the stars; the curious of both sexes
 crowding to look. Which let not us do. Above a hundred carts
 heaped with Dead fare towards the Cemetery of Sainte-Madeleine;
 bewailed, bewept; for all had kindred, all had mothers, if not
 here, then there. It is one of those Carnage-fields, such as you
 read of by the name “Glorious Victory,” brought home in this case
 to one’s own door. But the blackbrowed Marseillese have struck down the Tyrant of
 the Château. He is struck down; low, and hardly to rise. What a
 moment for an august Legislative was that when the Hereditary
 Representative entered, under such circumstances; and the
 Grenadier, carrying the little Prince Royal out of the Press, set
 him down on the Assembly-table! A moment,—which one had to smooth
 off with oratory; waiting what the next would bring! Louis said
 few words: ‘He was come hither to prevent a great crime; he
 believed himself safer nowhere than here.’ President Vergniaud
 answered briefly, in vague oratory as we say, about ‘defence of
 Constituted Authorities,’ about dying at our post.[510] And so
 King Louis sat him down; first here, then there; for a difficulty
 arose, the Constitution not permitting us to debate while the
 King is present: finally he settles himself with his Family in
 the “_Loge_ of the _Logographe_” in the Reporter’s-Box of a
 Journalist: which is beyond the enchanted Constitutional Circuit,
 separated from it by a rail. To such Lodge of the _Logographe_,
 measuring some ten feet square, with a small closet at the
 entrance of it behind, is the King of broad France now limited:
 here can he and his sit pent, under the eyes of the world, or
 retire into their closet at intervals; for the space of sixteen
 hours. Such quiet peculiar moment has the Legislative lived to
 see. But also what a moment was that other, few minutes later, when
 the three Marseillese cannon went off, and the Swiss rolling-fire
 and universal thunder, like the Crack of Doom, began to rattle!
 Honourable Members start to their feet; stray bullets singing
 epicedium even here, shivering in with window-glass and jingle.
 ‘No, this is our post; let us die here!’ They sit therefore, like
 stone Legislators. But may not the Lodge of the _Logographe_ be
 forced from behind? Tear down the railing that divides it from
 the enchanted Constitutional Circuit! Ushers tear and tug; his
 Majesty himself aiding from within: the railing gives way;
 Majesty and Legislative are united in place, unknown Destiny
 hovering over both. Rattle, and again rattle, went the thunder; one breathless
 wide-eyed messenger rushing in after another: King’s orders to
 the Swiss went out. It was a fearful thunder; but, as we know, it
 ended. Breathless messengers, fugitive Swiss, denunciatory
 Patriots, trepidation; finally tripudiation!—Before four o’clock
 much has come and gone. The New Municipals have come and gone; with Three Flags,
 _Liberté, Egalité, Patrie_, and the clang of vivats. Vergniaud,
 he who as President few hours ago talked of Dying for Constituted
 Authorities, has moved, as Committee-Reporter, that the
 Hereditary Representative _be suspended;_ that a NATIONAL
 CONVENTION do forthwith assemble to say what further! An able
 Report: which the President must have had ready in his pocket? A
 President, in such cases, must have much ready, and yet not
 ready; and Janus-like look before and after. King Louis listens to all; retires about midnight “to three
 little rooms on the upper floor;” till the Luxembourg be prepared
 for him, and “the safeguard of the Nation.” Safer if Brunswick
 were once here! Or, alas, not so safe? Ye hapless discrowned
 heads! Crowds came, next morning, to catch a climpse of them, in
 their three upper rooms. Montgaillard says the august Captives
 wore an air of cheerfulness, even of gaiety; that the Queen and
 Princess Lamballe, who had joined her over night, looked out of
 the open window, “shook powder from their hair on the people
 below, and laughed.”[511] He is an acrid distorted man. For the rest, one may guess that the Legislative, above all that
 the New Municipality continues busy. Messengers, Municipal or
 Legislative, and swift despatches rush off to all corners of
 France; full of triumph, blended with indignant wail, for Twelve
 hundred have fallen. France sends up its blended shout
 responsive; the Tenth of August shall be as the Fourteenth of
 July, only bloodier and greater. The Court has conspired? Poor
 Court: the Court has been vanquished; and will have both the
 scath to bear and the scorn. How the Statues of Kings do now all
 fall! Bronze Henri himself, though he wore a cockade once,
 jingles down from the Pont Neuf, where _Patrie_ floats _in
 Danger_. Much more does Louis Fourteenth, from the Place Vendôme,
 jingle down, and even breaks in falling. The curious can remark,
 written on his horse’s shoe: “12 _Août_ 1692;” a Century and a
 Day. The Tenth of August was Friday. The week is not done, when our
 old Patriot Ministry is recalled, what of it can be got: strict
 Roland, Genevese Clavière; add heavy Monge the Mathematician,
 once a stone-hewer; and, for Minister of Justice,—Danton “led
 hither,” as himself says, in one of his gigantic figures,
 “through the breach of Patriot cannon!” These, under Legislative
 Committees, must rule the wreck as they can: confusedly enough;
 with an old Legislative waterlogged, with a New Municipality so
 brisk. But National Convention will get itself together; and
 _then!_ Without delay, however, let a New Jury-Court and Criminal
 Tribunal be set up in Paris, to try the crimes and conspiracies
 of the Tenth. High Court of Orléans is distant, slow: the blood
 of the Twelve hundred Patriots, whatever become of other blood,
 shall be inquired after. Tremble, ye Criminals and Conspirators;
 the Minister of Justice is Danton! Robespierre too, after the
 victory, sits in the New Municipality; insurrectionary
 “improvised Municipality,” which calls itself Council General of
 the Commune. For three days now, Louis and his Family have heard the
 Legislative Debates in the Lodge of the _Logographe;_ and retired
 nightly to their small upper rooms. The Luxembourg and safeguard
 of the Nation could not be got ready: nay, it seems the
 Luxembourg has too many cellars and issues; no Municipality can
 undertake to watch it. The compact Prison of the Temple, not so
 elegant indeed, were much safer. To the Temple, therefore! On
 Monday, 13th day of August 1792, in Mayor Pétion’s carriage,
 Louis and his sad suspended Household, fare thither; all Paris
 out to look at them. As they pass through the Place Vendôme Louis
 Fourteenth’s Statue lies broken on the ground. Pétion is afraid
 the Queen’s looks may be thought scornful, and produce
 provocation; she casts down her eyes, and does not look at all.
 The “press is prodigious,” but quiet: here and there, it shouts
 _Vive la Nation;_ but for most part gazes in silence. French
 Royalty vanishes within the gates of the Temple: these old peaked
 Towers, like peaked Extinguisher or _Bonsoir_, do cover it
 up;—from which same Towers, poor Jacques Molay and his Templars
 were burnt out, by French Royalty, five centuries since. Such are
 the turns of Fate below. Foreign Ambassadors, English Lord Gower
 have all demanded passports; are driving indignantly towards
 their respective homes. So, then, the Constitution is over? For ever and a day! Gone is
 that wonder of the Universe; First biennial Parliament,
 waterlogged, waits only till the Convention come; and will then
 sink to endless depths. One can guess the silent rage of Old-Constituents,
 Constitution-builders, extinct Feuillants, men who thought the
 Constitution would march! Lafayette rises to the altitude of the
 situation; at the head of his Army. Legislative Commissioners are
 posting towards him and it, on the Northern Frontier, to
 congratulate and perorate: he orders the Municipality of Sedan to
 arrest these Commissioners, and keep them strictly in ward as
 Rebels, till he say further. The Sedan Municipals obey. The Sedan Municipals obey: but the Soldiers of the Lafayette
 Army? The Soldiers of the Lafayette Army have, as all Soldiers
 have, a kind of dim feeling that they themselves are Sansculottes
 in buff belts; that the victory of the Tenth of August is also a
 victory for them. They will not rise and follow Lafayette to
 Paris; they will rise and _send_ him thither! On the 18th, which
 is but next Saturday, Lafayette, with some two or three indignant
 Staff-officers, one of whom is Old-Constituent Alexandre de
 Lameth, having first put his Lines in what order he could,—rides
 swiftly over the Marches, towards Holland. Rides, alas, swiftly
 into the claws of Austrians! He, long-wavering, trembling on the
 verge of the horizon, has set, in Olmutz Dungeons; this History
 knows him no more. Adieu, thou Hero of two worlds; thinnest, but
 compact honour-worthy man! Through long rough night of captivity,
 through other tumults, triumphs and changes, thou wilt swing
 well, “fast-anchored to the Washington Formula;” and be the Hero
 and Perfect-character, were it only of one idea. The Sedan
 Municipals repent and protest; the Soldiers shout _Vive la
 Nation_. Dumouriez Polymetis, from his Camp at Maulde, sees
 himself made Commander in Chief. And, O Brunswick! what sort of “military execution” will Paris
 merit now? Forward, ye well-drilled exterminatory men; with your
 artillery-waggons, and camp kettles jingling. Forward, tall
 chivalrous King of Prussia; fanfaronading Emigrants and war-god
 Broglie, “for some consolation to mankind,” which verily is not
 without need of some. END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.

 BOOK 3.I.
 SEPTEMBER
 Chapter 3.1.I.
 The Improvised Commune. Ye have roused her, then, ye Emigrants and Despots of the world;
 France is roused; long have ye been lecturing and tutoring this
 poor Nation, like cruel uncalled-for pedagogues, shaking over her
 your ferulas of fire and steel: it is long that ye have pricked
 and fillipped and affrighted her, there as she sat helpless in
 her dead cerements of a Constitution, you gathering in on her
 from all lands, with your armaments and plots, your invadings and
 truculent bullyings;—and lo now, ye have pricked her to the
 quick, and she is up, and her blood is up. The dead cerements are
 rent into cobwebs, and she fronts you in that terrible strength
 of Nature, which no man has measured, which goes down to Madness
 and Tophet: see now how ye will deal with her! This month of September, 1792, which has become one of the
 memorable months of History, presents itself under two most
 diverse aspects; all of black on the one side, all of bright on
 the other. Whatsoever is cruel in the panic frenzy of Twenty-five
 million men, whatsoever is great in the simultaneous
 death-defiance of Twenty-five million men, stand here in abrupt
 contrast, near by one another. As indeed is usual when a man, how
 much more when a Nation of men, is hurled suddenly beyond the
 limits. For Nature, as green as she looks, rests everywhere on
 dread foundations, were we farther down; and Pan, to whose music
 the Nymphs dance, has a cry in him that can drive all men
 distracted.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Very frightful it is when a Nation, rending asunder its
 Constitutions and Regulations which were grown dead cerements for
 it, becomes _trans_cendental; and must now seek its wild way
 through the New, Chaotic,—where Force is not yet distinguished
 into Bidden and Forbidden, but Crime and Virtue welter
 unseparated,—in that domain of what is called the Passions; of
 what we call the Miracles and the Portents! It is thus that, for
 some three years to come, we are to contemplate France, in this
 final Third Volume of our History. Sansculottism reigning in all
 its grandeur and in all its hideousness: the Gospel (God’s
 Message) of Man’s Rights, Man’s _mights_ or strengths, once more
 preached irrefragably abroad; along with this, and still louder
 for the time, and fearfullest Devil’s-Message of Man’s weaknesses
 and sins;—and all on such a scale, and under such aspect: cloudy
 “death-birth of a world;” huge smoke-cloud, streaked with rays as
 of heaven on one side; girt on the other as with hell-fire!
 History tells us many things: but for the last thousand years and
 more, what thing has she told us of a sort like this? Which
 therefore let us two, O Reader, dwell on willingly, for a little;
 and from its endless significance endeavour to extract what may,
 in present circumstances, be adapted for us. It is unfortunate, though very natural, that the history of this
 Period has so generally been written in hysterics. Exaggeration
 abounds, execration, wailing; and, on the whole, darkness. But
 thus too, when foul old Rome had to be swept from the Earth, and
 those Northmen, and other horrid sons of Nature, came in,
 “swallowing formulas” as the French now do, foul old Rome
 screamed execratively her loudest; so that, the true shape of
 many things is lost for us. Attila’s Huns had arms of such length
 that they could lift a stone without stooping. Into the body of
 the poor Tatars execrative Roman History intercalated an
 alphabetic letter; and so they continue Ta-r-tars, of fell
 Tartarean nature, to this day. Here, in like manner, search as we
 will in these multi-form innumerable French Records, darkness too
 frequently covers, or sheer distraction bewilders. One finds it
 difficult to imagine that the Sun shone in this September month,
 as he does in others. Nevertheless it is an indisputable fact
 that the Sun did shine; and there was weather and work,—nay, as
 to that, very bad weather for harvest work! An unlucky Editor may
 do his utmost; and after all, require allowances. He had been a wise Frenchman, who, looking, close at hand, on
 this waste aspect of a France all stirring and whirling, in ways
 new, untried, had been able to discern where the cardinal
 movement lay; which tendency it was that had the rule and primary
 direction of it then! But at forty-four years’ distance, it is
 different. To all men now, two cardinal movements or grand
 tendencies, in the September whirl, have become discernible
 enough: that stormful effluence towards the Frontiers; that
 frantic crowding towards Townhouses and Council-halls in the
 interior. Wild France dashes, in desperate death-defiance,
 towards the Frontiers, to defend itself from foreign Despots;
 crowds towards Townhalls and Election Committee-rooms, to defend
 itself from domestic Aristocrats. Let the Reader conceive well
 these two cardinal movements; and what side-currents and endless
 vortexes might depend on these. He shall judge too, whether, in
 such sudden wreckage of all old Authorities, such a pair of
 cardinal movements, half-frantic in themselves, could be of soft
 nature? As in dry Sahara, when the winds waken, and lift and
 winnow the immensity of sand! The air itself (Travellers say) is
 a dim sand-air; and dim looming through it, the wonderfullest
 uncertain colonnades of Sand-Pillars rush whirling from this side
 and from that, like so many mad Spinning-Dervishes, of a hundred
 feet in stature; and dance their huge Desert-waltz there!— Nevertheless in all human movements, were they but a day old,
 there is order, or the beginning of order. Consider two things in
 this Sahara-waltz of the French Twenty-five millions; or rather
 one thing, and one hope of a thing: the _Commune_ (Municipality)
 of Paris, which is already here; the National Convention, which
 shall in few weeks be here. The Insurrectionary Commune, which
 improvising itself on the eve of the Tenth of August, worked this
 ever-memorable Deliverance by explosion, must needs rule over
 it,—till the Convention meet. This Commune, which they may well
 call a spontaneous or “improvised” Commune, is, for the present,
 sovereign of France. The Legislative, deriving its authority from
 the Old, how can _it_ now have authority when the Old is exploded
 by insurrection? As a floating piece of wreck, certain things,
 persons and interests may still cleave to it: volunteer
 defenders, riflemen or pikemen in green uniform, or red nightcap
 (of _bonnet rouge_), defile before it daily, just on the wing
 towards Brunswick; with the brandishing of arms; always with some
 touch of Leonidas-eloquence, often with a fire of daring that
 threatens to outherod Herod,—the Galleries, “especially the
 Ladies, never done with applauding.”[512] Addresses of this or
 the like sort can be received and answered, in the hearing of all
 France: the Salle de Manége is still useful as a place of
 proclamation. For which use, indeed, it now chiefly serves.
 Vergniaud delivers spirit-stirring orations; but always with a
 prophetic sense only, looking towards the coming Convention. ‘Let
 our memory perish,’ cries Vergniaud, ‘but let France be
 free!’—whereupon they all start to their feet, shouting
 responsive: ‘Yes, yes, _périsse notre mémoire, pourvu que la
 France soit libre!_’[513] Disfrocked Chabot abjures Heaven that
 at least we may ‘have done with Kings;’ and fast as powder under
 spark, we all blaze up once more, and with waved hats shout and
 swear: ‘Yes, _nous le jurons; plus de roi!_’[514] All which, as a
 method of proclamation, is very convenient. For the rest, that our busy Brissots, rigorous Rolands, men who
 once had authority and now have less and less; men who love law,
 and will have even an Explosion explode itself, as far as
 possible, according to rule, do find this state of matters most
 unofficial unsatisfactory,—is not to be denied. Complaints are
 made; attempts are made: but without effect. The attempts even
 recoil; and must be desisted from, for fear of worse: the sceptre
 is departed from this Legislative once and always. A poor
 Legislative, so hard was fate, had let itself be hand-gyved,
 nailed to the rock like an Andromeda, and could only wail there
 to the Earth and Heavens; miraculously a winged Perseus (or
 Improvised Commune) has dawned out of the void Blue, and cut her
 loose: but whether now is it she, with her softness and musical
 speech, or is it he, with his hardness and sharp falchion and
 aegis, that shall have casting vote? Melodious _agreement_ of
 vote; this were the rule! But if otherwise, and votes diverge,
 then surely Andromeda’s part is to weep,—if possible, tears of
 gratitude alone. Be content, O France, with this Improvised Commune, such as it
 is! It has the implements, and has the hands: the time is not
 long. On Sunday the twenty-sixth of August, our Primary
 Assemblies shall meet, begin electing of Electors; on Sunday the
 second of September (may the day prove lucky!) the Electors shall
 begin electing Deputies; and so an all-healing National
 Convention will come together. No _marc d’argent_, or distinction
 of Active and Passive, now insults the French Patriot: but there
 is universal suffrage, unlimited liberty to choose.
 Old-constituents, Present-Legislators, all France is eligible.
 Nay, it may be said, the flower of all the Universe (_de
 l’Univers_) is eligible; for in these very days we, by act of
 Assembly, “naturalise” the chief Foreign Friends of humanity:
 Priestley, burnt out for us in Birmingham; Klopstock, a genius of
 all countries; Jeremy Bentham, useful Jurisconsult; distinguished
 Paine, the rebellious Needleman;—some of whom may be chosen. As
 is most fit; for a Convention of this kind. In a word, Seven
 Hundred and Forty-five unshackled sovereigns, admired of the
 universe, shall replace this hapless impotency of a
 Legislative,—out of which, it is likely, the best members, and
 the Mountain in mass, may be re-elected. Roland is getting ready
 the _Salles des Cent Suisses_, as preliminary rendezvous for
 them; in that void Palace of the Tuileries, now void and
 National, and not a Palace, but a Caravansera. As for the Spontaneous Commune, one may say that there never was
 on Earth a stranger Town-Council. Administration, not of a great
 City, but of a great Kingdom in a state of revolt and frenzy,
 this is the task that has fallen to it. Enrolling, provisioning,
 judging; devising, deciding, doing, endeavouring to do: one
 wonders the human brain did not give way under all this, and
 reel. But happily human brains have such a talent of taking up
 simply what they can carry, and ignoring all the rest; leaving
 all the rest, as if it were not there! Whereby somewhat is verily
 shifted for; and much shifts for itself. This Improvised Commune
 walks along, nothing doubting; promptly making front, without
 fear or flurry, at what moment soever, to the wants of the
 moment. Were the world on fire, one improvised tricolor Municipal
 has but one life to lose. They are the elixir and chosen-men of
 Sansculottic Patriotism; promoted to the forlorn-hope;
 unspeakable victory or a high gallows, this is their meed. They
 sit there, in the Townhall, these astonishing tricolor
 Municipals; in Council General; in Committee of Watchfulness (_de
 Surveillance_, which will even become _de Salut Public_, of
 Public Salvation), or what other Committees and Sub-committees
 are needful;—managing infinite Correspondence; passing infinite
 Decrees: one hears of a Decree being “the ninety-eighth of the
 day.” Ready! is the word. They carry loaded pistols in their
 pocket; also some improvised luncheon by way of meal. Or indeed,
 by and by, _traiteurs_ contract for the supply of repasts, to be
 eaten on the spot,—too lavishly, as it was afterwards grumbled.
 Thus they: girt in their tricolor sashes; Municipal note-paper in
 the one hand, fire-arms in other. They have their Agents out all
 over France; speaking in townhouses, market-places, highways and
 byways; agitating, urging to arm; all hearts tingling to hear.
 Great is the fire of Anti-Aristocrat eloquence: nay some, as
 Bibliopolic Momoro, seem to hint afar off at something which
 smells of Agrarian Law, and a surgery of the overswoln dropsical
 strong-box itself;—whereat indeed the bold Bookseller runs risk
 of being hanged, and Ex-Constituent Buzot has to smuggle him
 off.[515] Governing Persons, were they never so insignificant
 intrinsically, have for most part plenty of Memoir-writers; and
 the curious, in after-times, can learn minutely their goings out
 and comings in: which, as men always love to know their
 fellow-men in singular situations, is a comfort, of its kind. Not
 so, with these Governing Persons, now in the Townhall! And yet
 what most original fellow-man, of the Governing sort,
 high-chancellor, king, kaiser, secretary of the home or the
 foreign department, ever shewed such a phasis as Clerk Tallien,
 Procureur Manuel, future Procureur Chaumette, here in this
 Sand-waltz of the Twenty-five millions, now do? O brother
 mortals,—thou Advocate Panis, friend of Danton, kinsman of
 Santerre; Engraver Sergent, since called _Agate_ Sergent; thou
 Huguenin, with the tocsin in thy heart! But, as Horace says, they
 wanted the sacred memoir-writer (_sacro vate_); and we know them
 not. Men bragged of August and its doings, publishing them in
 high places; but of this September none now or afterwards would
 brag. The September world remains dark, fuliginous, as Lapland
 witch-midnight;—from which, indeed, very strange shapes will
 evolve themselves. Understand this, however: that incorruptible Robespierre is not
 wanting, now when the brunt of battle is past; in a stealthy way
 the seagreen man sits there, his feline eyes excellent in the
 twilight. Also understand this other, a single fact worth many:
 that Marat is not only there, but has a seat of honour assigned
 him, a _tribune particulière_. How changed for Marat; lifted from
 his dark cellar into this luminous “peculiar tribune!” All dogs
 have their day; even rabid dogs. Sorrowful, incurable Philoctetes
 Marat; without whom Troy cannot be taken! Hither, as a main
 element of the Governing Power, has Marat been raised. Royalist
 types, for we have “suppressed” innumerable Durosoys, Royous, and
 even clapt them in prison,—Royalist types replace the worn types
 often snatched from a People’s-Friend in old ill days. In our
 “peculiar tribune” we write and redact: Placards, of due monitory
 terror; _Amis-du-Peuple_ (now under the name of _Journal de la
 République_); and sit obeyed of men. “Marat,” says one, “is the
 conscience of the Hôtel-de-Ville.” _Keeper_, as some call it, of
 the Sovereign’s Conscience;—which surely, in such hands, will not
 lie hid in a napkin! Two great movements, as we said, agitate this distracted National
 mind: a rushing against domestic Traitors, a rushing against
 foreign Despots. Mad movements both, restrainable by no known
 rule; strongest passions of human nature driving them on: love,
 hatred; vengeful sorrow, braggart Nationality also vengeful,—and
 pale Panic over all! Twelve Hundred slain Patriots, do they not,
 from their dark catacombs there, in Death’s dumb-shew, plead (O
 ye Legislators) for vengeance? Such was the destructive rage of
 these Aristocrats on the ever-memorable Tenth. Nay, apart from
 vengeance, and with an eye to Public Salvation only, are there
 not still, in this Paris (in round numbers) “thirty thousand
 Aristocrats,” of the most malignant humour; driven now to their
 last trump-card?—Be patient, ye Patriots: our New High Court,
 “Tribunal of the Seventeenth,” sits; each Section has sent Four
 Jurymen; and Danton, extinguishing improper judges, improper
 practices wheresoever found, is “the same man you have known at
 the Cordeliers.” With such a Minister of Justice shall not
 Justice be done?—Let it be swift then, answers universal
 Patriotism; swift and sure!— One would hope, this Tribunal of the Seventeenth is swifter than
 most. Already on the 21st, while our Court is but four days old,
 Collenot d’Angremont, “the Royal enlister” (crimp, _embaucheur_)
 dies by torch-light. For, lo, the great _Guillotine_, wondrous to
 behold, now stands there; the Doctor’s _Idea_ has become Oak and
 Iron; the huge cyclopean axe “falls in its grooves like the ram
 of the Pile-engine,” swiftly snuffing out the light of men?”
 “_Mais vous, Gualches_, what have you invented?” _This?_—Poor old
 Laporte, Intendant of the Civil List, follows next; quietly, the
 mild old man. Then Durosoy, Royalist Placarder, “cashier of all
 the Anti-Revolutionists of the interior:” he went rejoicing; said
 that a Royalist like him ought to die, of all days on this day,
 the 25th or Saint Louis’s Day. All these have been tried,
 cast,—the Galleries shouting approval; and handed over to the
 Realised Idea, within a week. Besides those whom we have
 acquitted, the Galleries murmuring, and have dismissed; or even
 have personally guarded back to Prison, as the Galleries took to
 howling, and even to menacing and elbowing.[516] Languid this
 Tribunal is not. Nor does the other movement slacken; the rushing against foreign
 Despots. Strong forces shall meet in death-grip; drilled Europe
 against mad undrilled France; and singular conclusions will be
 tried.—Conceive therefore, in some faint degree, the tumult that
 whirls in this France, in this Paris! Placards from Section, from
 Commune, from Legislative, from the individual Patriot, flame
 monitory on all walls. Flags of Danger to Fatherland wave at the
 Hôtel-de-Ville; on the Pont Neuf—over the prostrate Statues of
 Kings. There is universal enlisting, urging to enlist; there is
 tearful-boastful leave-taking; irregular marching on the Great
 North-Eastern Road. Marseillese sing their wild _To Arms_, in
 chorus; which now all men, all women and children have learnt,
 and sing chorally, in Theatres, Boulevards, Streets; and the
 heart burns in every bosom: _Aux Armes! Marchons!_—Or think how
 your Aristocrats are skulking into covert; how Bertrand-Moleville
 lies hidden in some garret “in Aubry-le-boucher Street, with a
 poor surgeon who had known me;” Dame de Staël has secreted her
 Narbonne, not knowing what in the world to make of him. The
 Barriers are sometimes open, oftenest shut; no passports to be
 had; Townhall Emissaries, with the eyes and claws of falcons,
 flitting watchful on all points of your horizon! In two words:
 Tribunal of the Seventeenth, busy under howling Galleries;
 Prussian Brunswick, “over a space of forty miles,” with his
 war-tumbrils, and sleeping thunders, and Briarean “sixty-six
 thousand”[517] right-hands,—coming, coming! O Heavens, in these latter days of August, he is come! Durosoy
 was not yet guillotined when news had come that the Prussians
 were harrying and ravaging about Metz; in some four days more,
 one hears that Longwi, our first strong-place on the borders, is
 fallen “in fifteen hours.” Quick, therefore, O ye improvised
 Municipals; quick, and ever quicker!—The improvised Municipals
 make front to this also. Enrolment urges itself; and clothing,
 and arming. Our very officers have now “wool epaulettes;” for it
 is the reign of Equality, and also of Necessity. Neither do men
 now _monsieur_ and _sir_ one another; _citoyen_ (citizen) were
 suitabler; we even say _thou_, as “the free peoples of Antiquity
 did:” so have Journals and the Improvised Commune suggested;
 which shall be well. Infinitely better, meantime, could we suggest, where arms are to
 be found. For the present, our _Citoyens_ chant chorally _To
 arms;_ and have no arms! Arms are searched for; passionately;
 there is joy over any musket. Moreover, entrenchments shall be
 made round Paris: on the slopes of Montmartre men dig and shovel;
 though even the simple suspect this to be desperate. They dig;
 Tricolour sashes speak encouragement and _well-speed-ye_. Nay
 finally “twelve Members of the Legislative go daily,” not to
 encourage only, but to bear a hand, and delve: it was decreed
 with acclamation. Arms shall either be provided; or else the
 ingenuity of man crack itself, and become fatuity. Lean
 Beaumarchais, thinking to serve the Fatherland, and do a stroke
 of trade, in the old way, has commissioned sixty thousand stand
 of good arms out of Holland: would to Heaven, for Fatherland’s
 sake and his, they were come! Meanwhile railings are torn up;
 hammered into pikes: chains themselves shall be welded together,
 into pikes. The very coffins of the dead are raised; for melting
 into balls. All Church-bells must down into the furnace to make
 cannon; all Church-plate into the mint to make money. Also behold
 the fair swan-bevies of _Citoyennes_ that have alighted in
 Churches, and sit there with swan-neck,—sewing tents and
 regimentals! Nor are Patriotic Gifts wanting, from those that
 have aught left; nor stingily given: the fair Villaumes, mother
 and daughter, Milliners in the Rue St.-Martin, give “a silver
 thimble, and a coin of fifteen _sous_ (sevenpence halfpenny),”
 with other similar effects; and offer, at least the mother does,
 to mount guard. Men who have not even a thimble, give a
 thimbleful,—were it but of invention. One Citoyen has wrought out
 the scheme of a wooden cannon; which France shall exclusively
 profit by, in the first instance. It is to be made of _staves_,
 by the coopers;—of almost boundless calibre, but uncertain as to
 strength! Thus they: hammering, scheming, stitching, founding,
 with all their heart and with all their soul. Two bells only are
 to remain in each Parish,—for tocsin and other purposes. But mark also, precisely while the Prussian batteries were
 playing their briskest at Longwi in the North-East, and our
 dastardly Lavergne saw nothing for it but
 surrender,—south-westward, in remote, patriarchal La Vendée, that
 sour ferment about Nonjuring Priests, after long working, is
 ripe, and explodes: at the wrong moment for us! And so we have
 “eight thousand Peasants at Châtillon-sur-Sèvre,” who will not be
 ballotted for soldiers; will not have their Curates molested. To
 whom Bonchamps, Laroche-jaquelins, and Seigneurs enough, of a
 Royalist turn, will join themselves; with Stofflets and
 Charettes; with Heroes and Chouan Smugglers; and the loyal warmth
 of a simple people, blown into flame and fury by theological and
 seignorial bellows! So that there shall be fighting from behind
 ditches, death-volleys bursting out of thickets and ravines of
 rivers; huts burning, feet of the pitiful women hurrying to
 refuge with their children on their back; seedfields fallow,
 whitened with human bones;—“eighty thousand, of all ages, ranks,
 sexes, flying at once across the Loire,” with wail borne far on
 the winds: and, in brief, for years coming, such a suite of
 scenes as glorious war has not offered in these late ages, not
 since our Albigenses and Crusadings were over,—save indeed some
 chance Palatinate, or so, we might have to “burn,” by way of
 exception. The “eight thousand at Chatillon” will be got
 dispelled for the moment; the fire scattered, not extinguished.
 To the dints and bruises of outward battle there is to be added
 henceforth a deadlier internal gangrene. This rising in La Vendée reports itself at Paris on Wednesday the
 29th of August;—just as we had got our Electors elected; and, in
 spite of Brunswick’s and Longwi’s teeth, were hoping still to
 have a National Convention, if it pleased Heaven. But indeed,
 otherwise, this Wednesday is to be regarded as one of the
 notablest Paris had yet seen: gloomy tidings come successively,
 like Job’s messengers; are met by gloomy answers. Of Sardinia
 rising to invade the South-East, and Spain threatening the South,
 we do not speak. But are not the Prussians masters of Longwi
 (treacherously yielded, one would say); and preparing to besiege
 Verdun? Clairfait and his Austrians are encompassing Thionville;
 darkening the North. Not Metz-land now, but the Clermontais is
 getting harried; flying hulans and huzzars have been seen on the
 Chalons Road, almost as far as Sainte-Menehould. Heart, ye
 Patriots, if ye lose heart, ye lose all! It is not without a dramatic emotion that one reads in the
 Parliamentary Debates of this Wednesday evening “past seven
 o’clock,” the scene with the military fugitives from Longwi.
 Wayworn, dusty, disheartened, these poor men enter the
 Legislative, about sunset or after; give the most pathetic detail
 of the frightful pass they were in:—Prussians billowing round by
 the myriad, volcanically spouting fire for fifteen hours: we,
 scattered sparse on the ramparts, hardly a cannoneer to two guns;
 our dastard Commandant Lavergne no where shewing face; the
 priming would not catch; there was no powder in the bombs,—what
 could we do? ‘_Mourir!_ Die!’ answer prompt voices;[518] and the
 dusty fugitives must shrink elsewhither for comfort.—Yes,
 _Mourir_, that is now the word. Be Longwi a proverb and a hissing
 among French strong-places: let it (says the Legislative) be
 obliterated rather, from the shamed face of the Earth;—and so
 there has gone forth Decree, that Longwi shall, were the
 Prussians once out of it, “be rased,” and exist only as ploughed
 ground. Nor are the Jacobins milder; as how could they, the flower of
 Patriotism? Poor Dame Lavergne, wife of the poor Commandant, took
 her parasol one evening, and escorted by her Father came over to
 the Hall of the mighty Mother; and “reads a memoir tending to
 justify the Commandant of Longwi.” _Lafarge, President_, makes
 answer: ‘Citoyenne, the Nation will judge Lavergne; the Jacobins
 are bound to tell him the truth. He would have ended his course
 there (_termine sa carrière_), if he had loved the honour of his
 country.’[519]
 Chapter 3.1.II.
 Danton. But better than rasing of Longwi, or rebuking poor dusty soldiers
 or soldiers’ wives, Danton had come over, last night, and
 demanded a Decree to _search_ for arms, since they were not
 yielded voluntarily. Let “Domiciliary visits,” with rigour of
 authority, be made to this end. To search for arms; for
 horses,—Aristocratism rolls in its carriage, while Patriotism
 cannot trail its cannon. To search generally for munitions of
 war, “in the houses of persons suspect,”—and even, if it seem
 proper, to seize and imprison the suspect persons themselves! In
 the Prisons, their plots will be harmless; in the Prisons, they
 will be as hostages for us, and not without use. This Decree the
 energetic Minister of Justice demanded, last night, and got; and
 this same night it is to be executed; it is being executed, at
 the moment when these dusty soldiers get saluted with _Mourir_.
 Two thousand stand of arms, as they count, are foraged in this
 way; and some four hundred head of new Prisoners; and, on the
 whole, such a terror and damp is struck through the Aristocrat
 heart, as all but Patriotism, and even Patriotism were it out of
 this agony, might pity. Yes, Messieurs! if Brunswick blast Paris
 to ashes, he probably will blast the Prisons of Paris too: pale
 Terror, if we have got it, we will also give it, and the depth of
 horrors that lie in it; the same leaky bottom, in these wild
 waters, bears us all. One can judge what stir there was now among the “thirty thousand
 Royalists:” how the Plotters, or the accused of Plotting, shrank
 each closer into his lurking-place,—like Bertrand Moleville,
 looking eager towards Longwi, hoping the weather would keep fair.
 Or how they dressed themselves in valet’s clothes, like Narbonne,
 and “got to England as Dr. Bollman’s famulus:” how Dame de Staël
 bestirred herself, pleading with Manuel as a Sister in
 Literature, pleading even with Clerk Tallien; a pray to nameless
 chagrins![520] Royalist Peltier, the Pamphleteer, gives a
 touching Narrative (not deficient in height of colouring) of the
 terrors of that night. From five in the afternoon, a great City
 is struck suddenly silent; except for the beating of drums, for
 the tramp of marching feet; and ever and anon the dread thunder
 of the knocker at some door, a Tricolor Commissioner with his
 blue Guards (_black_-guards!) arriving. All Streets are vacant,
 says Peltier; beset by Guards at each end: all Citizens are
 ordered to be within doors. On the River float sentinal barges,
 lest we escape by water: the Barriers hermetically closed.
 Frightful! The sun shines; serenely westering, in smokeless
 mackerel-sky: Paris is as if sleeping, as if dead:—Paris is
 holding its breath, to see what stroke will fall on it. Poor
 Peltier! _Acts of Apostles_, and all jocundity of
 Leading-Articles, are gone out, and it is become bitter earnest
 instead; polished satire changed now into coarse pike-points
 (hammered out of railing); all logic reduced to this one
 primitive thesis, An eye for an eye, a tooth for a
 tooth!—Peltier, dolefully aware of it, ducks low; escapes
 unscathed to England; to urge there the inky war anew; to have
 Trial by Jury, in due season, and deliverance by young Whig
 eloquence, world-celebrated for a day. Of “thirty thousand,” naturally, great multitudes were left
 unmolested: but, as we said, some four hundred, designated as
 “persons suspect,” were seized; and an unspeakable terror fell on
 all. Wo to him who is guilty of Plotting, of Anticivism,
 Royalism, Feuillantism; who, guilty or not guilty, has an enemy
 in his Section to call him guilty! Poor old M. de Cazotte is
 seized, his young loved Daughter with him, refusing to quit him.
 Why, O Cazotte, wouldst thou quit romancing, and _Diable
 Amoureux_, for such reality as this? Poor old M. de Sombreuil, he
 of the _Invalides_, is seized: a man seen askance, by Patriotism
 ever since the Bastille days: whom also a fond Daughter will not
 quit. With young tears hardly suppressed, and old wavering
 weakness rousing itself once more—O my brothers, O my sisters! The famed and named go; the nameless, if they have an accuser.
 Necklace Lamotte’s Husband is in these Prisons (_she_ long since
 squelched on the London Pavements); but gets delivered. Gross de
 Morande, of the _Courier de l’Europe_, hobbles distractedly to
 and fro there: but they let him hobble out; on right nimble
 crutches;—his hour not being yet come. Advocate Maton de la
 Varenne, very weak in health, is snatched off from mother and
 kin; Tricolor Rossignol (journeyman goldsmith and scoundrel
 lately, a risen man now) remembers an old Pleading of Maton’s!
 Jourgniac de Saint-Méard goes; the brisk frank soldier: he was in
 the Mutiny of Nancy, in that “effervescent Regiment du Roi,”—on
 the wrong side. Saddest of all: Abbé Sicard goes; a Priest who
 could not take the Oath, but who could teach the Deaf and Dumb:
 in his Section one man, he says, had a grudge at him; one man, at
 the fit hour, launches an arrest against him; which hits. In the
 Arsenal quarter, there are dumb hearts making wail, with signs,
 with wild gestures; he their miraculous healer and speech-bringer
 is rapt away. What with the arrestments on this night of the Twenty-ninth, what
 with those that have gone on more or less, day and night, ever
 since the Tenth, one may fancy what the Prisons now were.
 Crowding and Confusion; jostle, hurry, vehemence and terror! Of
 the poor Queen’s Friends, who had followed her to the Temple and
 been committed elsewhither to Prison, some, as Governess de
 Tourzelle, are to be let go: one, the poor Princess de Lamballe,
 is not let go; but waits in the strong-rooms of La Force there,
 what will betide further.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' Among so many hundreds whom the launched arrest hits, who are
 rolled off to Townhall or Section-hall, to preliminary Houses of
 detention, and hurled in thither, as into cattle-pens, we must
 mention one other: Caron de Beaumarchais, Author of _Figaro;_
 vanquisher of Maupeou Parlements and Goezman helldogs; once
 numbered among the demigods; and now—? We left him in his
 culminant state; what dreadful decline is this, when we again
 catch a glimpse of him! “At midnight” (it was but the 12th of
 August yet), “the servant, in his shirt,” with wide-staring eyes,
 enters your room:—Monsieur, rise; all the people are come to seek
 you; they are knocking, like to break in the door! “And they were
 in fact knocking in a terrible manner (_d’une façon terrible_). I
 fling on my coat, forgetting even the waistcoat, nothing on my
 feet but slippers; and say to him”—And _he_, alas, answers mere
 negatory incoherences, panic interjections. And through the
 shutters and crevices, in front or rearward, the dull
 street-lamps disclose only streetfuls of haggard countenances;
 clamorous, bristling with pikes: and you rush distracted for an
 outlet, finding none;—and have to take refuge in the
 crockery-press, down stairs; and stand there, palpitating in that
 imperfect costume, lights dancing past your key-hole, tramp of
 feet overhead, and the tumult of Satan, “for four hours and
 more!” And old ladies, of the quarter, started up (as we hear
 next morning); rang for their _bonnes_ and cordial-drops, with
 shrill interjections: and old gentlemen, in their shirts, “leapt
 garden-walls;” flying, while none pursued; one of whom
 unfortunately broke his leg.[521] Those sixty thousand stand of
 Dutch arms (which never arrive), and the bold stroke of trade,
 have turned out so ill!— Beaumarchais escaped for this time; but not for the next time,
 ten days after. On the evening of the Twenty-ninth he is still in
 that chaos of the Prisons, in saddest, wrestling condition;
 unable to get justice, even to get audience; “Panis scratching
 his head” when you speak to him, and making off. Nevertheless let
 the lover of Figaro know that Procureur Manuel, a Brother in
 Literature, found him, and delivered him once more. But how the
 lean demigod, now shorn of his splendour, had to lurk in barns,
 to roam over harrowed fields, panting for life; and to wait under
 eavesdrops, and sit in darkness “on the Boulevard amid
 paving-stones and boulders,” longing for one word of any
 Minister, or Minister’s Clerk, about those accursed Dutch
 muskets, and getting none,—with heart fuming in spleen, and
 terror, and suppressed canine-madness: alas, how the swift sharp
 hound, once fit to be Diana’s, breaks his old teeth now, gnawing
 mere whinstones; and must “fly to England;” and, returning from
 England, must creep into the corner, and lie quiet, toothless
 (moneyless),—all this let the lover of Figaro fancy, and weep
 for. We here, without weeping, not without sadness, wave the
 withered tough fellow-mortal our farewell. His Figaro has
 returned to the French stage; nay is, at this day, sometimes
 named the best piece there. And indeed, so long as Man’s Life can
 ground itself only on artificiality and aridity; each new Revolt
 and Change of Dynasty turning up only a new stratum of
 _dry-rubbish_, and no _soil_ yet coming to view,—may it not be
 good to protest against such a Life, in many ways, and even in
 the Figaro way?
 Chapter 3.1.III.
 Dumouriez. Such are the last days of August, 1792; days gloomy, disastrous,
 and of evil omen. What will become of this poor France? Dumouriez
 rode from the Camp of Maulde, eastward to Sedan, on Tuesday last,
 the 28th of the month; reviewed that so-called Army left forlorn
 there by Lafayette: the forlorn soldiers gloomed on him; were
 heard growling on him, ‘This is one of them, _ce b—e là_, that
 made War be declared.’[522] Unpromising Army! Recruits flow in,
 filtering through Dépôt after Dépôt; but recruits merely: in want
 of all; happy if they have so much as arms. And Longwi has fallen
 basely; and Brunswick, and the Prussian King, with his sixty
 thousand, will beleaguer Verdun; and Clairfait and Austrians
 press deeper in, over the Northern marches: “a hundred and fifty
 thousand” as fear counts, “eighty thousand” as the returns shew,
 do hem us in; Cimmerian Europe behind them. There is
 Castries-and-Broglie chivalry; Royalist foot “in red facing and
 nankeen trousers;” breathing death and the gallows. And lo, finally! at Verdun on Sunday the 2d of September 1792,
 Brunswick is here. With his King and sixty thousand, glittering
 over the heights, from beyond the winding Meuse River, he looks
 down on us, on our “high citadel” and all our confectionery-ovens
 (for we are celebrated for confectionery) has sent courteous
 summons, in order to spare the effusion of blood!—Resist him to
 the death? Every day of retardation precious? How, O General
 Beaurepaire (asks the amazed Municipality) shall we resist him?
 We, the Verdun Municipals, see no resistance possible. Has he not
 sixty thousand, and artillery without end? Retardation,
 Patriotism is good; but so likewise is peaceable baking of
 pastry, and sleeping in whole skin.—Hapless Beaurepaire stretches
 out his hands, and pleads passionately, in the name of country,
 honour, of Heaven and of Earth: to no purpose. The Municipals
 have, by law, the power of ordering it;—with an Army officered by
 Royalism or Crypto-Royalism, such a Law seemed needful: and they
 order it, as pacific Pastrycooks, not as heroic Patriots
 would,—To surrender! Beaurepaire strides home, with long steps:
 his valet, entering the room, sees him “writing eagerly,” and
 withdraws. His valet hears then, in a few minutes, the report of
 a pistol: Beaurepaire is lying dead; his eager writing had been a
 brief suicidal farewell. In this manner died Beaurepaire, wept of
 France; buried in the Pantheon, with honourable pension to his
 Widow, and for Epitaph these words, _He chose Death rather than
 yield to Despots_. The Prussians, descending from the heights,
 are peaceable masters of Verdun. And so Brunswick advances, from stage to stage: who shall now
 stay him,—covering forty miles of country? Foragers fly far; the
 villages of the North-East are harried; your Hessian forager has
 only “three sous a day:” the very Emigrants, it is said, will
 take silver-plate,—by way of revenge. Clermont, Sainte-Menehould,
 Varennes especially, ye Towns of the _Night of Spurs;_ tremble
 ye! Procureur Sausse and the Magistracy of Varennes have fled;
 brave Boniface Le Blanc of the _Bras d’Or_ is to the woods: Mrs.
 Le Blanc, a young woman fair to look upon, with her young infant,
 has to live in greenwood, like a beautiful Bessy Bell of Song,
 her bower thatched with rushes;—catching premature
 rheumatism.[523] Clermont may ring the tocsin now, and illuminate
 itself! Clermont lies at the foot of its _Cow_ (or _Vache_, so
 they name that Mountain), a prey to the Hessian spoiler: its fair
 women, fairer than most, are robbed: not of life, or what is
 dearer, yet of all that is cheaper and portable; for Necessity,
 on three half-pence a-day, has no law. At Saint-Menehould, the
 enemy has been expected more than once,—our Nationals all turning
 out in arms; but was not yet seen. Post-master Drouet, he is not
 in the woods, but minding his Election; and will sit in the
 Convention, notable King-taker, and bold Old-Dragoon as he is. Thus on the North-East all roams and runs; and on a set day, the
 _date_ of which is irrecoverable by History, Brunswick “has
 engaged to dine in Paris,”—the Powers willing. And at Paris, in
 the centre, it is as we saw; and in La Vendée, South-West, it is
 as we saw; and Sardinia is in the South-East, and Spain is in the
 South, and Clairfait with Austria and sieged Thionville is in the
 North;—and all France leaps distracted, like the winnowed Sahara
 waltzing in sand-colonnades! More desperate posture no country
 ever stood in. A country, one would say, which the Majesty of
 Prussia (if it so pleased him) might partition, and clip in
 pieces, like a Poland; flinging the remainder to poor Brother
 Louis,—with directions to keep it quiet, or else _we_ will keep
 it for him! Or perhaps the Upper Powers, minded that a new Chapter in
 Universal History shall begin here and not further on, may have
 ordered it all otherwise? In that case, Brunswick will not dine
 in Paris on the set day; nor, indeed, one knows not when!—Verily,
 amid this wreckage, where poor France seems grinding itself down
 to dust and bottomless ruin, who knows what miraculous
 salient-point of Deliverance and New-life may have already come
 into existence there; and be already working there, though as yet
 human eye discern it not! On the night of that same twenty-eighth
 of August, the unpromising Review-day in Sedan, Dumouriez
 assembles a Council of War at his lodgings there. He spreads out
 the map of this forlorn war-district: Prussians here, Austrians
 there; triumphant both, with broad highway, and little
 hinderance, all the way to Paris; we, scattered helpless, here
 and here: what to advise? The Generals, strangers to Dumouriez,
 look blank enough; know not well what to advise,—if it be not
 retreating, and retreating till our recruits accumulate; till
 perhaps the chapter of chances turn up some leaf for us; or
 Paris, at all events, be sacked at the latest day possible. The
 Many-counselled, who “has not closed an eye for three nights,”
 listens with little speech to these long cheerless speeches;
 merely watching the speaker that he may know him; then wishes
 them all good-night;—but beckons a certain young Thouvenot, the
 fire of whose looks had pleased him, to wait a moment. Thouvenot
 waits: _Voilà_, says Polymetis, pointing to the map! That is the
 Forest of Argonne, that long stripe of rocky Mountain and wild
 Wood; forty miles long; with but five, or say even three
 practicable Passes through it: this, for they have forgotten it,
 might one not still seize, though Clairfait sits so nigh? Once
 seized;—the Champagne called the Hungry (or worse, Champagne
 _Pouilleuse_) on their side of it; the fat Three Bishoprics, and
 willing France, on ours; and the Equinox-rains not far;—this
 Argonne “might be the Thermopylae of France!”[524] O brisk Dumouriez Polymetis with thy teeming head, may the gods
 grant it!—Polymetis, at any rate, folds his map together, and
 flings himself on bed; resolved to try, on the morrow morning.
 With astucity, with swiftness, with audacity! One had need to be
 a lion-fox, and have luck on one’s side.
 Chapter 3.1.IV.
 September in Paris. At Paris, by lying Rumour which proved prophetic and veridical,
 the fall of Verdun was known some hours _before_ it happened. It
 is Sunday the second of September; handiwork hinders not the
 speculations of the mind. Verdun gone (though some still deny
 it); the Prussians in full march, with gallows-ropes, with fire
 and faggot! Thirty thousand Aristocrats within our own walls; and
 but the merest quarter-tithe of them yet put in Prison! Nay there
 goes a word that even these will revolt. Sieur Jean Julien,
 wagoner of Vaugirard,[525] being set in the Pillory last Friday,
 took all at once to crying, That he would be well revenged ere
 long; that the King’s Friends in Prison would burst out; force
 the Temple, set the King on horseback; and, joined by the
 unimprisoned, ride roughshod over us all. This the unfortunate
 wagoner of Vaugirard did bawl, at the top of his lungs: when
 snatched off to the Townhall, he persisted in it, still bawling;
 yesternight, when they guillotined him, he died with the froth of
 it on his lips.[526] For a man’s mind, padlocked to the Pillory,
 may go mad; and all men’s minds may go mad; and “believe him,” as
 the frenetic will do, “_because_ it is impossible.” So that apparently the knot of the crisis, and last agony of
 France is come? Make front to this, thou Improvised Commune,
 strong Danton, whatsoever man is strong! Readers can judge
 whether the Flag of Country in Danger flapped soothing or
 distractively on the souls of men, that day. But the Improvised Commune, but strong Danton is not wanting,
 each after his kind. Huge Placards are getting plastered to the
 walls; at two o’clock the stormbell shall be sounded, the
 alarm-cannon fired; all Paris shall rush to the Champ-de-Mars,
 and have itself enrolled. Unarmed, truly, and undrilled; but
 desperate, in the strength of frenzy. Haste, ye men; ye very
 women, offer to mount guard and shoulder the brown musket: weak
 clucking-hens, in a state of desperation, will fly at the muzzle
 of the mastiff, and even conquer him,—by vehemence of character!
 Terror itself, when once grown transcendental, becomes a kind of
 courage; as frost sufficiently intense, according to Poet Milton,
 will _burn_.—Danton, the other night, in the Legislative
 Committee of General Defence, when the other Ministers and
 Legislators had all opined, said, It would not do to quit Paris,
 and fly to Saumur; that they must abide by Paris; and take such
 attitude as would put their enemies in fear,—_faire peur;_ a word
 of his which has been often repeated, and reprinted—in
 italics.[527] At two of the clock, Beaurepaire, as we saw, has shot himself at
 Verdun; and over Europe, mortals are going in for afternoon
 sermon. But at Paris, all steeples are clangouring not for
 sermon; the alarm-gun booming from minute to minute;
 Champ-de-Mars and Fatherland’s Altar boiling with desperate
 terror-courage: what a _miserere_ going up to Heaven from this
 once Capital of the Most Christian King! The Legislative sits in
 alternate awe and effervescence; Vergniaud proposing that Twelve
 shall go and dig personally on Montmartre; which is decreed by
 acclaim. But better than digging personally with acclaim, see Danton
 enter;—the black brows clouded, the colossus-figure tramping
 heavy; grim energy looking from all features of the rugged man!
 Strong is that grim Son of France, and Son of Earth; a Reality
 and not a Formula he too; and surely now if ever, being hurled
 _low_ enough, it is on the Earth and on Realities that he rests.
 ‘Legislators!’ so speaks the stentor-voice, as the Newspapers yet
 preserve it for us, ‘it is not the alarm-cannon that you hear: it
 is the _pas-de-charge_ against our enemies. To conquer them, to
 hurl them back, what do we require? _Il nous faut de l’audace, et
 encore de l’audace, et toujours de l’audace_, To dare, and again
 to dare, and without end to dare!’[528]—Right so, thou brawny
 Titan; there is nothing left for thee but that. Old men, who
 heard it, will still tell you how the reverberating voice made
 all hearts swell, in that moment; and braced them to the
 sticking-place; and thrilled abroad over France, like electric
 virtue, as a word spoken in season. But the Commune, enrolling in the Champ-de-Mars? But the
 Committee of Watchfulness, become now Committee of Public
 Salvation; whose conscience is Marat? The Commune enrolling
 enrolls many; provides Tents for them in that Mars’-Field, that
 they may march with dawn on the morrow: praise to this part of
 the Commune! To Marat and the Committee of Watchfulness not
 praise;—not even blame, such as could be meted out in these
 insufficient dialects of ours; expressive silence rather! Lone
 Marat, the man forbid, meditating long in his Cellars of refuge,
 on his Stylites Pillar, could see salvation in one thing only: in
 the fall of “two hundred and sixty thousand Aristocrat heads.”
 With so many score of Naples Bravoes, each a dirk in his
 right-hand, a muff on his left, he would traverse France, and do
 it. But the world laughed, mocking the severe-benevolence of a
 People’s-Friend; and his idea could not become an action, but
 only a fixed-idea. Lo, now, however, he has come down from his
 Stylites Pillar, to a _Tribune particulière;_ here now, without
 the dirks, without the muffs at least, were it not grown
 possible,—now in the knot of the crisis, when salvation or
 destruction hangs in the hour! The Ice-Tower of Avignon was noised of sufficiently, and lives in
 all memories; but the authors were not punished: nay we saw
 Jourdan Coupe-tete, borne on men’s shoulders, like a copper
 Portent, “traversing the cities of the South.”—What phantasms,
 squalid-horrid, shaking their dirk and muff, may dance through
 the brain of a Marat, in this dizzy pealing of tocsin-miserere,
 and universal frenzy, seek not to guess, O Reader! Nor what the
 cruel Billaud “in his short brown coat was thinking;” nor
 Sergent, not yet _Agate_-Sergent; nor Panis the confident of
 Danton;—nor, in a word, how gloomy Orcus does breed in her gloomy
 womb, and fashion her monsters, and prodigies of Events, which
 thou seest her visibly bear! Terror is on these streets of Paris;
 terror and rage, tears and frenzy: tocsin-miserere pealing
 through the air; fierce desperation rushing to battle; mothers,
 with streaming eyes and wild hearts, sending forth their sons to
 die. “Carriage-horses are seized by the bridle,” that they may
 draw cannon; “the traces cut, the carriages left standing.” In
 such tocsin-miserere, and murky bewilderment of Frenzy, are not
 Murder, Ate, and all Furies near at hand? On slight hint, who
 knows on how slight, may not Murder come; and, with _her_
 snaky-sparkling hand, illuminate this murk! How it was and went, what part might be premeditated, what was
 improvised and accidental, man will never know, till the great
 Day of Judgment make it known. But with a Marat for keeper of the
 Sovereign’s Conscience—And we know what the _ultima ratio_ of
 Sovereigns, when they are driven to it, is! In this Paris there
 are as many wicked men, say a hundred or more, as exist in all
 the Earth: to be hired, and set on; to set on, of their own
 accord, unhired.—And yet we will remark that premeditation itself
 is not performance, is not surety of performance; that it is
 perhaps, at most, surety of _letting_ whosoever wills perform.
 From the purpose of crime to the act of crime there is an abyss;
 wonderful to think of. The finger lies on the pistol; but the man
 is not yet a murderer: nay, his whole nature staggering at such
 consummation, is there not a confused pause rather,—one last
 instant of possibility for him? Not yet a murderer; it is at the
 mercy of light trifles whether the most fixed idea may not yet
 become unfixed. One slight twitch of a muscle, the death flash
 bursts; and he is it, and will for Eternity be it;—and Earth has
 become a penal Tartarus for him; his horizon girdled now not with
 golden hope, but with red flames of remorse; voices from the
 depths of Nature sounding, Wo, wo on him! Of such stuff are we all made; on such powder-mines of bottomless
 guilt and criminality, “if God restrained not; as is well
 said,—does the purest of us walk. There are depths in man that go
 the length of lowest Hell, as there are heights that reach
 highest Heaven;—for are not both Heaven and Hell made out of him,
 made by him, everlasting Miracle and Mystery as he is?—But
 looking on this Champ-de-Mars, with its tent-buildings, and
 frantic enrolments; on this murky-simmering Paris, with its
 crammed Prisons (supposed about to burst), with its
 tocsin-miserere, its mothers’ tears, and soldiers’ farewell
 shoutings,—the pious soul might have prayed, that day, that God’s
 grace would restrain, and greatly restrain; lest on slight hest
 or hint, Madness, Horror and Murder rose, and this Sabbath-day of
 September became a Day black in the Annals of Men.— The tocsin is pealing its loudest, the clocks inaudibly striking
 _Three_, when poor Abbé Sicard, with some thirty other Nonjurant
 Priests, in six carriages, fare along the streets, from their
 preliminary House of Detention at the Townhall, westward towards
 the Prison of the Abbaye. Carriages enough stand deserted on the
 streets; these six move on,—through angry multitudes, cursing as
 they move. Accursed Aristocrat Tartuffes, this is the pass ye
 have brought us to! And now ye will break the Prisons, and set
 Capet Veto on horseback to ride over us? Out upon you, Priests of
 Beelzebub and Moloch; of Tartuffery, Mammon, and the Prussian
 Gallows,—which ye name Mother-Church and God! Such reproaches
 have the poor Nonjurants to endure, and worse; spoken in on them
 by frantic Patriots, who mount even on the carriage-steps; the
 very Guards hardly refraining. Pull up your carriage-blinds!—No!
 answers Patriotism, clapping its horny paw on the carriage blind,
 and crushing it down again. Patience in oppression has limits: we
 are close on the Abbaye, it has lasted long: a poor Nonjurant, of
 quicker temper, smites the horny paw with his cane; nay, finding
 solacement in it, smites the unkempt head, sharply and again more
 sharply, twice over,—seen clearly of us and of the world. It is
 the last that we see clearly. Alas, next moment, the carriages
 are locked and blocked in endless raging tumults; in yells deaf
 to the cry for mercy, which answer the cry for mercy with
 sabre-thrusts through the heart.[529] The thirty Priests are torn
 out, are massacred about the Prison-Gate, one after one,—only the
 poor Abbé Sicard, whom one Moton a watchmaker, knowing him,
 heroically tried to save, and secrete in the Prison, escapes to
 tell;—and it is Night and Orcus, and Murder’s snaky-sparkling
 head _has_ risen in the murk!— From Sunday afternoon (exclusive of intervals, and pauses not
 final) till Thursday evening, there follow consecutively a
 Hundred Hours. Which hundred hours are to be reckoned with the
 hours of the Bartholomew Butchery, of the Armagnac Massacres,
 Sicilian Vespers, or whatsoever is savagest in the annals of this
 world. Horrible the hour when man’s soul, in its paroxysm, spurns
 asunder the barriers and rules; and shews what dens and depths
 are in it! For Night and Orcus, as we say, as was long
 prophesied, have burst forth, here in this Paris, from their
 subterranean imprisonment: hideous, dim, confused; which it is
 painful to look on; and yet which cannot, and indeed which should
 not, be forgotten. The Reader, who looks earnestly through this dim Phantasmagory of
 the Pit, will discern few fixed certain objects; and yet still a
 few. He will observe, in this Abbaye Prison, the sudden massacre
 of the Priests being once over, a strange Court of Justice, or
 call it Court of Revenge and Wild-Justice, swiftly fashion
 itself, and take seat round a table, with the Prison-Registers
 spread before it;—Stanislas Maillard, Bastille-hero, famed Leader
 of the Menads, presiding. O Stanislas, one hoped to meet thee
 elsewhere than here; thou shifty Riding-Usher, with an inkling of
 Law! This work also thou hadst to do; and then—to depart for ever
 from our eyes. At _La Force_, at the _Châtelet_, the
 _Conciergerie_, the like Court forms itself, with the like
 accompaniments: the thing that one man does other men can do.
 There are some Seven Prisons in Paris, full of Aristocrats with
 conspiracies;—nay not even _Bicêtre_ and _Salpêtrière_ shall
 escape, with their Forgers of Assignats: and there are seventy
 times seven hundred Patriot hearts in a state of frenzy.
 Scoundrel hearts also there are; as perfect, say, as the Earth
 holds,—if such are needed. To whom, in this mood, law is as
 no-law; and killing, by what name soever called, is but work to
 be done. So sit these sudden Courts of Wild-Justice, with the
 Prison-Registers before them; unwonted wild tumult howling all
 round: the Prisoners in dread expectancy within. Swift: a name is
 called; bolts jingle, a Prisoner is there. A few questions are
 put; swiftly this sudden Jury decides: Royalist Plotter or not?
 Clearly not; in that case, Let the Prisoner be enlarged With
 _Vive la Nation_. Probably yea; then still, Let the Prisoner be
 enlarged, but without _Vive la Nation;_ or else it may run, Let
 the prisoner be conducted to La Force. At La Force again their
 formula is, Let the Prisoner be conducted to the Abbaye.—‘To La
 Force then!’ Volunteer bailiffs seize the doomed man; he is at
 the outer gate; “enlarged,” or “conducted,”—not into La Force,
 but into a howling sea; forth, under an arch of wild sabres, axes
 and pikes; and sinks, hewn asunder. And another sinks, and
 another; and there forms itself a piled heap of corpses, and the
 kennels begin to run red. Fancy the yells of these men, their
 faces of sweat and blood; the crueller shrieks of these women,
 for there are women too; and a fellow-mortal hurled naked into it
 all! Jourgniac de Saint Méard has seen battle, has seen an
 effervescent Regiment du Roi in mutiny; but the bravest heart may
 quail at this. The Swiss Prisoners, remnants of the Tenth of
 August, “clasped each other spasmodically,” and hung back; grey
 veterans crying: ‘Mercy Messieurs; ah, mercy!’ But there was no
 mercy. Suddenly, however, one of these men steps forward. He had
 a blue frock coat; he seemed to be about thirty, his stature was
 above common, his look noble and martial. ‘I go first,’ said he,
 ‘since it must be so: adieu!’ Then dashing his hat sharply behind
 him: ‘Which way?’ cried he to the Brigands: ‘Shew it me, then.’
 They open the folding gate; he is announced to the multitude. He
 stands a moment motionless; then plunges forth among the pikes,
 and dies of a thousand wounds.”[530] Man after man is cut down; the sabres need sharpening, the
 killers refresh themselves from wine jugs. Onward and onward goes
 the butchery; the loud yells wearying down into bass growls. A
 sombre-faced, shifting multitude looks on; in dull approval, or
 dull disapproval; in dull recognition that it is Necessity. “An
 _Anglais_ in drab greatcoat” was seen, or seemed to be seen,
 serving liquor from his own dram-bottle;—for what purpose, “if
 not set on by Pitt,” Satan and himself know best! Witty Dr. Moore
 grew sick on approaching, and turned into another
 street.[531]—Quick enough goes this Jury-Court; and rigorous. The
 brave are not spared, nor the beautiful, nor the weak. Old M. de
 Montmorin, the Minister’s Brother, was acquitted by the Tribunal
 of the Seventeenth; and conducted back, elbowed by howling
 galleries; but is not acquitted here. Princess de Lamballe has
 lain down on bed: ‘Madame, you are to be removed to the Abbaye.’
 ‘I do not wish to remove; I am well enough here.’ There is a
 need-be for removing. She will arrange her dress a little, then;
 rude voices answer, ‘You have not far to go.’ She too is led to
 the hell-gate; a manifest Queen’s-Friend. She shivers back, at
 the sight of bloody sabres; but there is no return: Onwards! That
 fair hindhead is cleft with the axe; the neck is severed. That
 fair body is cut in fragments; with indignities, and obscene
 horrors of moustachio _grands-lèvres_, which human nature would
 fain find incredible,—which shall be read in the original
 language only. She was beautiful, she was good, she had known no
 happiness. Young hearts, generation after generation, will think
 with themselves: O worthy of worship, thou king-descended,
 god-descended and poor sister-woman! why was not I there; and
 some Sword Balmung, or Thor’s Hammer in my hand? Her head is
 fixed on a pike; paraded under the windows of the Temple; that a
 still more hated, a Marie-Antoinette, may see. One Municipal, in
 the Temple with the Royal Prisoners at the moment, said, ‘Look
 out.’ Another eagerly whispered, ‘Do not look.’ The circuit of
 the Temple is guarded, in these hours, by a long stretched
 tricolor riband: terror enters, and the clangour of infinite
 tumult: hitherto not regicide, though that too may come. But it is more edifying to note what thrillings of affection,
 what fragments of wild virtues turn up, in this shaking asunder
 of man’s existence, for of these too there is a proportion. Note
 old Marquis Cazotte: he is doomed to die; but his young Daughter
 clasps him in her arms, with an inspiration of eloquence, with a
 love which is stronger than very death; the heart of the killers
 themselves is touched by it; the old man is spared. Yet he was
 guilty, if plotting for his King is guilt: in ten days more, a
 Court of Law condemned him, and he had to die elsewhere;
 bequeathing his Daughter a lock of his old grey hair. Or note old
 M. de Sombreuil, who also had a Daughter:—My Father is not an
 Aristocrat; O good gentlemen, I will swear it, and testify it,
 and in all ways prove it; we are not; we hate Aristocrats! ‘Wilt
 thou drink Aristocrats’ blood?’ The man lifts blood (if universal
 Rumour can be credited);[532] the poor maiden does drink. ‘This
 Sombreuil is innocent then!’ Yes indeed,—and now note, most of
 all, how the bloody pikes, at this news, do rattle to the ground;
 and the tiger-yells become bursts of jubilee over a brother
 saved; and the old man and his daughter are clasped to bloody
 bosoms, with hot tears, and borne home in triumph of _Vive la
 Nation_, the killers refusing even money! Does it seem strange,
 this temper of theirs? It seems very certain, well proved by
 Royalist testimony in other instances;[533] and very significant.
 Chapter 3.1.V.
 A Trilogy. As all Delineation, in these ages, were it never so Epic,
 “speaking itself and not singing itself,” must either found on
 Belief and provable Fact, or have no foundation at all (nor
 except as floating cobweb any existence at all),—the Reader will
 perhaps prefer to take a glance with the very eyes of
 eye-witnesses; and see, in that way, for himself, how it was.
 Brave Jourgniac, innocent Abbé Sicard, judicious Advocate Maton,
 these, greatly compressing themselves, shall speak, each an
 instant. Jourgniac’s _Agony of Thirty-eight Hours_ went through
 “above a hundred editions,” though intrinsically a poor work.
 Some portion of it may here go through above the
 hundred-and-first, for want of a better. “_Towards seven o’clock_” (Sunday night, at the Abbaye; for
 Jourgniac goes by dates): “We saw two men enter, their hands
 bloody and armed with sabres; a turnkey, with a torch, lighted
 them; he pointed to the bed of the unfortunate Swiss, Reding.
 Reding spoke with a dying voice. One of them paused; but the
 other cried _Allons donc;_ lifted the unfortunate man; carried
 him out on his back to the street. He was massacred there. “We all looked at one another in silence, we clasped each other’s
 hands. Motionless, with fixed eyes, we gazed on the pavement of
 our prison; on which lay the moonlight, checkered with the triple
 stancheons of our windows.');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' “_Three in the morning:_ They were breaking-in one of the
 prison-doors. We at first thought they were coming to kill us in
 our room; but heard, by voices on the staircase, that it was a
 room where some Prisoners had barricaded themselves. They were
 all butchered there, as we shortly gathered. “_Ten o’clock:_ The Abbé Lenfant and the Abbé de Chapt-Rastignac
 appeared in the pulpit of the Chapel, which was our prison; they
 had entered by a door from the stairs. They said to us that our
 end was at hand; that we must compose ourselves, and receive
 their last blessing. An electric movement, not to be defined,
 threw us all on our knees, and we received it. These two
 whitehaired old men, blessing us from their place above; death
 hovering over our heads, on all hands environing us; the moment
 is never to be forgotten. Half an hour after, they were both
 massacred, and we heard their cries.”[534]—Thus Jourgniac in his
 _Agony_ in the Abbaye. But now let the good Maton speak, what he, over in La Force, in
 the same hours, is suffering and witnessing. This _Résurrection_
 by him is greatly the best, the least theatrical of these
 Pamphlets; and stands testing by documents: “Towards seven o’clock,” on Sunday night, “prisoners were called
 frequently, and they did not reappear. Each of us reasoned in his
 own way, on this singularity: but our ideas became calm, as we
 persuaded ourselves that the Memorial I had drawn up for the
 National Assembly was producing effect. “At one in the morning, the grate which led to our quarter opened
 anew. Four men in uniform, each with a drawn sabre and blazing
 torch, came up to our corridor, preceded by a turnkey; and
 entered an apartment close to ours, to investigate a box there,
 which we heard them break up. This done, they stept into the
 gallery, and questioned the man Cuissa, to know where Lamotte
 (Necklace’s Widower) was. Lamotte, they said, had some months
 ago, under pretext of a treasure he knew of, swindled a sum of
 three-hundred livres from one of them, inviting him to dinner for
 that purpose. The wretched Cuissa, now in their hands, who indeed
 lost his life this night, answered trembling, That he remembered
 the fact well, but could not tell what was become of Lamotte.
 Determined to find Lamotte and confront him with Cuissa, they
 rummaged, along with this latter, through various other
 apartments; but without effect, for we heard them say: ‘Come
 search among the corpses then: for, _nom de Dieu!_ we must find
 where he is.’ “At this time, I heard Louis Bardy, the Abbé Bardy’s name called:
 he was brought out; and directly massacred, as I learnt. He had
 been accused, along with his concubine, five or six years before,
 of having murdered and cut in pieces his own Brother, Auditor of
 the _Chambre des Comptes_ of Montpelier; but had by his subtlety,
 his dexterity, nay his eloquence, outwitted the judges, and
 escaped. “One may fancy what terror these words, ‘Come search among the
 corpses then,’ had thrown me into. I saw nothing for it now but
 resigning myself to die. I wrote my last-will; concluding it by a
 petition and adjuration, that the paper should be sent to its
 address. Scarcely had I quitted the pen, when there came two
 other men in uniform; one of them, whose arm and sleeve up to the
 very shoulder, as well as the sabre, were covered with blood,
 said, He was as weary as a hodman that had been beating plaster. “Baudin de la Chenaye was called; sixty years of virtues could
 not save him. They said, ‘_À l’Abbaye:_’ he passed the fatal
 outer-gate; gave a cry of terror, at sight of the heaped corpses;
 covered his eyes with his hands, and died of innumerable wounds.
 At every new opening of the grate, I thought I should hear my own
 name called, and see Rossignol enter. “I flung off my nightgown and cap; I put on a coarse unwashed
 shirt, a worn frock without waistcoat, an old round hat; these
 things I had sent for, some days ago, in the fear of what might
 happen. “The rooms of this corridor had been all emptied but ours. We
 were four together; whom they seemed to have forgotten: we
 addressed our prayers in common to the Eternal to be delivered
 from this peril. “Baptiste the turnkey came up by himself, to see us. I took him
 by the hands; I conjured him to save us; promised him a hundred
 louis, if he would conduct me home. A noise coming from the
 grates made him hastily withdraw. “It was the noise of some dozen or fifteen men, armed to the
 teeth; as we, lying flat to escape being seen, could see from our
 windows: ‘Up stairs!’ said they: ‘Let not one remain.’ I took out
 my penknife; I considered where I should strike myself,”—but
 reflected “that the blade was too short,” and also “on religion.” Finally, however, between seven and eight o’clock in the morning,
 enter four men with bludgeons and sabres!—“to one of whom Gerard
 my comrade whispered, earnestly, apart. During their colloquy I
 searched every where for shoes, that I might lay off the Advocate
 pumps (_pantoufles de Palais_) I had on,” but could find
 none.—“Constant, called le Sauvage, Gerard, and a third whose
 name escapes me, they let clear off: as for me, four sabres were
 crossed over my breast, and they led me down. I was brought to
 their bar; to the Personage with the scarf, who sat as judge
 there. He was a lame man, of tall lank stature. He recognised me
 on the streets, and spoke to me seven months after. I have been
 assured that he was son of a retired attorney, and named Chepy.
 Crossing the Court called _Des Nourrices_, I saw Manuel
 haranguing in tricolor scarf.” The trial, as we see, ends in
 acquittal and _resurrection_.[535] Poor Sicard, from the _violon_ of the Abbaye, shall say but a few
 words; true-looking, though tremulous. Towards three in the
 morning, the killers bethink them of this little _violon;_ and
 knock from the court. “I tapped gently, trembling lest the
 murderers might hear, on the opposite door, where the Section
 Committee was sitting: they answered gruffly that they had no
 key. There were three of us in this _violon;_ my companions
 thought they perceived a kind of loft overhead. But it was very
 high; only one of us could reach it, by mounting on the shoulders
 of both the others. One of them said to me, that my life was
 usefuller than theirs: I resisted, they insisted: no denial! I
 fling myself on the neck of these two deliverers; never was scene
 more touching. I mount on the shoulders of the first, then on
 those of the second, finally on the loft; and address to my two
 comrades the expression of a soul overwhelmed with natural
 emotions.[536] The two generous companions, we rejoice to find, did not perish.
 But it is time that Jourgniac de Saint-Méard should speak his
 last words, and end this singular trilogy. The night had become
 day; and the day has again become night. Jourgniac, worn down
 with uttermost agitation, has fallen asleep, and had a cheering
 dream: he has also contrived to make acquaintance with one of the
 volunteer bailiffs, and spoken in native Provençal with him. On
 Tuesday, about one in the morning, his _Agony_ is reaching its
 crisis. “By the glare of two torches, I now descried the terrible
 tribunal, where lay my life or my death. The President, in grey
 coats, with a sabre at his side, stood leaning with his hands
 against a table, on which were papers, an inkstand, tobacco-pipes
 and bottles. Some ten persons were around, seated or standing;
 two of whom had jackets and aprons: others were sleeping
 stretched on benches. Two men, in bloody shirts, guarded the door
 of the place; an old turnkey had his hand on the lock. In front
 of the President, three men held a Prisoner, who might be about
 sixty” (or seventy: he was old Marshal Maillé, of the Tuileries
 and August Tenth). “They stationed me in a corner; my guards
 crossed their sabres on my breast. I looked on all sides for my
 Provençal: two National Guards, one of them drunk, presented some
 appeal from the Section of Croix Rouge in favour of the Prisoner;
 the Man in Grey answered: ‘They are useless, these appeals for
 traitors.’ Then the Prisoner exclaimed: ‘It is frightful; your
 judgment is a murder.’ The President answered; ‘My hands are
 washed of it; take M. Maillé away.’ They drove him into the
 street; where, through the opening of the door, I saw him
 massacred. “The President sat down to write; registering, I suppose, the
 name of this one whom they had finished; then I heard him say:
 ‘Another, _À un autre!_’ “Behold me then haled before this swift and bloody judgment-bar,
 where the best protection was to have no protection, and all
 resources of ingenuity became null if they were not founded on
 truth. Two of my guards held me each by a hand, the third by the
 collar of my coat. ‘Your name, your profession?’ said the
 President. ‘The smallest lie ruins you,’ added one of the
 judges,—‘My name is Jourgniac Saint-Méard; I have served, as an
 officer, twenty years: and I appear at your tribunal with the
 assurance of an innocent man, who therefore will not lie.’—‘We
 shall see that,’ said the President: ‘Do you know why you are
 arrested?’—‘Yes, Monsieur le President; I am accused of editing
 the Journal _De la Cour et de la Ville_. But I hope to prove the
 falsity’”— But no; Jourgniac’s proof of the falsity, and defence generally,
 though of excellent result as a defence, is not interesting to
 read. It is long-winded; there is a loose theatricality in the
 reporting of it, which does not amount to unveracity, yet which
 tends that way. We shall suppose him successful, beyond hope, in
 proving and disproving; and skip largely,—to the catastrophe,
 almost at two steps. “‘But after all,’ said one of the Judges, ‘there is no smoke
 without kindling; tell us why they accuse you of that.’—‘I was
 about to do so’”—Jourgniac does so; with more and more success. “‘Nay,’ continued I, ‘they accuse me even of recruiting for the
 Emigrants!’ At these words there arose a general murmur. ‘O
 Messieurs, Messieurs,’ I exclaimed, raising my voice, ‘it is my
 turn to speak; I beg M. le President to have the kindness to
 maintain it for me; I never needed it more.’—‘True enough, true
 enough,’ said almost all the judges with a laugh: ‘Silence!’ “While they were examining the testimonials I had produced, a new
 Prisoner was brought in, and placed before the President. ‘It was
 one Priest more,’ they said, ‘whom they had ferreted out of the
 Chapelle.’ After very few questions: ‘_À la Force!_’ He flung his
 breviary on the table: was hurled forth, and massacred. I
 reappeared before the tribunal. “‘You tell us always,’ cried one of the judges, with a tone of
 impatience, ‘that you are not this, that you are not that: what
 are you then?’—‘I was an open Royalist.’—There arose a general
 murmur; which was miraculously appeased by another of the men,
 who had seemed to take an interest in me: ‘We are not here to
 judge opinions,’ said he, ‘but to judge the results of them.’
 Could Rousseau and Voltaire both in one, pleading for me, have
 said better?—‘Yes, Messieurs,’ cried I, ‘always till the Tenth of
 August, I was an open Royalist. Ever since the Tenth of August
 that cause has been finished. I am a Frenchman, true to my
 country. I was always a man of honour.’ “‘My soldiers never distrusted me. Nay, two days before that
 business of Nanci, when their suspicion of their officers was at
 its height, they chose me for commander, to lead them to
 Lunéville, to get back the prisoners of the Regiment
 Mestre-de-Camp, and seize General Malseigne.’” Which fact there
 is, most luckily, an individual present who by a certain token
 can confirm. “The President, this cross-questioning being over, took off his
 hat and said: ‘I see nothing to suspect in this man; I am for
 granting him his liberty. Is that your vote?’ To which all the
 judges answered: ‘_Oui, oui;_ it is just!’” And there arose vivats within doors and without; “escort of
 three,” amid shoutings and embracings: thus Jourgniac escaped
 from jury-trial and the jaws of death.[537] Maton and Sicard did,
 either by trial, and no bill found, lank President Chepy finding
 “absolutely nothing;” or else by evasion, and new favour of Moton
 the brave watchmaker, likewise escape; and were embraced, and
 wept over; weeping in return, as they well might. Thus they three, in wondrous trilogy, or triple soliloquy;
 uttering simultaneously, through the dread night-watches, their
 Night-thoughts,—grown audible to us! They Three are become
 audible: but the other “Thousand and Eighty-nine, of whom Two
 Hundred and Two were Priests,” who also had Night-thoughts,
 remain inaudible; choked for ever in black Death. Heard only of
 President Chepy and the Man in Grey!—
 Chapter 3.1.VI.
 The Circular. But the Constituted Authorities, all this while? The Legislative
 Assembly; the Six Ministers; the Townhall; Santerre with the
 National Guard?—It is very curious to think what a City is.
 Theatres, to the number of some twenty-three, were open every
 night during these prodigies: while right-arms here grew weary
 with slaying, right-arms there are twiddledeeing on melodious
 catgut; at the very instant when Abbé Sicard was clambering up
 his second pair of shoulders, three-men high, five hundred
 thousand human individuals were lying horizontal, as if nothing
 were amiss. As for the poor Legislative, the sceptre had departed from it.
 The Legislative did send Deputation to the Prisons, to the
 Street-Courts; and poor M. Dusaulx did harangue there; but
 produced no conviction whatsoever: nay, at last, as he continued
 haranguing, the Street-Court interposed, not without threats; and
 he had to cease, and withdraw. This is the same poor worthy old
 M. Dusaulx who told, or indeed almost sang (though with cracked
 voice), the _Taking of the Bastille_,—to our satisfaction long
 since. He was wont to announce himself, on such and on all
 occasions, as _the Translator of Juvenal_. ‘Good Citizens, you
 see before you a man who loves his country, who is the Translator
 of Juvenal,’ said he once.—‘Juvenal?’ interrupts Sansculottism:
 ‘who the devil is Juvenal? One of your _sacrés Aristocrates?_ To
 the _Lanterne!_’ From an orator of this kind, conviction was not
 to be expected. The Legislative had much ado to save one of its
 own Members, or Ex-Members, Deputy Journeau, who chanced to be
 lying in arrest for mere Parliamentary delinquencies, in these
 Prisons. As for poor old Dusaulx and Company, they returned to
 the Salle de Manége, saying, ‘It was dark; and they could not see
 well what was going on.’[538] Roland writes indignant messages, in the name of Order, Humanity,
 and the Law; but there is no Force at his disposal. Santerre’s
 National Force seems lazy to rise; though he made requisitions,
 he says,—which always dispersed again. Nay did not we, with
 Advocate Maton’s eyes, see ‘men in uniform,’ too, with their
 ‘sleeves bloody to the shoulder?’ Pétion goes in tricolor scarf;
 speaks ‘the austere language of the law:’ the killers give up,
 while he is there; when his back is turned, recommence. Manuel
 too in scarf we, with Maton’s eyes, transiently saw haranguing,
 in the Court called of Nurses, _Cour des Nourrices_. On the other
 hand, cruel Billaud, likewise in scarf, “with that small puce
 coat and black wig we are used to on him,”[539] audibly delivers,
 “standing among corpses,” at the Abbaye, a short but
 ever-memorable harangue, reported in various phraseology, but
 always to this purpose: ‘Brave Citizens, you are extirpating the
 Enemies of Liberty; you are at your duty. A grateful Commune, and
 Country, would wish to recompense you adequately; but cannot, for
 you know its want of funds. Whoever shall have worked
 (_travaillé_) in a Prison shall receive a draft of one louis,
 payable by our cashier. Continue your work.’[540]—The Constituted
 Authorities are of yesterday; all pulling different ways: there
 is properly not Constituted Authority, but every man is his own
 King; and all are kinglets, belligerent, allied, or
 armed-neutral, without king over them. “O everlasting infamy,” exclaims Montgaillard, “that Paris stood
 looking on in stupor for four days, and did not interfere!” Very
 desirable indeed that Paris had interfered; yet not unnatural
 that it stood even so, looking on in stupor. Paris is in
 death-panic, the enemy and gibbets at its door: whosoever in
 Paris has the heart to front death finds it more pressing to do
 it fighting the Prussians, than fighting the killers of
 Aristocrats. Indignant abhorrence, as in Roland, may be here;
 gloomy sanction, premeditation or not, as in Marat and Committee
 of Salvation, may be there; dull disapproval, dull approval, and
 acquiescence in Necessity and Destiny, is the general temper. The
 Sons of Darkness, “two hundred or so,” risen from their
 lurking-places, have scope to do their work. Urged on by
 fever-frenzy of Patriotism, and the madness of Terror;—urged on
 by lucre, and the gold louis of wages? Nay, not lucre: for the
 gold watches, rings, money of the Massacred, are punctually
 brought to the Townhall, by Killers sans-indispensables, who
 higgle afterwards for their twenty shillings of wages; and
 Sergent sticking an uncommonly fine agate on his finger (“fully
 meaning to account for it”), becomes _Agate_-Sergent. But the
 temper, as we say, is dull acquiescence. Not till the Patriotic
 or Frenetic part of the work is finished for want of material;
 and Sons of Darkness, bent clearly on lucre alone, begin
 wrenching watches and purses, brooches from ladies’ necks “to
 equip volunteers,” in daylight, on the streets,—does the temper
 from dull grow vehement; does the Constable raise his truncheon,
 and striking heartily (like a cattle-driver in earnest) beat the
 “course of things” back into its old regulated drove-roads. The
 _Garde-Meuble_ itself was surreptitiously plundered, on the 17th
 of the Month, to Roland’s new horror; who anew bestirs himself,
 and is, as Sieyes says, “the veto of scoundrels,” Roland _veto
 des coquins_.[541]— This is the September Massacre, otherwise called “Severe Justice
 of the People.” These are the Septemberers (_Septembriseurs_); a
 name of some note and lucency,—but lucency of the Nether-fire
 sort; very different from that of our Bastille Heroes, who shone,
 disputable by no Friend of Freedom, as in heavenly
 light-radiance: to such phasis of the business have we advanced
 since then! The numbers massacred are, in Historical _fantasy_,
 “between two and three thousand;” or indeed they are “upwards of
 six thousand,” for Peltier (in vision) saw them massacring the
 very patients of the Bicêtre Madhouse “with grape-shot;” nay
 finally they are “twelve thousand” and odd hundreds,—not more
 than that.[542] In Arithmetical ciphers, and Lists drawn up by
 accurate Advocate Maton, the number, including two hundred and
 two priests, three “persons unknown,” and “one thief killed at
 the Bernardins,” is, as above hinted, a Thousand and
 Eighty-nine,—no less than that. A thousand and eighty-nine lie dead, “two hundred and sixty
 heaped carcasses on the Pont au Change” itself;—among which,
 Robespierre pleading afterwards will “nearly weep” to reflect
 that there was said to be one slain innocent.[543] One; not two,
 O thou seagreen Incorruptible? If so, Themis Sansculotte must be
 lucky; for she was brief!—In the dim Registers of the Townhall,
 which are preserved to this day, men read, with a certain
 sickness of heart, items and entries not usual in Town Books: “To
 workers employed in preserving the salubrity of the air in the
 Prisons, and persons “who presided over these dangerous
 operations,” so much,—in various items, nearly seven hundred
 pounds sterling. To carters employed to “the Burying-grounds of
 Clamart, Montrouge, and Vaugirard,” at so much a journey, per
 cart; this also is an entry. Then so many francs and odd sous
 “for the necessary quantity of quick-lime!”[544] Carts go along
 the streets; full of stript human corpses, thrown pellmell; limbs
 sticking up:—seest thou that cold Hand sticking up, through the
 heaped embrace of brother corpses, in its yellow paleness, in its
 cold rigour; the palm opened towards Heaven, as if in dumb
 prayer, in expostulation _de profundis_, Take pity on the Sons of
 Men!—Mercier saw it, as he walked down “the Rue Saint-Jacques
 from Montrouge, on the morrow of the Massacres:” but not a Hand;
 it was a Foot,—which he reckons still more significant, one
 understands not well why. Or was it as the Foot of one _spurning_
 Heaven? Rushing, like a wild diver, in disgust and despair,
 towards the depths of Annihilation? Even there shall His hand
 find thee, and His right-hand hold thee,—surely for right not for
 wrong, for good not evil! “I saw that Foot,” says Mercier; “I
 shall know it again at the great Day of Judgment, when the
 Eternal, throned on his thunders, shall judge both Kings and
 Septemberers.”[545] That a shriek of inarticulate horror rose over this thing, not
 only from French Aristocrats and Moderates, but from all Europe,
 and has prolonged itself to the present day, was most natural and
 right. The thing lay done, irrevocable; a thing to be counted
 besides some other things, which lie very black in our Earth’s
 Annals, yet which will not erase therefrom. For man, as was
 remarked, has transcendentalisms in him; standing, as he does,
 poor creature, every way “in the confluence of Infinitudes;” a
 mystery to himself and others: in the centre of two Eternities,
 of three Immensities,—in the intersection of primeval Light with
 the everlasting dark! Thus have there been, especially by
 vehement tempers reduced to a state of desperation, very
 miserable things done. Sicilian Vespers, and “eight thousand
 slaughtered in two hours,” are a known thing. Kings themselves,
 not in desperation, but only in difficulty, have sat hatching,
 for year and day (nay De Thou says, for seven years), their
 Bartholomew Business; and then, at the right moment, also on an
 Autumn Sunday, this very Bell (they say it is the identical
 metal) of St. Germain l’Auxerrois was set a-pealing—with
 effect.[546] Nay the same black boulder-stones of these Paris
 Prisons have seen Prison-massacres before now; men massacring
 countrymen, Burgundies massacring Armagnacs, whom they had
 suddenly imprisoned, till as now there are piled heaps of
 carcasses, and the streets ran red;—the Mayor Pétion of the time
 speaking the austere language of the law, and answered by the
 Killers, in old French (it is some four hundred years old):
 ‘_Maugré bieu, Sire_,—Sir, God’s malison on your justice, your
 pity, your right reason. Cursed be of God whoso shall have pity
 on these false traitorous Armagnacs, English; dogs they are; they
 have destroyed us, wasted this realm of France, and sold it to
 the English.’[547] And so they slay, and fling aside the slain,
 to the extent of “fifteen hundred and eighteen, among whom are
 found four Bishops of false and damnable counsel, and two
 Presidents of Parlement.” For though it is not Satan’s world this
 that we live in, Satan always has his place in it (underground
 properly); and from time to time bursts up. Well may mankind
 shriek, inarticulately anathematising as they can. There are
 actions of such emphasis that no shrieking can be too emphatic
 for them. Shriek ye; acted have they. Shriek who might in this France, in this Paris Legislative or
 Paris Townhall, there are Ten Men who do not shriek. A Circular
 goes out from the Committee of _Salut Public_, dated 3rd of
 September 1792; directed to all Townhalls: a State-paper too
 remarkable to be overlooked. “A part of the ferocious
 conspirators detained in the Prisons,” it says, “have been put to
 death by the People; and it,” the Circular, “cannot doubt but the
 whole Nation, driven to the edge of ruin by such endless series
 of treasons, will make haste to adopt _this_ means of public
 salvation; and all Frenchmen will cry as the men of Paris: We go
 to fight the enemy, but we will not leave robbers behind us, to
 butcher our wives and children.” To which are legibly appended
 these signatures: Panis, Sergent; Marat, Friend of the
 People;[548] with Seven others;—carried down thereby, in a
 strange way, to the late remembrance of Antiquarians. We remark,
 however, that their Circular rather recoiled on themselves. The
 Townhalls made no use of it; even the distracted Sansculottes
 made little; they only howled and bellowed, but did not bite. At
 Rheims “about eight persons” were killed; and two afterwards were
 hanged for doing it. At Lyons, and a few other places, some
 attempt was made; but with hardly any effect, being quickly put
 down. Less fortunate were the Prisoners of Orléans; was the good Duke
 de la Rochefoucault. He journeying, by quick stages, with his
 Mother and Wife, towards the Waters of Forges, or some quieter
 country, was arrested at Gisors; conducted along the streets,
 amid effervescing multitudes, and killed dead “by the stroke of a
 paving-stone hurled through the coach-window.” Killed as a once
 Liberal now Aristocrat; Protector of Priests, Suspender of
 virtuous Pétions, and his unfortunate Hot-grown-cold, detestable
 to Patriotism. He dies lamented of Europe; his blood spattering
 the cheeks of his old Mother, ninety-three years old. As for the Orléans Prisoners, they are State Criminals: Royalist
 Ministers, Delessarts, Montmorins; who have been accumulating on
 the High Court of Orléans, ever since that Tribunal was set up.
 Whom now it seems good that we should get transferred to our new
 Paris Court of the Seventeenth; which proceeds far quicker.
 Accordingly hot Fournier from Martinique, Fournier _l’Americain_,
 is off, missioned by Constituted Authority; with stanch National
 Guards, with Lazouski the Pole; sparingly provided with
 road-money. These, through bad quarters, through difficulties,
 perils, for Authorities cross each other in this time,—do
 triumphantly bring off the Fifty or Fifty-three Orléans
 Prisoners, towards Paris; where a swifter Court of the
 Seventeenth will do justice on them.[549] But lo, at Paris, in
 the interim, a still swifter and swiftest Court of the _Second_,
 and of _September_, has instituted itself: enter not Paris, or
 that will judge you!—What shall hot Fournier do? It was his duty,
 as volunteer Constable, had he been a perfect character, to guard
 those men’s lives never so Aristocratic, at the expense of his
 own valuable life never so Sansculottic, till some Constituted
 Court had disposed of them. But he was an imperfect character and
 Constable; perhaps one of the more imperfect. Hot Fournier, ordered to turn thither by one Authority, to turn
 thither by another Authority, is in a perplexing multiplicity of
 orders; but finally he strikes off for Versailles. His Prisoners
 fare in tumbrils, or open carts, himself and Guards riding and
 marching around: and at the last village, the worthy Mayor of
 Versailles comes to meet him, anxious that the arrival and
 locking up were well over. It is Sunday, the ninth day of the
 month. Lo, on entering the Avenue of Versailles, what multitudes,
 stirring, swarming in the September sun, under the dull-green
 September foliage; the Four-rowed Avenue all humming and
 swarming, as if the Town had emptied itself! Our tumbrils roll
 heavily through the living sea; the Guards and Fournier making
 way with ever more difficulty; the Mayor speaking and gesturing
 his persuasivest; amid the inarticulate growling hum, which
 growls ever the deeper even by hearing itself growl, not without
 sharp yelpings here and there:—Would to God we were out of this
 strait place, and wind and separation had cooled the heat, which
 seems about igniting here! And yet if the wide Avenue is too strait, what will the Street
 _de Surintendance_ be, at leaving of the same? At the corner of
 Surintendance Street, the compressed yelpings became a continuous
 yell: savage figures spring on the tumbril-shafts; first spray of
 an endless coming tide! The Mayor pleads, pushes, half-desperate;
 is pushed, carried off in men’s arms: the savage tide has
 entrance, has mastery. Amid horrid noise, and tumult as of fierce
 wolves, the Prisoners sink massacred,—all but some eleven, who
 escaped into houses, and found mercy. The Prisons, and what other
 Prisoners they held, were with difficulty saved. The stript
 clothes are burnt in bonfire; the corpses lie heaped in the ditch
 on the morrow morning.[550] All France, except it be the Ten Men
 of the Circular and their people, moans and rages, inarticulately
 shrieking; all Europe rings. But neither did Danton shriek; though, as Minister of Justice, it
 was more his part to do so. Brawny Danton is in the breach, as of
 stormed Cities and Nations; amid the Sweep of Tenth-of-August
 cannon, the rustle of Prussian gallows-ropes, the smiting of
 September sabres; destruction all round him, and the rushing-down
 of worlds: Minister of Justice is his name; but Titan of the
 Forlorn Hope, and _Enfant Perdu_ of the Revolution, is his
 quality,—and the man acts according to that. ‘We must put our
 enemies in fear!’ Deep fear, is it not, as of its own accord,
 falling on our enemies? The Titan of the Forlorn Hope, he is not
 the man that would swiftest of all prevent its so falling.
 Forward, thou lost Titan of an _Enfant Perdu;_ thou must dare,
 and again dare, and without end dare; there is nothing left for
 thee but that! ‘_Que mon nom soit flétri_, Let my name be
 blighted:’ what am I? The Cause alone is great; and shall live,
 and not perish.—So, on the whole, here too is a swallower of
 Formulas; of still wider gulp than Mirabeau: this Danton,
 Mirabeau of the Sansculottes. In the September days, this
 Minister was not heard of as co-operating with strict Roland; his
 business might lie elsewhere,—with Brunswick and the
 Hôtel-de-Ville. When applied to by an official person, about the
 Orleans Prisoners, and the risks they ran, he answered gloomily,
 twice over, ‘Are not these men guilty?’—When pressed, he
 “answered in a terrible voice,” and turned his back.[551] Two
 Thousand slain in the Prisons; horrible if you will: but
 Brunswick is within a day’s journey of us; and there are Five-and
 twenty Millions yet, to slay or to save. Some men have
 tasks,—frightfuller than ours! It seems strange, but is not
 strange, that this Minister of Moloch-Justice, when any suppliant
 for a friend’s life got access to him, was found to have human
 compassion; and yielded and granted “always;” “neither did one
 personal enemy of Danton perish in these days.”[552]');

'{"document_id": "The French Revolution A History"}'::jsonb, ' To shriek, we say, when certain things are acted, is proper and
 unavoidable. Nevertheless, articulate speech, not shrieking, is
 the faculty of man: when speech is not yet possible, let there
 be, with the shortest delay, at least—silence. Silence,
 accordingly, in this forty-fourth year of the business, and
 eighteen hundred and thirty-sixth of an “Era called Christian as
 _lucus à non_,” is the thing we recommend and practise. Nay,
 instead of shrieking more, it were perhaps edifying to remark, on
 the other side, what a singular thing Customs (in Latin, _Mores_)
 are; and how fitly the Virtue, _Vir-tus_, Manhood or Worth, that
 is in a man, is called his _Morality_, or _Customariness_. Fell
 Slaughter, one the most authentic products of the Pit you would
 say, once give it Customs, becomes War, with Laws of War; and is
 Customary and Moral enough; and red individuals carry the tools
 of it girt round their haunches, not without an air of
 pride,—which do thou nowise blame. While, see! so long as it is
 but dressed in hodden or russet; and Revolution, less frequent
 than War, has not yet got its Laws of Revolution, but the hodden

 Chapter 3.1.VII.
 September in Argonne. Plain, at any rate, is one thing: that the _fear_, whatever of
 fear those Aristocrat enemies might need, has been brought about.
 The matter is getting serious then! Sansculottism too has become
 a Fact, and seems minded to assert itself as such? This huge
 mooncalf of Sansculottism, staggering about, as young calves do,
 is not mockable only, and soft like another calf; but terrible
 too, if you prick it; and, through its hideous nostrils, blows
 fire!—Aristocrats, with pale panic in their hearts, fly towards
 covert; and a light rises to them over several things; or rather
 a confused transition towards light, whereby for the moment
 darkness is only darker than ever. But, What will become of this
 France? Here is a question! France is dancing its desert-waltz,
 as Sahara does when the winds waken; in whirlblasts twenty-five
 millions in number; waltzing towards Townhalls, Aristocrat
 Prisons, and Election Committee-rooms; towards Brunswick and the
 Frontiers;—towards a New Chapter of Universal History; if indeed
 it be not the _Finis_, and winding-up of that! In Election Committee-rooms there is now no dubiety; but the work
 goes bravely along. The Convention is getting chosen,—really in a
 decisive spirit; in the Townhall we already date _First year of
 the Republic_. Some Two hundred of our best Legislators may be
 re-elected, the Mountain bodily: Robespierre, with Mayor Pétion,
 Buzot, Curate Grégoire, Rabaut, some three score
 Old-Constituents; though we once had only “thirty voices.” All
 these; and along with them, friends long known to Revolutionary
 fame: Camille Desmoulins, though he stutters in speech; Manuel,
 Tallien and Company; Journalists Gorsas, Carra, Mercier, Louvet
 of _Faublas;_ Clootz Speaker of Mankind; Collot d’Herbois,
 tearing a passion to rags; Fabre d’Eglantine, speculative
 Pamphleteer; Legendre the solid Butcher; nay Marat, though rural
 France can hardly believe it, or even believe that there _is_ a
 Marat except in print. Of Minister Danton, who will lay down his
 Ministry for a Membership, we need not speak. Paris is fervent;
 nor is the Country wanting to itself. Barbaroux, Rebecqui, and
 fervid Patriots are coming from Marseilles. Seven hundred and
 forty-five men (or indeed forty-nine, for Avignon now sends Four)
 are gathering: so many are to meet; not so many are to part! Attorney Carrier from Aurillac, Ex-Priest Lebon from Arras, these
 shall both gain a _name_. Mountainous Auvergne re-elects her
 Romme: hardy tiller of the soil, once Mathematical Professor;
 who, unconscious, carries in petto a remarkable _New Calendar_,
 with Messidors, Pluvioses, and such like;—and having given it
 well forth, shall depart by the death they call Roman. Sieyes
 old-Constituent comes; to make new Constitutions as many as
 wanted: for the rest, peering out of his clear cautious eyes, he
 will cower low in many an emergency, and find silence safest.
 Young Saint-Just is coming, deputed by Aisne in the North; more
 like a Student than a Senator: not four-and-twenty yet; who has
 written Books; a youth of slight stature, with mild mellow voice,
 enthusiast olive-complexion, and long dark hair. Féraud, from the
 far valley D’Aure in the folds of the Pyrenees, is coming; an
 ardent Republican; doomed to fame, at least in death. All manner of Patriot men are coming: Teachers, Husbandmen,
 Priests and Ex-Priests, Traders, Doctors; above all, Talkers, or
 the Attorney-species. Man-midwives, as Levasseur of the Sarthe,
 are not wanting. Nor Artists: gross David, with the swoln cheek,
 has long painted, with genius in a state of convulsion; and will
 now legislate. The swoln cheek, choking his words in the birth,
 totally disqualifies him as orator; but his pencil, his head, his
 gross hot heart, with genius in a state of convulsion, will be
 there. A man bodily and mentally swoln-cheeked, disproportionate;
 flabby-large, instead of great; weak withal as in a state of
 convulsion, not strong in a state of composure: so let him play
 his part. Nor are naturalised Benefactors of the Species
 forgotten: Priestley, elected by the Orne Department, but
 declining: Paine the rebellious Needleman, by the Pas de Calais,
 who accepts. Few Nobles come, and yet not none. Paul François Barras, “noble
 as the Barrases, old as the rocks of Provence;” he is one. The
 reckless, shipwrecked man: flung ashore on the coast of the
 Maldives long ago, while sailing and soldiering as Indian
 Fighter; flung ashore since then, as hungry Parisian
 Pleasure-hunter and Half-pay, on many a Circe Island, with
 temporary enchantment, temporary conversion into beasthood and
 hoghood;—the remote Var Department has now sent him hither. A man
 of heat and haste; defective in utterance; defective indeed in
 any thing to utter; yet not without a certain rapidity of glance,
 a certain swift transient courage; who, in these times, Fortune
 favouring, may go far. He is tall, handsome to the eye, “only the
 complexion a little yellow;” but “with a robe of purple with a
 scarlet cloak and plume of tricolor, on occasions of solemnity,”
 the man will look well.[553] Lepelletier Saint-Fargeau,
 Old-Constituent, is a kind of noble, and of enormous wealth; he
 too has come hither:—to have the Pain of Death _abolished?_
 Hapless Ex-Parlementeer! Nay, among our Sixty Old-Constituents,
 see Philippe d’Orléans a Prince of the Blood! Not now
 _D’Orléans:_ for, Feudalism being swept from the world, he
 demands of his worthy friends the Electors of Paris, to have a
 new name of their choosing; whereupon Procureur Manuel, like an
 antithetic literary man, recommends _Equality_, Egalité. A
 Philippe Egalité therefore will sit; seen of the Earth and
 Heaven. Such a Convention is gathering itself together. Mere angry
 poultry in moulting season; whom Brunswick’s grenadiers and
 cannoneers will give short account of. Would the weather only
 mend a little![554] In vain, O Bertrand! The weather will not mend a whit:—nay even
 if it did? Dumouriez Polymetis, though Bertrand knows it not,
 started from brief slumber at Sedan, on that morning of the 29th
 of August; with stealthiness, with promptitude, audacity. Some
 three mornings after that, Brunswick, opening wide eyes,
 perceives the Passes of the Argonne all seized; blocked with
 felled trees, fortified with camps; and that it is a most shifty
 swift Dumouriez this, who has outwitted him! The manœuvre may cost Brunswick “a loss of three weeks,” very
 fatal in these circumstances. A Mountain-wall of forty miles
 lying between him and Paris: which he should have
 preoccupied;—which how now to get possession of? Also the rain it
 raineth every day; and we are in a hungry Champagne Pouilleuse, a
 land flowing only with ditch-water. How to cross this
 Mountain-wall of the Argonne; or what in the world to do with
 it?—there are marchings and wet splashings by steep paths, with
 _sackerments_ and guttural interjections; forcings of Argonne
 Passes,—which unhappily will not force. Through the woods,
 volleying War reverberates, like huge gong-music, or Moloch’s
 kettledrum, borne by the echoes; swoln torrents boil angrily
 round the foot of rocks, floating pale carcasses of men. In vain!
 Islettes Village, with its church-steeple, rises intact in the
 Mountain-pass, between the embosoming heights; your forced
 marchings and climbings have become forced slidings, and
 tumblings back. From the hill-tops thou seest nothing but dumb
 crags, and endless wet moaning woods; the Clermont _Vache_ (huge
 Cow that she is) disclosing herself[555] at intervals; flinging
 off her cloud-blanket, and soon taking it on again, drowned in
 the pouring Heaven. The Argonne Passes will not force: you must
 _skirt_ the Argonne; go round by the end of it. But fancy whether the Emigrant Seigneurs have not got their
 brilliancy dulled a little; whether that “Foot Regiment in
 red-facings with nankeen trousers” could be in field-day order!
 In place of gasconading, a sort of desperation, and hydrophobia
 from _excess_ of water, is threatening to supervene. Young Prince
 de Ligne, son of that brave literary De Ligne the Thundergod of
 Dandies, fell backwards; shot dead in Grand-Pré, the Northmost of
 the Passes: Brunswick is skirting and rounding, laboriously, by
 the extremity of the South. Four days; days of a rain as of
 Noah,—without fire, without food! For fire you cut down green
 trees, and produce smoke; for food you eat green grapes, and
 produce colic, pestilential dysentery, ὀλέκοντο δὲ λαοί. And the
 Peasants assassinate us, they do not join us; shrill women cry
 shame on us, threaten to draw their very scissors on us! O ye
 hapless dulled-bright Seigneurs, and hydrophobic splashed
 Nankeens;—but O, ten times more, ye poor _sackerment_ing
 ghastly-visaged Hessians and Hulans, fallen on your backs; who
 had no call to die there, except compulsion and three-halfpence
 a-day! Nor has Mrs. Le Blanc of the Golden Arm a good time of it,
 in her bower of dripping rushes. Assassinating Peasants are
 hanged; Old-Constituent Honourable members, though of venerable
 age, ride in carts with their hands tied; these are the woes of
 war. Thus they; sprawling and wriggling, far and wide, on the slopes
 and passes of the Argonne;—a loss to Brunswick of five-and-twenty
 disastrous days. There is wriggling and struggling; facing,
 backing, and right-about facing; as the positions shift, and the
 Argonne gets partly rounded, partly forced:—but still Dumouriez,
 force him, round him as you will, sticks like a rooted fixture on
 the ground; fixture with many _hinges;_ wheeling now this way,
 now that; shewing always new front, in the most unexpected
 manner: nowise consenting to take himself away. Recruits stream
 up on him: full of heart; yet rather difficult to deal with.
 Behind Grand-Pré, for example, Grand-Pré which is on the
 wrong-side of the Argonne, for we are now forced and rounded,—the
 full heart, in one of those wheelings and shewings of new front,
 did as it were overset itself, as full hearts are liable to do;
 and there rose a shriek of _sauve qui peut_, and a death-panic
 which had nigh ruined all! So that the General had to come
 galloping; and, with thunder-words, with gesture, stroke of drawn
 sword even, check and rally, and bring back the sense of
 shame;[556]—nay to seize the first shriekers and ringleaders;
 “shave their heads and eyebrows,” and pack them forth into the
 world as a sign. Thus too (for really the rations are short, and
 wet camping with hungry stomach brings bad humour) there is like
 to be mutiny. Whereupon again Dumouriez “arrives at the head of
 their line, with his staff, and an escort of a hundred huzzars.
 He had placed some squadrons behind th');
